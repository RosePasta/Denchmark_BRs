When I checked, it was taking whole file as single task.\n To Reproduce\n Steps to reproduce the behavior:\n \n Use a text file as the input dataset\n Run label-studio start-multi-session --input-path=<path to text file> --input-format=text -l <path to config file>\n \n Expected behavior\n It should import each line in the file as separate task\n Environment (please complete the following information):\n \n OS: Mac\n Version : 0.5\n \n \n After debugging for some time and going through code, I found that issue is at <denchmark-link:https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/blob/master/label_studio/tasks.py#L90>function that reads from text file</denchmark-link>\n  . When we read from file,  is not incremented.\n \t"}, "comments": {}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "ef54d0a6cf5c2bce61c02f5e76ad5517a9e6a4c2", "commit_author": "Gautham Suresh", "commitT": "2020-04-21 23:38:27+03:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "label_studio\\tasks.py", "file_new_name": "label_studio\\tasks.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "91", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "from_text_file", "method_params": "self,path,data_key,start_task_id", "method_startline": "85", "method_endline": "92"}}}}}}}
