I --resumed 2 models that had quit unexpectedly. These two models should have the updated scheduler PR in place. Unfortunately I still see the same style of recovery.\n One major aspect I noticed is that in both cases the train losses recover very quickly, within a few epochs, while the validation losses and performance metrics both take very long to recover. The one thing the val losses and performance metrics have in common is they use the EMA, whereas train losses are displayed for the base model.\n This makes sense, as when a new run is started, or if a run is --resumed, a new EMA is created, and it uses a sliding decay constant that starts from zero and trends towards its final value 0.9999 after a few thousand iterations. This means the resumed EMA's are losing their smoothness, they are turning basically into base models, and slowly becoming a smoothed EMA over many epochs.\n I think there's an easy way to fix this then without having to include the base model in the checkpoints: just add a flag to the EMA init() function that tells it how many iterations the baseline model has trained for, so it knows what to set the decay constant to. Then training should align much more closely with training before --resume.

On COCO this might be 5-10 epochs or more, so for smaller datasets (like perhaps your example) the problem would not show up.

I still think that using base model for --resume training is right if save both of EMA and base model will not cost too much. My point is that base model is base model and EMA is  EMA, it's not reasonable to use EMA for training when  --resume, cause we use base model for training before --resume. perhaps I think too much, there still need some experiment to do.\n \t\t"}, "comments_10": {"comment_id": 11, "comment_author": "Laughing-q", "commentT": "2020-07-09T17:14:08Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/Laughing-q>@Laughing-q</denchmark-link>\n  I don't really know.

It seems things do eventually return to normal after 20 or so epochs, which is the right amount of time for the EMA decay to reach steady state.\n Probably the correct way to think about the EMA is that in the early stages of training it is trailing the model. It is smoother, less noisy, and delayed in time following the model changes. In the later stages of training, it is not trailing anymore, it is more a mean or centered version of the model. As the model oscillates or moves about a local minima the EMA will be at rest near the local minima more or less is how I imagine it. To further complicate it, the decay rise I've added means that the EMA and the model behave very similarly in the very early stages of training, but this is not important really in the final result.\n <denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/87072863-55cc4f00-c1d1-11ea-9aa7-c94ab11477e4.png></denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_12": {"comment_id": 13, "comment_author": "Laughing-q", "commentT": "2020-07-10T02:11:36Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher>@glenn-jocher</denchmark-link>\n  I see, thanks for your fix.

I think I may be accepting too many PRs too quickly. Often times PRs are not rebased against the current master and the PR inadvertently reverts earlier changes. It's a huge problem with no easy solution, so I'm being much more careful with larger PRs now.\n Ok, about this particular issue, can you submit a new PR please?
