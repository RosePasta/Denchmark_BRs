This was caused by a change to the 'sentinel values' on the P and R vectors here:\n     # Append sentinel values to beginning and end\n     mrec = recall  # np.concatenate(([0.], recall, [recall[-1] + 1E-3]))\n     mpre = precision  # np.concatenate(([0.], precision, [0.]))\n The appropriate solution would be to reinstitute the old code, which drops the curves to zero after their last data point, or to interpolate it to zero at recall = 1. I'll experiment with both and implement a fix soon.\n This does not affect any operations using the default test.py --conf 0.001, so I would imagine almost no users would be impacted by this, but it needs fixing in any case.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "glenn-jocher", "commentT": "2020-11-21T11:45:22Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tA third option would be to extrapolate the curves to zero based on their last known derivatives.
