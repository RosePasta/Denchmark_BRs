Instead of checking for the \"label\" key, you must look for self.tasks[\"regression\"][\"label_name\"]\n Error message\n Silent error.\n Expected behavior\n RegressionProcessor should store regression label mean and std dev values only for train set. And standardization must be performed on the actual labels.\n Additional context\n \n add print statements to view the output of <denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/blob/master/farm/data_handler/processor.py#L1603>this function</denchmark-link>\n  and you will see that standardization of regression label is not taking place.\n System:\n \n OS: Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS\n GPU/CPU: Both\n FARM version: 0.4.5\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "rohanag", "commentT": "2020-07-10T03:03:00Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI'm also trying to push a fix but I get\n fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403\n Just wondering if the problem is on my end, or if there is an actual permission issue.\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "rohanag", "commentT": "2020-07-10T06:35:09Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/rohanag>@rohanag</denchmark-link>\n  thanks for spotting this.
