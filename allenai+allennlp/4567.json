I'm already doing that for training new models. However, several of my models are already trained without the validation_data_loader being set. For config change to take affect, I'd have to do unarchive model.tar.gz, tweak config, rearchive for every trained model and only then use it. Other option is to pass validation_data_loader  via overrides for every evaluate command I run. I figured, for my purpose at least, hardcoding to pop off batches_per_epoch  from validation dataloader would be easier. : )\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "dirkgr", "commentT": "2020-10-15T21:39:44Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThe way we want to fix this is this:\n When params for the validation data loader are not explicitly set, and therefore they are inherited from the training data loader, and the training data loader specifies batches_per_epoch, then we show a warning.\n That is all.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "6bb9ce9a188631eeeb49d4e73dccf5860549e42d", "commit_author": "Evan Pete Walsh", "commitT": "2020-10-20 09:13:53-07:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "CHANGELOG.md", "file_new_name": "CHANGELOG.md", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "12,13", "deleted_lines": null}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "allennlp\\commands\\train.py", "file_new_name": "allennlp\\commands\\train.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "12,686,687,688,689,690,691,692,693", "deleted_lines": null}}}, "file_2": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "tests\\commands\\train_test.py", "file_new_name": "tests\\commands\\train_test.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "891,892,893,894", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "test_warn_validation_loader_batches_per_epoch", "method_params": "self", "method_startline": "891", "method_endline": "894"}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": null, "deleted_lines": "767,768", "method_info": {"method_name": "test_dry_run_without_vocabulary_key", "method_params": "self", "method_startline": "767", "method_endline": "768"}}}}}}}
