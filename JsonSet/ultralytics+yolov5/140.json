I was able to reproduce your error with a dataset that contained fewer images than my batch size.\n Decreasing the batch size to be smaller than your training dataset size may resolve your issue. e.g.:\n !python train.py --img 416 --batch 2 --epochs 300 --data '../data.yaml' --cfg ./models/custom_yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --name yolov5s_results --nosave --cache\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "jitunayak", "commentT": "2020-06-26T00:37:24Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/josephofiowa>@josephofiowa</denchmark-link>\n  ah, interesting.
