I cannot successfully call load_model and the code as supplied seems to have a channel ordering issue around average pooling that I can't seem to work around. Sorry.\n On the JS side, however, I saw the following:\n \n WebGL backend returned nearly same results (-1.0285303592681885 mine vs. -1.028530240058899 reported )\n tf.ENV.set('WEBGL_PACK',false) returned similar results (-1.0285298824310303)\n tf.setBackend('cpu') returned -0.7186653017997742\n \n Also, here is the output of tf.ENV for my WebGL backend:\n \u200b\n DEBUG: false\n \u200b\u200bHAS_WEBGL: true\n \u200b\u200bIS_BROWSER: true\n \u200b\u200bPROD: false\n \u200b\u200bTENSORLIKE_CHECK_SHAPE_CONSISTENCY: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_CONV_IM2COL: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_CPU_FORWARD: false\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_DOWNLOAD_FLOAT_ENABLED: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_LAZILY_UNPACK: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE: 16384\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_PACK: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_PACK_ARRAY_OPERATIONS: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_PACK_BINARY_OPERATIONS: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_PACK_CLIP: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_PACK_NORMALIZATION: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_RENDER_FLOAT32_ENABLED: true\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_SIZE_UPLOAD_UNIFORM: 4\n \u200b\u200bWEBGL_VERSION: 2\n The conversion parameters were not specified so I verified that there were e.g. no issues with quantization. I converted the model as follows: tensorflowjs_converter --input_format=keras --output_format=tfjs_layers_model fit_example6.h5 convert_vanilla. I am on tensorflowjs 1.2.10.1. The weight shard file was md5sum same as the one supplied, and using the converted model produced similar results.\n I also tried converting tfjs_graph_model but ran into issues because I don't have the original loss function, similar to load_model above.\n So it is still a mystery. I find it interesting that the CPU results were closer to the WebGL results than the desired answer but still off significantly. Assuming that CPU and WebGL are in accord with each other, that makes me wonder if there isn't some piece that is right on an edge of relative numerical instability such that changes in precision are hurting accuracy badly.\n Thoughts from somebody who knows more? Also, <denchmark-link:https://github.com/joyicejin>@joyicejin</denchmark-link>\n  , do you seem similarly incorrect results for all inputs? Or do some inputs work more or less as expected?\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "joyicejin", "commentT": "2019-10-22T09:43:19Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tOk, many thanks for all your kind reply and providing information about this issue.\n For your metioned above in reply 2 on python side, I want to say.\n First, it was trained on a tensorflow-gpu machine and only gpu devices could make a prediction for my provided python predict code provided above.\n Second, yes, it was trained by a self-defined loss function as code below:\n <denchmark-code>def self_error(y_true, y_pred):\n     return abs(y_true) * math_ops.square(y_pred - y_true)\n \n model = ShallowConvNet(Chans=chans, Samples=samples,\n                        dropoutRate=0.5)\n model.compile(loss=self_error, optimizer='adam',\n               metrics=['accuracy'])\n \n checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath='./jin.h5', verbose=1, monitor='val_loss',\n                                save_best_only=True)\n \n model.fit(X0_train, Y0_train, batch_size=20, epochs=100,\n           validation_data=(X0_valid, Y0_valid), shuffle=True, verbose=1, callbacks=[checkpointer])\n \n </denchmark-code>\n \n I also used model.save function to save the trained model, but having the same problem of loading model by load_model function.\n I know you're not available for a gpu device, so do you mind to take a remote control of my computer to take a look at the python implementation of the prediction process?\n Third, I tried to use the cpu version of tensorflow, it also occurs the channel ordering issue around average pooling.\n So you may need to make a predict on a gpu device using tensorflow-gpu.\n As it is channel first input format in conv layers and pooling layers.(I also mentioned it in Browser version configurations in my question).\n So the input tensor shape in my model is NCHW not NHWC.\n For reply 3, I'm sorry to say that I'm new to webGL.

I did get it working with a hack. Steps are very close to your original code.\n \n I create network in code, as your original code did.\n However, I add a Permute layer before the Flatten step. I do this because Flatten on the Tensorflow.js does not seem to respect data_format one way or the other. See here. This mimics the channels_first.\n Load the weights from your original network. Permute has no weights so this works?\n Save the permuted model, network architecture and weights.\n Convert using tensorflowjs_converter as normal.\n \n Relevant code section for Permute:\n <denchmark-code>    block1 = Dropout(dropoutRate)(block1)\n     block1 = Permute((3,1,2))(block1)\n     flatten = Flatten()(block1)\n </denchmark-code>\n \n Now in JS I get 1.3110136985778809.\n I have attached the model!\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/files/3765792/fit_example6_permuted.zip>fit_example6_permuted.zip</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/joyicejin>@joyicejin</denchmark-link>\n  <denchmark-link:https://github.com/caisq>@caisq</denchmark-link>\n  I think perhaps the next action is to either convert this issue or create a new bug to be something like \"Flatten layer should respect data_format\".

The immediate support case has a workaround and can be resolved; however, this likely points to a need to do something further. I can see this being followed up on in a few ways but I'm not sure which one:\n \n Enter a bug like \"Flatten layer should respect data_format\"\n Enter a bug like \"Converter should warn that Flatten does not support data_format x\"\n Enter a feature request \"Add data_format support for Flatten layer.\"\n \n ... or possibly something else.
