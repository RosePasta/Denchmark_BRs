The problem is we are using ray autoscaling on kubernetes and e.g. in google cloud we have an additional system which scales physical nodes when there is no space for additional pods anymore.\n So when Ray autoscaling decides to start a new GPU worker for example, first a new Google Cloud VM has to be started, NVIDIA drivers have to be installed etc, then the docker image for the worker pod has to be downloaded into the newly created VM and only after this the Pod becomes \"ready\". This whole proces (before SSHing into the pod becomes possible) takes longer than 300s.\n Currently our issue is resolved by patching the ray code (replacing  with ), but being able to configure it would be a lot cleaner... :)\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "589555455548bca0aeaf434cdeb83f3bf4999446", "commit_author": "Eric Liang", "commitT": "2020-11-24 12:16:01-08:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "python\\ray\\autoscaler\\_private\\command_runner.py", "file_new_name": "python\\ray\\autoscaler\\_private\\command_runner.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "17,18", "deleted_lines": "17,36"}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "python\\ray\\autoscaler\\_private\\constants.py", "file_new_name": "python\\ray\\autoscaler\\_private\\constants.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "15,16,17", "deleted_lines": null}}}}}}
