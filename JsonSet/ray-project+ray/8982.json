The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):\n just use run_string_as_driver in any file that already has psutil/setproctitle imported.\n If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.\n \n  I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.\n  I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "WangTaoTheTonic", "commentT": "2020-06-19T21:19:52Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tgreat issue! would you be ok with pushing a fix?\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "WangTaoTheTonic", "commentT": "2020-06-24T09:26:17Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t\n great issue! would you be ok with pushing a fix?\n \n Pull request filed.
