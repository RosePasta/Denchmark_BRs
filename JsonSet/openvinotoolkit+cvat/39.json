It might take the program ~1 sec to become responsive again after creating a new bbox. After about 800-1000 annotations, it's nearly unusable -- adding an annotation might require ~5 seconds before it will register. For now, I'm just cropping my large images into smaller pieces as a workaround, but it'd be a lot nicer to add all annotations to a single large image (as raw satellite imagery often comes in fairly long strips). I'm using a 2017 MacBook pro to do the labeling.\n I don't know enough about the backend to suggest a fix, but happy to answer questions if it's helpful.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "wronk", "commentT": "2018-08-27T11:24:50Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/wronk>@wronk</denchmark-link>\n  ,\n We will look at the problem.

My guess that huge image resolution can be a reason for that. Did you crop the attached image or it has original size?\n \n We will work to resolve both problems.

I do have 2 versions of the image, but I think I have the correct one included here. I was able to remake the task with the included files.\n I did have an issue where I had to manually change the version tags in the annotation file to get it to sync properly to a newly created task. Specifically, these lines in the xml file need to match the task you create (e.g., task 25) on your cvat instance:\n <denchmark-code>  <meta>\n     <task>\n       <id>25</id>\n </denchmark-code>\n \n <denchmark-code>        <segment> \n          <id>25</id>\n           <start>25</start>\n           <stop>25</stop>\n           <url>http://localhost:8080/?id=25</url>\n         </segment>\n </denchmark-code>\n \n Let me know if that fixes it for you\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "758c9c2752880623bcfa7a47100d94893cbc515b", "commit_author": "Boris Sekachev", "commitT": "2018-10-01 18:25:21+03:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "CHANGELOG.md", "file_new_name": "CHANGELOG.md", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "17,18,19", "deleted_lines": null}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "cvat\\apps\\engine\\static\\engine\\js\\attributeAnnotationMode.js", "file_new_name": "cvat\\apps\\engine\\static\\engine\\js\\attributeAnnotationMode.js", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "188", "deleted_lines": "188", "method_info": {"method_name": "moveShape", "method_params": "direction", "method_startline": "182", "method_endline": "205"}}}}, "file_2": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 3, "file_old_name": "cvat\\apps\\engine\\static\\engine\\js\\shapeCollection.js", "file_new_name": "cvat\\apps\\engine\\static\\engine\\js\\shapeCollection.js", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "124", "deleted_lines": "124", "method_info": {"method_name": "_interpolate", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "111", "method_endline": "126"}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "1273,1279,1280", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "drawView", "method_params": "shape,model", "method_startline": "1273", "method_endline": "1282"}}, "hunk_2": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "1221", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "newShapes.map", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "1221", "method_endline": "1221"}}}}, "file_3": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "cvat\\apps\\engine\\static\\engine\\js\\shapes.js", "file_new_name": "cvat\\apps\\engine\\static\\engine\\js\\shapes.js", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "1793", "deleted_lines": "1793", "method_info": {"method_name": "_drawMenu", "method_params": "outside", "method_startline": "1764", "method_endline": "2155"}}}}}}}
