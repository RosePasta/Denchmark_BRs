It's clearly not an http URL. Therefore I believe this documentation is incorrect / incomplete.\n I have yet to get my app compiling with a custom build of TensorFlowLite, so I don't know the solution. Any help appreciated.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "alexdmiller", "commentT": "2020-11-24T19:30:35Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tEveryone here says this works: <denchmark-link:https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-packager/issues/216#issuecomment-513514364>CocoaPods/cocoapods-packager#216 (comment)</denchmark-link>\n \n You just need a triple / like file:///path. file:// is the protocol,  /path is the path\n <denchmark-code>$ curl file://path\n \n curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL\n </denchmark-code>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "alexdmiller", "commentT": "2020-11-24T19:36:12Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI'm sending a little fix to make this clearer.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "cfe685d8127222d01125893909be092b4dd7ae89", "commit_author": "Mark Daoust", "commitT": "2020-11-25 05:01:10-08:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "tensorflow\\lite\\g3doc\\guide\\build_ios.md", "file_new_name": "tensorflow\\lite\\g3doc\\guide\\build_ios.md", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "128,129", "deleted_lines": "128"}}}}}}
