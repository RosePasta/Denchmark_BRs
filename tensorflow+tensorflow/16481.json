It has to do with creating functions and capturing control dependencies of these functions. Currently, functions are created in a separate graphs and tensors that are used as inputs are captured and replaced with placeholders to be fed later. What about control dependencies that some of the new ops might have on ops defined outside the function? For example, I have a dataset map op that uses a lookup table, but I want the iterator initializer op for that dataset to have a control dependency on the lookup table initializer op of the outer graph. How should I go about handling that? Currently I get an error of the form , where  refers to the source of the control edge.

That change modifies most iterators to use the same , , and  as the op that created them, which enables the resource-capturing logic to be simplified, because handles are valid in both the caller and the callee.\n However, when the shared_name is set, the iterator might outlive the FunctionLibraryRuntime used by the op that created it. The new code identifies this case and creates its own private FunctionLibrary, Device, and ResourceMgr that will outlive the caller. Unfortunately, this means that the handles from the caller and no longer valid in the callee, which manifests as a NotFoundError.\n Thanks for the promising lead on this bug!
