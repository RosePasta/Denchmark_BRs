While this is not a problem if we are just dealing with LR since the value will technically never go below min_lr, it is an issue if you are trying to do any other execution in this block of code (ie. weight decay).\n Given that there is a min check for this block of code, i assume it was not intended for us to enter this block of code if min_lr has already been achieved. Either get rid of the min check if we don't care about re-executing this code for no reason, or make sure this block of code is not executed if lr is at min-lr.\n This issue clearly seems to be a round/precision related issue where\n we set our lr K.set_value(self.model.optimizer.lr, new_lr)\n But then next iteration we fetch the lr\n old_lr = float(K.get_value(self.model.optimizer.lr))\n and get a slightly different value so that\n if old_lr > self.min_lr:\n does not work.\n So yes in a way this does not affect default code, and it only matter if we do custom code, but i still think this is a bug that really shouldn't happen.\n Describe the expected behavior\n Code block that is only supposed to execute if lr does not equal min_lr does not execute if lr equals min_lr\n Standalone code to reproduce the issue\n Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate\n the problem.
