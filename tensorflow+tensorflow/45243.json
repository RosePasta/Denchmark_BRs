However, it is quite common that user forget to call this method before they feed the data to model, which result into poor result. When we realized this problem, we move the preprocessing logic from this method to the model itself for some new models (like mobilenet_v3). In order to keep the alignment between old and new model, we still keep this method for new model, but as an empty shell, so that user can easily switching between different version of models without changing much code.\n I will update the docstring for this method to make it align with the implementation detail.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "52cdef300393aa1e2a4220030f77839edbae8bd3", "commit_author": "Scott Zhu", "commitT": "2020-12-08 12:12:21-08:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "tensorflow\\python\\keras\\applications\\mobilenet_v3.py", "file_new_name": "tensorflow\\python\\keras\\applications\\mobilenet_v3.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "557,558,559,560,561,562,563,564,565,566,567,568,569,570,571,572,573,574", "deleted_lines": "566,567,568,569", "method_info": {"method_name": "preprocess_input", "method_params": "x,data_format", "method_startline": "556", "method_endline": "575"}}}}}}}
