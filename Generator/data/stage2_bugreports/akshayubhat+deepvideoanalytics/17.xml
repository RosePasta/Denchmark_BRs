	<summary>Examine scene detection frame index number for correctness</summary>
	<description>
scene detection frame index appear to be slightly different that those returned by ffmpeg. Try an alternative strategy which uses only ffmpeg to extract frames (every 10th frame) and then keep only frames which are different enough in addition to every nth frame.

		Turns out there is a mistake in how frames were assigned index after extraction via ffmpeg. The first frame should be 0th frame rathern nth where when sampling every nth frame. This should hopefully fix this.
