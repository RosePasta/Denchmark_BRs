	<summary>Where  is MPI-FAUST/training/ref/reg_color_ref.ply?</summary>
	<description>
Thanks for your jobs. The README file is detailedã€‚
However, in generate_data_human.py, there exist one file I can't find.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mesh_ref = pymesh.load_mesh("/home/thibault/Downloads/MPI-FAUST/training/ref/reg_color_ref.ply")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have download MPI-FAUST dataset, but the sub-directory [training] has no directory named [ref].
Also, it seems that the MPI-FAUST dataset you used is different from what I download from the website. Do you sure that you download the FAUST dataset from &lt;denchmark-link:http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de/challenge/Inter-subject_challenge&gt;http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de/challenge/Inter-subject_challenge&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . And you have no further process?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zeal-github&gt;@zeal-github&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for pointing this out.
reg_color_ref is just the first training example of FAUST; centered and colorized. I've included it in template/template_color.ply. You can git pull.
Best regards,
Thibault

 Thanks for your reply.
I can't create a conda env using this file .
Conda put out a error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; ValueError: Incompatible component merge:
      - '0'
      - 'h1d4fec5_0'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I don't know why.
My configuration:
system: ubuntu 14/16
conda: ananconda3
I just want to make sure that the .yml file is latest.

I commited an update of the list of dependencies and ran a clean install. it worked for me.
