	<summary>[Bug] different learning rates cause an error</summary>
	<description>
I tried to adapt scheduler and got these exceptions which has to do with cholesky.py
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    outputs = self.forward(*inputs, **kwargs)
  File "o_different.py", line 67, in forward
    res = self.gp_layer(features)
  File "/anaconda3/envs/my_env_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gpytorch/models/abstract_variational_gp.py", line 22, in __call__
    return self.variational_strategy(inputs)
  File "/anaconda3/envs/my_env_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gpytorch/variational/variational_strategy.py", line 223, in __call__
    self.initialize_variational_dist()
  File "/anaconda3/envs/my_env_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gpytorch/variational/variational_strategy.py", line 93, in initialize_variational_dist
    scale_tril=psd_safe_cholesky(prior_dist.covariance_matrix),

    L = torch.cholesky(A, upper=upper, out=out)
RuntimeError: CUDA error: invalid device function

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		it was the case when the lr = 3e-4, rest is the same (the single difference was this lr change)

		In my experience, that kind of error usually ends up not being a gpytorch issue, but a strange nvidia driver issue or something on the pytorch end. I've often been able to resolve it just by restarting my computer or updating CUDA and the like.
In general, we have little to no low level custom CUDA code, so errors like that are typically not on our end.

		correct, since the same file was executable on another machine
