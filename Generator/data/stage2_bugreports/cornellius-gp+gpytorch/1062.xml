	<summary>[Bug] ImportError in Fully Bayesian GPs Example</summary>
	<description>
I ran block [4] of this tutorial:
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://gpytorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/01_Exact_GPs/GP_Regression_Fully_Bayesian.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and I got this error
ImportError: cannot import name 'LogNormalPrior' from 'gpytorch.priors'
Note: I installed pyro using pip install pyro-ppl

		To me this sounds like you might be using an older version of GPyTorch. Can you print what version you're running? import gpytorch; print(gpytorch.__version__)

		Yes, that is probably the issue. I am running 0.3.6 of GPyTorch.

I think when I installed pyro it gave me an earlier version of GPyTorch. I
installed Botorch on a Conda environment and then used "pip install
pyro-ppl" to install pyro in my environment. Do know of a better way to get
Pyro/Gpytorch working together?

 using a clean env works fine for me:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;conda create -n test_pyro
conda activate test_pyro
conda install -c pytorch -c gpytorch botorch
pip install pyro-ppl
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This ends up with an env with the latest releases, in particular 1.0.1 for gpytorch.
What OS are you on? Did you make sure your pip was the pip of the conda env and wasn't masked somehow? Make sure to pip install -U everything when in doubt to make sure to upgrade any old versions around.

		Thank you Geoff and Max. Max's instructions worked for me. Not sure what I
did before to break it.
