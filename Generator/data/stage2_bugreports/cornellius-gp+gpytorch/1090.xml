	<summary>[Bug] dimension error raised in VariationalStrategy</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;🐛 Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In my case,  the inducing points have the dimension as torch.Size([10, 50, 4])
where 10 is the number of inducing points, 4 is the input channels and 50 is the number input sequences.
so the model would be output(1x3) =  model(intput(50x4))
however, in variational_strategy.py
line 86: full_inputs = torch.cat([inducing_points, x], dim=-2)
line 91: num_induc = inducing_points.size(-2)
In my case, the dimension -2 is not the number of inducing point.
Thank you and looking forward to your reply.
