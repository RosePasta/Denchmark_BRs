	<summary>conda wants to instal 0.3.6 instead of 1.0.0 on windows</summary>
	<description>
The following installs gpytorch 1.0.0 just fine on OSX:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;conda install -c pytorch pytorch cpuonly
conda install -c gpytorch gpytorcy
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, when on Windows 10 (run in a VM), this results in conda wanting to install 0.3.6 instead.
I don't understand why, since the conda package is architecture-independent, and both the OSX and the Win10 installation have pytorch 1.3.1 installed before installing gpytorch.

		This should have been fixed by the release of 1.0.1 where we actually remembered to bump the version number in __init__.py.
Reopen if it's still an issue.
