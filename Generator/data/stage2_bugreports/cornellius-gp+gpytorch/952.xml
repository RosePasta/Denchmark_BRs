	<summary>[Bug] probe_vectors should NOT be unit norm functions/_inv_quad_log_det.py?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In functions/_inv_quad_log_det.py I see that probe_vectors are set to unit
norm:

        probe_vectors = probe_vectors.div(probe_vector_norms)


and, as I show below, I think this is a mistake.
As in page 4 of Gardner et al, 2018, suppose I want to estimate the trace of
the identity matrix I_m in R^m and that A is an invertible matrix in R^{nxn}.
Then:
Tr(I_m) = Tr(AxA^{-1}) ~ 1/t \sum_{i=1}^t z_i^T A A^{-1} z_i =
= 1/t \sum_{i=1}^t z_i^T z_i = (because z_i unit norm)
= 1/t \sum_{i=1}^t 1 = 1
But Tr(I_m) equals m.

		In the first line after Equation r in Gardner et al., 2018 it says:
"is an unbiased estimation of the derivative." but I guess it should say "is an unbiased estimation of the trace." Correct? or am I missing something?

 It's so that the projection of the probe vector on to the Krylov subspace Q'z is e_1 rather than ||z||e_1. See e.g. algorithm 1 &lt;denchmark-link:https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/PDF/ys-2016-04.pdf&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Note that in the backward pass we remultiply by the probe vector norm because there we directly do a trace estimate and need the vectors unnormalized:


Both the trace estimate and the gradient estimate are unbiased, so I suppose either would work there.
