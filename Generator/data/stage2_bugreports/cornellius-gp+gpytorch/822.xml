	<summary>[Bug] Upstream changes to tensor comparisons breaks things</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/21113&gt;pytorch/pytorch#21113&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 a bunch of tests are failing b/c of the change in tensor comparison behavior (return type from uint8 to bool). Creating this issue to track the fix.

		It appears most of this happens in batch_symeig where we do 1 - mask - will put up a fix shortly.

, we have introduced '~' operator for masks to fix this issue. You should be able to just replace '1-mask' with '~mask'

		Sure that works. There are a few other places in the code where this causes failures, but they should be easy enough to fix.

		Ok of course there are now a bunch more warnings emitted when using uint8 on pytorch master, so all the tests that count the warnings fail there ...

		It's worse than that, the change actually breaks the jit script code for _jit_linear_cg_updates. So the correct thing is to use bool everywhere, and fix the tests that count the warnings...

		Won't be able to fix all this properly right now, deferring to the above issue.

 I'll take a look once the nightly build comes out and I can repro the errors without having to build pytorch from source.

 sounds good, if you base this on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/pull/825&gt;#825&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 at least you won't have to deal with the warnings.

		Fwiw, here's a notebook that shows the failure (commented out the jit decorators locally).
It only happens when broadcasting. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/izdeby&gt;@izdeby&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, maybe broadcasting semantics for bool tensors are different?

, what exactly failed in broadcasting for you? there shouldn't be any difference in broadcasting semantics for bool tensors

 looks like this is a different issue related to changing sizes in , see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/pull/827&gt;#827&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		For now do we think we could define like a gpytorch.bool type to be torch.bool if that will work (i.e. we are on master), and torch.uint8 otherwise?
		</comment>
		<comment id='14' author='Balandat' date='2019-08-02T17:21:00Z'>
		We could similarly define gpytorch.not to do ~ and 1 - ... respectively
		</comment>
		<comment id='15' author='Balandat' date='2019-08-02T17:29:07Z'>
		So ~ will work even with uint8, so there is no need for that. But we can do the gpytorch.bool thing to avoid the mass of warnings

		<comment id='16' author='Balandat' date='2019-08-02T17:46:59Z'>
		made this change in the latest update to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/pull/827&gt;#827&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Reasonably fixed for now via &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/pull/827&gt;#827&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
