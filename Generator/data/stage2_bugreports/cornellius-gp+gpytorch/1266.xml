	<summary>[Bug] Typo in doc - Matern Kernel</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Should the documentation here &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.gpytorch.ai/en/v1.1.1/kernels.html#maternkernel&gt;https://docs.gpytorch.ai/en/v1.1.1/kernels.html#maternkernel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 have $ \Theta^{-2}$ in the definition of  like the other kernels (example RBF)?

		That does seem like a typo: 


gpytorch/gpytorch/kernels/matern_kernel.py


         Line 100
      in
      169b3ad






 x1_ = (x1 - mean).div(self.lengthscale)

		Is d defined a different way then? Maybe it should be $d=\sqrt( (x_1 - x_2)^T (x_1-x_2))$ when $\theta=1$. Otherwise the units don't seem to add up.
Also, I think that equation you are pointing to seems to suggest that when I take that x1_ and (x2_) and put it in the formula for d in the doc, then there would be a lengthscale^2 in the denominator.

		d should be the distance after rescaling, so $d = \sqrt((x_1-x_2)^\top \Theta^{-2} (x_1 - x_2))$
