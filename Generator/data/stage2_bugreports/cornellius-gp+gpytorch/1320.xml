	<summary>Time for bugfix release?</summary>
	<description>
I just hit a combination of:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/commit/5bff5be87be033f2d3a95423557b5af3dbf1746b&gt;5bff5be&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/commit/903ae8bac6f35b250a0a3f58302935510d336f57&gt;903ae8b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and it was very painful to debug.
Would it be possible to make a 1.2.1 bugfix release?
I am running the nightly now, so it's fixed for me, but I don't wish anyone else the same bug chase experience. :)
Thanks for your work! I thoroughly enjoy GPyTorch.

		Can do! I'm going to try to squeeze in one or two more bug fixes today - then I'll cut a release later today/early tomorrow.
