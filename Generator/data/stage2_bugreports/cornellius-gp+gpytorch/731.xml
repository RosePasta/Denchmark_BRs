	<summary>[Bug] Problem installing gpytorch into Kaggle kernel</summary>
	<description>
I tried to install gpytorch into Kaggle kernel:
pip install gpytorch
But, I am getting the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Collecting gpytorch
  Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('&lt;pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7fd9c6743630&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/gpytorch/

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

How can this issue be resolved?

		Uhm I've honestly never seen this before. Does pip install gpytorch work for you locally?
