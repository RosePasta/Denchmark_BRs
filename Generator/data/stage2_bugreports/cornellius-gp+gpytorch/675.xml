	<summary>[Bug] In grid creation?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Grid creation in the repo exceeds the grid bounds. Example: 


gpytorch/test/examples/test_grid_gp_regression.py


         Line 65
      in
      db889f1






 grid_bounds[i][0] - grid_diff, grid_bounds[i][1] + grid_diff, grid_size, device=device 




 and 


gpytorch/gpytorch/variational/grid_interpolation_variational_strategy.py


         Line 15
      in
      5411c90






 grid[:, i] = torch.linspace(grid_bounds[i][0] - grid_diff, grid_bounds[i][1] + grid_diff, grid_size) 





&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Copying the code from the test case, we have
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import torch
num_dim=1
grid_bounds = [(0, 1)] if num_dim == 1 else [(0, 1), (0, 2)]
grid_size = 25
grid = torch.zeros(grid_size, len(grid_bounds))
for i in range(len(grid_bounds)):
    grid_diff = float(grid_bounds[i][1] - grid_bounds[i][0]) / (grid_size - 2)
    grid[:, i] = torch.linspace(
        grid_bounds[i][0] - grid_diff, grid_bounds[i][1] + grid_diff, grid_size
    )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which returns the grid
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensor([[-0.0435],
        [ 0.0018],
        [ 0.0471],
        [ 0.0924],
        [ 0.1377],
        [ 0.1830],
        [ 0.2283],
        [ 0.2736],
        [ 0.3188],
        [ 0.3641],
        [ 0.4094],
        [ 0.4547],
        [ 0.5000],
        [ 0.5453],
        [ 0.5906],
        [ 0.6359],
        [ 0.6812],
        [ 0.7264],
        [ 0.7717],
        [ 0.8170],
        [ 0.8623],
        [ 0.9076],
        [ 0.9529],
        [ 0.9982],
        [ 1.0435]])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which clearly exceeds the grid_bounds.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I believe this should return a grid with all the points within the grid_bounds. This can be done by doing
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;torch.linspace(
        grid_bounds[i][0] - grid_diff, grid_bounds[i][1] + grid_diff, grid_size
    )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

or
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;torch.linspace(
        grid_bounds[i][0], grid_bounds[i][1], grid_size
    )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

instead.

		This is actually intentional: we extend grids two points past the specified boundary. The reason for this is that when doing e.g. cubic interpolation over a grid you get pretty bad behavior around the "actual" boundary. Doing things this way ensures that users can never supply data near the "actual" boundary.
