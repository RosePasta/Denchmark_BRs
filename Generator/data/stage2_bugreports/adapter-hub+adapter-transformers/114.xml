	<summary>Error on Installation</summary>
	<description>
!pip install git+https://github.com/adapter-hub/adapter-transformers.git -qq
Message:  ERROR: transformers 4.1.1 has requirement tokenizers==0.9.4, but you'll have tokenizers 0.9.3 which is incompatible.
Probably Transformers library got an update and causes the problem.

		Yes, this seems to be caused by a parallel transformers installation. The current version of adapter-transformers is based on transformers v3.5.1. Please try to uninstall the newer transformers version and re-install only adapter-transformers.
