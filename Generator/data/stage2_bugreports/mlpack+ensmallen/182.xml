&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Just Run The Ensmallen Test Suite
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The Test Should Pass.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40931412/76970507-01674000-6952-11ea-9041-6fbd0e5003ef.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I would like to work on this issue, if everyone is experiencing this.

		Often this is because we don't use enough iterations or use a to small step size. What we often do is uncomment:



ensmallen/tests/main.cpp


        Lines 20 to 27
      in
      3cb3827






 /** 



    * Uncomment these three lines if you want to test with different random seeds 



    * each run.  This is good for ensuring that a test's tolerance is sufficient 



    * across many different runs. 



  */ 



 //size_t seed = std::time(NULL); 



 //srand((unsigned int) seed); 



 //arma::arma_rng::set_seed(seed); 





and run the test for multiple iterations, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/922&gt;mlpack/mlpack#922&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does have some more information. Maybe you can do that and figure out how often the test fails?
