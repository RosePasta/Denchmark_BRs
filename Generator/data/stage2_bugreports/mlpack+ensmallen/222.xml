	<summary>HISTORY.md version update not included in the tag build</summary>
	<description>
Hi all,
I'm working on automating a PR based on an upstream change in 's codebase (c.f. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/coatless/rcppensmallen/pull/30&gt;coatless/rcppensmallen#30&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). One part that I noticed is the  made available under the release tag does not include the appropriate  version update.
For instance:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlpack/ensmallen/2.14.1/HISTORY.md&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlpack/ensmallen/2.14.1/HISTORY.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Gives:
### ensmallen ?.??.?: "???"

 * Fix release script (remove hardcoded information, trim leading whitespaces
   introduced by `wc -l` in MacOS)
    ([#216](https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/pull/216),
     [#220](https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/pull/220)).

 * Adjust tolerance for AugLagrangian convergence based on element type
   ([#217](https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/pull/217)).
Only in a later commit is the information passed on:

### ensmallen 2.14.1: "No Direction Home"
###### 2020-08-19
It's a minor inconvenience to substitute this in as unreleased version is kept; however, it would be nice for the .tar.gz associated with the release tag to have an up-to-date HISTORY.md file.

		Hmm, so the version date is not included outside of the HISTORY.md file.
Is there any chance to include a version date in ISO 8601 format within ens_version.hpp?

		Sure to both.  The lack of inclusion in the released .tar.gz probably has to do with a bug in the release scripts. I'll look into it...

 I didn't realize but the version information propagation into  is also broke. The tagged build shows 2.14.0 -- not v2.14.1.
Tagged version: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/blob/2.14.1/include/ensmallen_bits/ens_version.hpp#L15-L19&gt;https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/blob/2.14.1/include/ensmallen_bits/ens_version.hpp#L15-L19&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

#define ENS_VERSION_MAJOR 2
// The minor version is two digits so regular numerical comparisons of versions
// work right.  The first minor version of a release is always 10.
#define ENS_VERSION_MINOR 14
#define ENS_VERSION_PATCH 0
Later version:



ensmallen/include/ensmallen_bits/ens_version.hpp


        Lines 15 to 19
      in
      9d3fc45






 #define ENS_VERSION_MAJOR 2 



 // The minor version is two digits so regular numerical comparisons of versions 



 // work right.  The first minor version of a release is always 10. 



 #define ENS_VERSION_MINOR 14 



 #define ENS_VERSION_PATCH 1

		Exactly, the mlpack-bot release is using HEAD~2 when it should be using HEAD~1 for the tagged release.  This is because there is no merge commit when a rebase is done, so I miscounted by one.  Next release hopefully it should be fixed---sorry for the inconvenience!  I'll leave this issue open until we can prove that the release is right. :)

 Thanks for fixing it! From the 2.14.2 release, the version information and history.md entries have been resolved. 
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/compare/2.14.2...master&gt;2.14.2...master&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
