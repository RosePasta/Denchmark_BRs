	<summary>Release notes</summary>
	<description>
When pulling from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/blob/master/HISTORY.md&gt;HISTORY.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the release notes:

miss the "code name" that can be found in ensmallen.hpp and GitHub release page.
miss hard links to the PR, e.g. #86 -&gt; [#86](https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/pull/86)

Would it be possible to always include these components?

		Oh, I see, that's easy enough to do.  Let me manually make those changes now.  I don't think it's worth issuing 1.16.1 with just changes to HISTORY.md, but we can make sure that happens in the future.  Does that sound good?

		Sounds good! I agree, there is no need to release these history changes as 1.16.1.

		Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/ensmallen/pull/125&gt;#125&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  I'll make sure that HISTORY.md follows this format in the future.  To make your life easier, should we do this for mlpack also?

 I'm not sure how important that would be as the  bridge relies on the system-specific version of  installed whereas the  package  distributes the header-only library.
