	<summary>VCPKG Version Out of Date</summary>
	<description>
I installed ensmallen using vcpkg but discovered that the "upgraded" version is quite out of date.
vcpkg installs 2.11.2
Latest version is 2.14.2
I found this problem as I could not get my code to compile with EarlyStopAtMinLoss using a callback function. When I checked the header file there was no callback function constructor.
I manually changed the version number in my vcpkg CONTROL file but should this not be taken care of automatically with every new release?

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Blakjak88&gt;@Blakjak88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for the report.  I think this should be reported to the vcpkg repository, because we can't do too much about it here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For instance, here's the issue where someone originally requested ensmallen to be added to vcpkg: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/5015&gt;microsoft/vcpkg#5015&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I've asked them to bump the version of mlpack before; they're typically pretty responsive and helpful. üëç

		I reported it to VCPKG about a week ago. Not sure if it is updated yet.
