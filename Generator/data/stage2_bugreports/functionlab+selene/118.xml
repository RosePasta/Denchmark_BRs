	<summary>`get_predictions_for_bed_file` does not work if bed file has one entry</summary>
	<description>
Currently, if there is only one entry in a BED file, get_predictions_for_bed_file in model_predict.py will return without making any predictions. I think adjusting line 375 in model_predict.py as follows will probably fix it:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if  (batch_ids and i == 0) or i % self.batch_size != 0:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
