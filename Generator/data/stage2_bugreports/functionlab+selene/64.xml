	<summary>Add warning for variant effect prediction when ref base does not match reference genome</summary>
	<description>
We currently do not have error handling for the case where the ref base in a VCF file does not match the base at the specified position in the reference genome.
A user should be notified when this situation is observed. Selene should output a warning when at least 1 such case is detected. Furthermore, Selene should output predictions/scores for those variants into separate file(s) so that a user has the option of using those predictions if they wish but are also made aware that mismatches were observed for these variants.
Currently, Selene uses the ref base specified in the VCF file without checking against the reference sequence. When we implement the warning mentioned above, Selene will continue to use the ref base when outputting predictions but will specify in the warning message what the reference genome base was so that users can choose to correct their VCF and re-run Selene for those variants if it seems appropriate.
