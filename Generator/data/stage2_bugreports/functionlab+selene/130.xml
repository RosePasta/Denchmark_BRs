	<summary>Problem with `BASES_ARR` changes persisting between lua model and non-lua model predictions</summary>
	<description>
When loading a lua-trained model (i.e. published versions of DeepSEA and SeqWeaver), we have to update the bases one-hot encoding to match how these models were trained. If you subsequently load a Selene/PyTorch-trained model, the selene_sdk.sequences.Genome.BASES_ARR should be updated again to return to the original/correct encoding.
Currently, module needs to be explicitly reloaded to fix this issue.
