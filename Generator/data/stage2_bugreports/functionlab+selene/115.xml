	<summary>ReduceLROnPlateau in TrainModel uses incorrect mode</summary>
	<description>
Currently, the learning rate scheduler in TrainModel reduces LR when the maximum loss is not increased (see lines 373 and 419 in train_model.py). I assume this is a bug. My guess is that the scheduler used to track AUROC, but the mode was not switched from max to min when the scheduler was updated to track loss instead of AUROC.
