	<summary>`BASES_ARR` is initialized as a numpy array, but later changes to a Python list</summary>
	<description>
Causes some problems if using numpy specific functions -- the solution is probably to keep it consistent and initialize as a Python list.
Changes to Python list here:



selene/selene_sdk/sequences/genome.py


         Line 275
      in
      dbef3f5






 self.BASES_ARR = bases 








selene/selene_sdk/sequences/genome.py


         Line 285
      in
      dbef3f5






 cls.BASES_ARR = bases
