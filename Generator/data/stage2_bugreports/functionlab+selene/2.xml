	<summary>`is_positive` check in `proteus/sampler.py` should look at overlapping peaks for a feature</summary>
	<description>
In case there are multiple small peaks within the same region (it should be rare if it does happen - but we should probably consider it), probably should take the sum of the overlaps and evaluate whether the overlap exceeds the threshold in the end.
