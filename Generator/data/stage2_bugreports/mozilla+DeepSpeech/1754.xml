	<summary>import_cv error while creating common voice dataset</summary>
	<description>
OS Platform and Distribution (Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
I comfortably ran and created data-set from bin/import_ted.py
while running &gt;&gt; bin/import_cv.py ./cv/ from DeepSpeech directory, I am getting an error while importing cv-valid-train.csv.
No CSV file "/home/abhijeet/Desktop/dl_projects/DeepSpeech/cv/cv-valid-train.csv" - importing "/home/abhijeet/Desktop/dl_projects/DeepSpeech/cv/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-train.csv"...
Importing mp3 files...

Then I tried running this


soxi -s cv/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-train/sample-057655.wav
soxi FAIL formats: can't open input file `cv/cv_corpus_v1/cv-valid-train/sample-057655.wav': WAVE: RIFF header not found


Shall I remove this file and keep removing such files as they don't have headers? What am I missing here ?

I guess that should be how to deal with, and filing an issue against Common Voice project: this needs to be fixed upstream. Maybe the importer should be more tolerant and not die on those but report them as broken files?

 Is the corresponding mp3 file () existing?

 hey, there were around 12-15 such .mp3 files for which this error was there in cv-valid-train. All the .mp3 were successfully converted to .wav but their headers were not found.
Thanks.

 This is interesting. Could you run  on one of those wav files and share the output?

		Oh I am sorry, this was 2 weeks back and I deleted the downloaded corpus :-| . Started experimenting with voxforge instead. Still if you say, I will run importer of CV again and let you know.

		Closing for lack of activity and nothing actionable. New Common Voice releases should be imported with import_cv2.py anyway.
