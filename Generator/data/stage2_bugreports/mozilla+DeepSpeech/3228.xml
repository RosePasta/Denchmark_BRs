	<summary>TaskCluster-trigger bot</summary>
	<description>
We would need a bot (e.g., using &lt;denchmark-link:https://probot.github.io/docs/&gt;https://probot.github.io/docs/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) that would allow for reacting to the setting of some github label on PR submitted by contributors.
Upon ci:run-taskcluster (for example) on a PR that is reviewed and accepted, then the code would, with appropriate credentials:

git checkout the PR
git push it to trigger taskcluster

		Hi I am new to contributing to open source. Just to be clear what you are asking you want a probot bot to:

Upon a pull request being assigned a label do something automatically.
a) Is there a list of what you want to be done for every label, or do you just want a framework which can be added upon later?
The bot should be added to the probot website.

If that is it, then I can work on this.

Thanks for your interest!

Yes

a) Is there a list of what you want to be done for every label, or do you just want a framework which can be added upon later?

It's really only one use-case here, and my understanding after quickly looking at the probot doc is that it should be fairly easy relying on that stack to add new cases after

The bot should be added to the probot website.

I don't think so, why should we do that?
It should run on heroku under our control.

		Hi can you clarify what is meant by reviewed and accepted?
My first guess is that it means that all reviews have a state of "APPROVED", but I am not sure.
For now i have classified 'reviewed and accepted' to mean any PR which has &gt;= 2 reviews which have a state of "APPROVED" because listing all reviews includes reviews which have since been updated. (i.e. if someone initially requests changes, but then approves a PR, there will always be a review whose state is "CHANGES_REQUESTED"
I uploaded the bot's code to a repo &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RucksP/label-reactor&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes.

I'm not sure I understand what that means, often there is only going to be one person reviewing a PR.

listing all reviews includes reviews which have since been updated. (i.e. if someone initially requests changes, but then approves a PR, there will always be a review whose state is "CHANGES_REQUESTED"

I think we just care about the latest reviews from each of the reviewers ?
So if at time t all the reviewers set an "APPROVED" flag, then we can consider this is fine and proceed.

I uploaded the bot's code to a repo here

Thanks, I'll take a look!
