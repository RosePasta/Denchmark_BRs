Couple of problems with import swb


incorrect indentation on 171 means won't run


I didn't download the correct transcriptions as it wasn't obvious where I should put them. The importer then fails on line 100 once fixed as the folders have already been created.


No reason why these couldn't be downloaded automatically as they are freely available. Stolen from kaldi:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if [ ! -d swb_ms98_transcriptions ]; then
      echo " *** Downloading trascriptions and dictionary ***" 
      wget http://www.openslr.org/resources/5/switchboard_word_alignments.tar.gz ||
      wget http://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard/releases/switchboard_word_alignments.tar.gz
      tar -xf switchboard_word_alignments.tar.gz
    fi
  )
else
  echo "Directory with transcriptions exists, skipping downloading"
  [ -f $dir/swb_ms98_transcriptions ] \
    || ln -sf $SWBD_DIR/transcriptions/swb_ms98_transcriptions $dir/
fi
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Actually some of the points above have been in: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/commit/0d03bf6ddcc80eedd0039e52ae82aadda05e9680&gt;0d03bf6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I am not sure about what your dataset looks like (as it appears there are different versions) but mine just contains: swb1_d1, swb1_d2, swb1_d3, swb1_d4 and doc directories.
The main outstanding issue is that there's no advice on what structure to have (you have to infer and rely on trial and error). Made changes in PR

comment on the example expected structure
extract the swb1_LDC97S62.tgz (similarly to cv)
automatically download the transcripts via link above and extract them.
assert check paths exist

 Unfortunately these two data sets are not free. They are available for purchase from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/&gt;LDC&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for quite a bit of money.
