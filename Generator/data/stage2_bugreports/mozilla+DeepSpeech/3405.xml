		Adding a new Python version should, hopefully, /just/ be:

git grep "3\.8" taskcluster/: see where Python 3.8 is referenced,
update SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS to add new python version,
update maybe_numpy_min_version() to set min deps for numpy wheels for new python version,
update install_pyenv() to use newer pyenv that knows about the new python version
update pyenv URLs in taskcluster/.shared.yml (increment digit) to re-generate cache
add new .yml test files for new python version

		This is for the inference part only? Tensorflow 1.x isn't available for python 3.8 or 3.9

Yes, that's right.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dag7dev&gt;@dag7dev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for pushing the work, I have merged that to  and : when we do a 0.9.2 release, it will publish Python 3.9 packages. Let's see the feedback we get on 0.9.1 and if there are any bugfixes required or not.
