	<description>

With the current Dockerfile.train I had some issues with cudnn: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'CudnnRNNCanonicalToParams'
I could solve it with the following steps:

Use FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:20.03-tf1-py3 as new base image
Remove the three venv commands
Remove the --force-reinstall flag in DeepSpeech pip installation

I'm not quite sure if you need all of them, but now it's possible train from an existing checkpoint again. Maybe i find some time  in the next days to find out which statement was important.
