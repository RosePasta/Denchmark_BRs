	<summary>Expose Hot Words into binaries</summary>
	<description>
This is a follow-up of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/pull/3297&gt;#3297&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: new API entry points have been added and exposed in all bindings.
This bug is about replicating what has been done in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/pull/3297&gt;#3297&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for using this new API in the Python binary and do that in all our other binaries, as well as add CI testing:

 JavaScript (NodeJS, ElectronJS) #3361
 Java (APK app) #3393
 .Net #3416 #3461

Anyone willing to take care of that is welcome to ask more details, here or on Matrix. This is a good way to get into the project: it's technically easy but it touches several places as well as CI testing, so you get a nice overview of the surface.

I like to work on it? Is it available? @lissyx

Yes, you are welcome. I guess it'd be more efficient if you can join us on Matrix for helping you about the codebase!
