		FWIW I'm getting this error as well when trying to rebuild DeepSpeech from my docker scripts for 0.7.4
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/techiaith/docker-deepspeech-cy/blob/deepspeech-0.7.4/Makefile#L19&gt;https://github.com/techiaith/docker-deepspeech-cy/blob/deepspeech-0.7.4/Makefile#L19&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

it used to build! If I change to 0.8.2 or latest on master, the same bug appears.

		It's an issue at pypa setuptools...
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2353&gt;pypa/setuptools#2353&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Hopefully this doesn't require any changes or workarounds on DeepSpeech's side.

FWIW I'm getting this error as well when trying to rebuild DeepSpeech from my docker scripts for 0.7.4

Unfortunately, we can't upgrade this release. Also, forcing setuptools==50.0.0 get past this error for me, but the deepspeech_training package does not get installed, it seems.

		<comment id='4' author='lissyx' date='2020-08-31T19:39:41Z'>
		It builds successfully for me if you instead specify the last version of setuptools before today's 50.0.0 release:
RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip==20.0.2 wheel==0.34.2 setuptools==49.6.0

		<comment id='5' author='lissyx' date='2020-08-31T20:08:08Z'>
		Yeah there are a lot of reports of bad breakages because of 50.0.0. Unfortunately we wont be able to issue that kind of fix for older release so i prefer to wait and see for pypa/setuptools feedback on all those issues.

People report that SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib env var helps.

in the case of Docker, that would still need a change in the Dockerfile (you can't set and pass an environment variable in a docker build command) . So it's not a fix for older releases or even the current 0.8.2 stable release. For the next release, you might as well update the setuptools version number (?)

There's so much mess, I really don't get. Some of what seems to be one of the maintainer's  of the project seems to imply there is no bug here, but seeing how this explodes everywhere it looks suspicious.
As to the setuptools version, in my testing it was not enough.

		This really comes at a very bad time, we have so much to do that is equally important, I can't spare the time to try and debug pip/setuptools as well ...

		Great!
I got the 0.8.2 release to build and train models with the following workaround to use 49.6.3:


I take my own copy of Dockerfile.train.tmpl and update the setuptools version:  https://github.com/techiaith/docker-deepspeech-cy/blob/deepspeech-0.8.2/Dockerfile.train.tmpl#L44


Then copy into cloned DS and build: https://github.com/techiaith/docker-deepspeech-cy/blob/deepspeech-0.8.2/Makefile#L21


I could try and debug pip/setuptools the latest on master (?) if it's any help (although I'm no expert)

I got the 0.8.2 release to build and train models with the following workaround to use 49.6.3:

It seems to work here as well.
I'd welcome a PR against r0.8 and against master that:

bumps pip==20.2.2 version
bumps setuptools==49.6.0 version
updates the documentation as well

And we could make a 0.8.3 to release the fix as well.

No, it's really welcome, but if you can't do it I'll take care of it, no pressure here.
