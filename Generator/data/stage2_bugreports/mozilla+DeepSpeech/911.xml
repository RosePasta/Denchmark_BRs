	<summary>Support NodeJS 7.x, 8.x, 9.x for bindings</summary>
	<description>
Currently, building the bindings targetting NodeJS API above 6.x fails:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; ../deepspeech_wrap.cxx:966:23: error: 'WeakCallbackData' in namespace 'v8' does not name a type
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		There's a pending PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/swig/swig/pull/968&gt;swig/swig#968&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We could build our own SWIG but this is going to be some work (need to build for linux AND osx).

		After carefully looking at the above PR, it's all data file and not code to recompile ; thus, we can imagine "live-patching" after installing SWIG. It's nasty, but it works so far. The other alternative is the  module on NodeJS, with that documented example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nodejs/nan/blob/master/examples/async_pi_estimate/&gt;https://github.com/nodejs/nan/blob/master/examples/async_pi_estimate/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It requires writing wrapping code by hand, and nan is going to be replaced by something else rather soonish, but it is not yet ready (N-API). So maybe for the time being, we could live with the hack on top of SWIG.
