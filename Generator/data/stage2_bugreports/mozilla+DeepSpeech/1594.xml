	<summary>Intermittent test failure on prod models for NodeJS and Python</summary>
	<description>
Looking at retriggers failures on &lt;denchmark-link:https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/UgiKCb1TSYuMCy0waX5o-g&gt;https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/UgiKCb1TSYuMCy0waX5o-g&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it would looks like only NodeJS and Python prod are impacted.
C++, NodeJS and Python prod tests are all using the LM through the same run_prod_inference_tests function. Though, as much as I can tell, in all of the failures reported in the above link, it is when we test the inference on the 44kHz to 16kHz downsampling.
C++ links directly to libsox while NodeJS and Python more or less relies on stdout of sox binary. Maybe there is a slight variation and it triggers intermittence.
