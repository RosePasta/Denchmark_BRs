	<summary>File not found error when not providing a train_files parameter</summary>
	<description>
I have set --train False so it should not be looking for train_files or dev_files ? I am having to provide it a dummy file currently.

		To add to this- there is no way of telling if a checkpoint/model has been loaded for test mode. Unless I am missing something.

		Yeah I had to workaround this for some local tests but ended up just passing data/ldc93s1/ldc93s1.csv for train/validation files. Supporting empty lists requires a surprisingly large amount of modifications.

		That's exactly what I did. I don't believe that supporting empty lists is in order. With --train False you should bypass any training and therefore train csv reading all together.
