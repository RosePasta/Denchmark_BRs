	<summary>pcm_to_np : audio_format and segment_buffer must be swapped!</summary>
	<description>
Hello everyone!
While trying to transcribe a file, I realized that in the training/deepspeech_training/util/feeding.py there's an error on the line:
samples = pcm_to_np(audio_format, segment_buffer)
It must be actually opposite order:
samples = pcm_to_np(segment_buffer, audio_format)
according to the function description on training/deepspeech_training/util/audio.py
Otherwise it causes an error like "bytes has no attribute channels" or so
