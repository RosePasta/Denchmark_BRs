	<summary>ERROR: AlignOutput: Can't determine stream position creating Scorer</summary>
	<description>

Have I written custom code (as opposed to running examples on an unmodified clone of the repository): Yes, to remove the prune but is not working with pruning
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (our builds, or upstream TensorFlow): default install of the deepspeech package

ERROR: AlignOutput: Can't determine stream position
ERROR: Could not align file during write after header

this error is not from kenlm, it's from openfst code

--top_k 9000000

can you verify with much less data?
What are your hardware specs here?

Spanish and English text.

Where are those data from ? Can you repro with documented LM steps and git-provided data sources for the LM?

What are your hardware specs here?

Ryzen 9 3900x
32 GB RAM
8TB storage, host disk and project disk with more than 120GB free space each

Where are those data from ?

Spanish from a private source, English: &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.openslr.org/resources/11/librispeech-lm-norm.txt.gz&gt;http://www.openslr.org/resources/11/librispeech-lm-norm.txt.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes, with the English norm text from libri of the guide.

		lm and trie

Which old method?

lm.binary and trie as separate files

Can you verify if out/lm.binary was properly generated? Maybe issue is here

Looks correct with 1.7GB, let me test if I can still generate the trie out of it.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./generate_trie alphabet.txt  lm.binary trie
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'lm::FormatLoadException'
  what():  native_client/kenlm/lm/model.cc:70 in lm::ngram::detail::GenericModel&lt;Search, VocabularyT&gt;::GenericModel(const char*, const lm::ngram::Config&amp;) [with Search = lm::ngram::trie::TrieSearch&lt;lm::ngram::SeparatelyQuantize, lm::ngram::trie::ArrayBhiksha&gt;; VocabularyT = lm::ngram::SortedVocabulary] threw FormatLoadException because `new_config.enumerate_vocab &amp;&amp; !parameters.fixed.has_vocabulary'.
The decoder requested all the vocabulary strings, but this binary file does not have them.  You may need to rebuild the binary file with an updated version of build_binary.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Throws an error but I think it is just my old generate_trie. Hmm no idea honestly

An old client can load the lm.binary without issues

Any specificity regarding the filesystem? rights? tellp() to fail on an output stream is weird ...

No.

rights?

double-checked and folder and files got write read permissions.

@carlfm01 Could you catch the actual error value returned by tellp() ?

Yes:
Finally re-compiled the decoder
tellp returns -1, reading the docs I should read the state, will try

--package pack/

I was so simple, looks like at some point lost the full path, and was only taking the dir path.
Now it works with --package pack/lm.scorer

		Yeah we should be checking errors more carefully in save_dictionary. Basically check errors when opening the fstream and writing to it before we get to ConstFst::Write in the first place.

 Could you test the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/pull/3066&gt;#3066&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ? I'd like to make sure it is able to catch your error, but I suspect for proper fix we'd like to change the prototype of  and make it return a bool to know whether it could write.

@carlfm01 Could you test the PR #3066 ?

It did not print the error messages, the "lissyx  version" just to make sure is actually applying the change.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Looks like a character based model.
Using detected UTF-8 mode: True

taking the dir path.

I think to avoid my error it just needs to test if it is a directory and throw a message if the directory exists, like "please don't use a valid  directory as a name for the output scorer".
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lissyx&gt;@lissyx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I think your solution will work for the cases when there's no permission, issues with storage(like the user with network storage), full disk etc.

well, according to the doc, .bad() should also work, but maybe it is legit to open a directory as a stream?

Yes, I confirm it shows the error with a directory  as output:

Error opening 'pack/'
Error when creating pack/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
