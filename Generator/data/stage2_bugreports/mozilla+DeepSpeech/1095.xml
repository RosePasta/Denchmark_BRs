		We'll just have a trigger a new build once &lt;denchmark-link:https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-group-inspector/#/Cl-jCpbdSxacYZjblrnEgQ&gt;https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-group-inspector/#/Cl-jCpbdSxacYZjblrnEgQ&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is green.

		Hello,
I am trying to infer a custom trained model with native client in a Asus Thinkerboard, a card similar to raspberry with 32bit armv7l architecture.
I tried to compile from scratch, including tensorflow, but ended up with the same error than this issue is reporting (the SparseToDense one).
Then I tried your raspberry-ready compiled libraries downloaded from:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://queue.taskcluster.net/v1/task/Wnpx0NPjS3G20t76jbl15Q/runs/0/artifacts/public/native_client.tar.xz&gt;https://queue.taskcluster.net/v1/task/Wnpx0NPjS3G20t76jbl15Q/runs/0/artifacts/public/native_client.tar.xz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But unfortunately this new "Illegal instruction" error showed up:
Thread 1 "deepspeech" received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
0xb692de84 in tensorflow::(anonymous namespace)::GraphConstructor::TryImport() () from /home/ftx/fonotexto/herramientas/DeepSpeech/nativelibs_jmd/libdeepspeech.so
(NOTE: in my raspberry pi3 these libraries work fine).
So I would like to do a specific compilation for the Thinkerboard card, could you give me any hint to do that and skip the SparseToDense error?
Thanks in advance,
Mar

 Right, building yourself is the proper solution, but you need to document what you did. If you rebuilt yourself the proper way, you should not have had the  issue. Besides, can we have this discussion on Discoures &lt;denchmark-link:https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/deep-speech&gt;https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/deep-speech&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ? We want to use issues only for bugs / features.

		Hi,

Thanks for the quick response, yes I have added a comment at discourse.mozilla.org, sorry for the inconvenience, you can discard the post at github.

I will send you an email with the steps I followed ¿or shoud I post them at the forum?.

Thanks again,

Mar
