		This is failing, as there were no CSV files specified for train and dev. At the moment all three sets are always mandatory - even if not using all of them.

		hello,when i process the data,with command : bin/import_cv.py path/to/target/directory, i create a target directory,i put my have downloaded data in it,and i have install the sox  but the result is:
sh: 1: sox: not found
SoX could not be found!
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;If you do not have SoX, proceed here:
 - - - http://sox.sourceforge.net/ - - -

If you do (or think that you should) have SoX, double-check your
path variables.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Nobody is working on it AFAIK. Feel free to work on it! If you have any questions you can ask here or over on our IRC channel, #machinelearning at irc.mozilla.org: &lt;denchmark-link:https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This was fixed at some point. Now if you don't specify train set, no training will be done. Same idea for dev and test sets.
