	<summary>Pypi Readme doesn't render well</summary>
	<description>
As pointed out by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/szha&gt;@szha&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/204&gt;#204&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 our Readme &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gluonnlp&gt;does not render well on Pypi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 due to relative links in the Readme.
In particular there are        ,  links at the top of the Readme, linking to the second half of the document.
Should we remove the relative links? As the document is not too long I wonder if having these links is worth having the Pypi Readme not being rendered properly.
