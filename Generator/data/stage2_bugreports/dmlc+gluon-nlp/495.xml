	<summary>[BERT] BERTModel output cannot be used for mask language modeling</summary>
	<description>
Currently the BERTModel can be created with decoder for the masked language model task. However, by default the API does not handle decoding arbitrary masking position. I have a fix locally and will PR it soon.
