	<summary>Remove mutable_args restriction in get_model API</summary>
	<description>
I think we can remove the check of mutable_args in the get_model API for BERT, GPT, Language model and transformer. We can introduce a separate flag "allow_override" if users want to override any configuration. Otherwise overriding any configuration is forbidden.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin&gt;@eric-haibin-lin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
just to clarify:
currently the mutable_args of for example the BERT model are ['use_residual', 'dropout', 'embed_dropout', 'word_embed']. Non mutable arguments of the bert_12_768_12 model are for example 'hidden_size', 'num_heads' or 'num_layers' (from looking at bert_12_768_12_hparams in model/bert.py). The goal of this fix is to allow calling nlp.model.get_model for example as follows:

So instead of allowing the user to modify only the parameters in mutable_args, we allow the user to modify any parameter in bert_12_768_12_hparams as long as they pass in the parameter "allow_override=True" along with it. Is this correct?

 I created a PR for this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/1207&gt;#1207&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I asked a question in that PR. Also found the Jenkins test to be failing for what seems to be unrelated to the codechange. Would appreciate any feedback to get started with this codebase. Thanks!
