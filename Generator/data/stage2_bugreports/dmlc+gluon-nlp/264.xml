	<summary>apply_weight_drop required changes to integrate mxnet 1.3</summary>
	<description>
our existing implementation on apply_weight_drop relied on a non-public attribute in gluon RNN blocks that were removed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11482&gt;apache/incubator-mxnet#11482&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 when making the RNN blocks hybrid, and it does not have test, which will prevent us from integrating with mxnet 1.3. We need:

 fix apply_weight_drop and upgrade the mxnet dependency to allow 1.3 integration.
 add test for apply_weight_drop
 bump up minor version to 0.4 which relies on 1.3.
