	<summary>Self-attentive Sentence Embedding Tutorial Undeclared Dependency (sklearn)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

self-attentive sentence embedding tutorial is using sklearn for accuracy and f1. As we didn't take sklearn as a dependency, we should migrate those usage to the accuracy/f1 in mxnet and drop the dependency in docker

I have the code ready with sklearn accuracy metric changed to mxnet accuracy metric. However, mxnet F1 currently supports binary classification. However, this tutorial is a multi-class classification and hence will not be able to use mxnet F1 metric. Should I submit PR only with accuracy changed or leave it as it is??

 you may be interested in the mxnet metrics improvements for mxnet 2: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18083&gt;apache/incubator-mxnet#18083&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you have the code ready, it's good to submit the part that can be supported by mxnet metric
