	<description>
The py2 detection in CI seems to be unstable, and several times in the detection of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/526&gt;#526&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, py2 unexpectedly failed. But after using empty commit to re-trigger it, py2 passed.

The same problem was occasionally encountered in previous PR.

		We recently added a CPU node to the CI, and because we didn't specify the node type in our jenkins file, that CPU-only node was being used, which caused the rendering of notebooks to fail as they require GPU. This surfaced as "pygment lexer not known error" due to not failing fast in makefile.

		Since the problem is not occurring, I will track the rest of the progress on speeding up the CI and making it robust in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/302&gt;#302&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
