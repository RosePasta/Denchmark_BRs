	<summary>Autobuild fails with Pygments lexer name '{.python .input}' is not known</summary>
	<description>
Sometimes during autobuild the build fails on the target html with a message Pygments lexer name '{.python .input}' is not known.
Last time I have it when working on BERT, and the failure happened in a totally unrelated tutorial: . Here is the pipeline: &lt;denchmark-link:http://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/gluon-nlp/detail/PR-548/5/pipeline/&gt;http://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/gluon-nlp/detail/PR-548/5/pipeline/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Forcing build helps to fix that, but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin&gt;@eric-haibin-lin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned that this issue happens from time to time, and it would be nice to find the root cause of it.

		It usually happens when there are other failures, and it seems to be the case here too &lt;denchmark-link:http://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/gluon-nlp/detail/PR-548/5/pipeline/#step-44-log-1531&gt;http://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/gluon-nlp/detail/PR-548/5/pipeline/#step-44-log-1531&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What might be happening is that when rendering of a notebook failed, the make process skips the execution of the rest of the notebooks, and continues to the next sphinx build step. This results in sphinx trying to render notebooks that haven't been run.

		I will try to make it fail fast and give informative errors.
