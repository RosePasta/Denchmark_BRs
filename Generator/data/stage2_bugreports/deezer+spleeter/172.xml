		It's weird. This ran fine for me a couple of weeks ago but this whole D: drive mess is coming back to haunt me.  I stopped doing PIP because it was not completing now that I'm coming back to the original method (which used to work before I abandoned it because I was running into the other reported D: issue), I'm running into this again.  If I'm desperate I could rename my drives but it just strikes me as weird.  If we could know which file to change the directory ourselves that could help.... or just point to the same directory we're running these scripts on by default...
