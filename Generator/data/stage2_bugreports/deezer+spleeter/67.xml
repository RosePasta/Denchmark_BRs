	<summary>[Bug] Typo In README</summary>
	<description>
Under Quick start subheading there is a typo in git clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter. Instead of the capital D, it should be small d.
git clone https://github.com/deezer/spleeter -- this is the correct link
Fixing this will allow anyone to clone the repository effortlessly.

		Hi Rohit.
Both urls are valid (capital of lowercase d) do you have an example configuration where it does make a difference ?

		Hello Mmoussallam,
If you try to git clone with the capital D in the link, it will not download and throw an error.

		As seen in associated PR not considering this at the moment. Closing.
