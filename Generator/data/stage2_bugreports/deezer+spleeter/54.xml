I used pip to install pip install spleeter -i &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.doubanio.com/simple%60&gt;https://pypi.doubanio.com/simple`&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And I have to use the doubanio mirror because I am in China
But I have successfully installed spleeter:
However! I cannot use it. It always tells me 'system cant find this file '. I am pretty sure that the file path is correct.
After many trials, I still don't know why. Can anybody give me some suggesstions please?
Thanks

"系统找不到指定的文件"means that 'ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND  System can't find the file specificed.'

&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html&gt;https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
