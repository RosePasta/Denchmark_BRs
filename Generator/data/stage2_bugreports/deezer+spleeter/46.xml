		I solved this error by changing my command line from
spleeter separate -i audio_example.mp3 -o audio_output -p spleeter:5stems
to
spleeter separate -i spleeter/audio_example.mp3 -p spleeter:5stems -o output

		Impossible to activate conda env with powershell. Finally working with Git bash but I've got the same error :
INFO:spleeter:Loading audio b'spleeter/audio_example.mp3' from 0.0 to 600.0

How to read errors, is there a log file ?

		I'm getting this as well.
Trying the command line posted earlier gave me the same error, and I've confirmed ffmpeg version 4.2 is installed. I'll see about updating it.
EDIT: audio data loaded successfully after changing input file path to full path

The path to your audio file is not valid.

		Same issues - reinstalling ffmpeg did not help, and I could not also find a way to see the logs.
Help me Obywan ;)

		I managed to resolve this issue by installing ffmpeg using Homebrew.

brew install ffmpeg
cd in to my spleeter folder and ran the command spleeter separate -i test.mp3 -o audio_output
