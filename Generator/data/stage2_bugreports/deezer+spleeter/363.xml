	<summary>[Bug] Spleeter has no output if filename ends with space</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It seems that if the filename you are trying to split ends with a space, it won't save any results
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;// Notice the space before .mp3
python -m spleeter separate -i "path/to/foo .mp3" -p spleeter:2stems-16kHz -o "path/to/result-dir"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Exits without error but has no files in the output dir.
The folder created by spleeter is there, eg foo but without trailing space.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;










OS
Windows


Installation type
Conda

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Christilut&gt;@Christilut&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Ending a filename with a space seems like a particularly evil thing to do :)
That being said the path in your example is not valid in windows, did you try with a correct one ?

		Yeah, I'm using spleeter in my app with a GUI and normally everything works but files ending with a space don't work.
But my workaround for Windows is now that I'm copying the source file into a fixed filename and then work with that.
