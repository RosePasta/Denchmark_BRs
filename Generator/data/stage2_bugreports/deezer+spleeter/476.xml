	<summary>[Bug] High-pitched artifact at very beginning of separated track (v1.5.4)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Install latest Spleeter version (1.5.4):  pip install spleeter
Run following Python script to separate 'other' component of bluesky.mp3:

from spleeter import *
from spleeter.utils import *
from spleeter.audio.adapter import get_default_audio_adapter
from spleeter.separator import Separator

separator = Separator('spleeter:4stems', stft_backend='librosa', multiprocess=False)
audio_adapter = get_default_audio_adapter()
waveform, _ = audio_adapter.load('bluesky.mp3', sample_rate=44100)
prediction = separator.separate(waveform)
out = prediction['other']

audio_adapter.save('/path/to/output.mp3', out, 44100, 'mp3', '256k')
There's a high-pitched artifact at the very beginning of the output track.
The problem only occurs when you set the stft_backend to librosa.
I attached a ZIP including the input and output files: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/files/5093723/tracks.zip&gt;tracks.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I initially thought &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/pull/426&gt;#426&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was supposed to fix this, but I'm already on v1.5.4 and it's still happening.

 Any idea why this may be happening? Is it related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/pull/426&gt;#426&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JeffreyCA&gt;@JeffreyCA&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Indeed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/pull/426&gt;#426&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is supposed to fix this issue, but it was merged after the release of  so it is not included in . We'll include the fix in a new release shortly. In the meantime, you can install spleeter from sources and get the fix:
git clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter
cd spleeter
pip install .

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JeffreyCA&gt;@JeffreyCA&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Version 2 has been released and it should have solved this. Let us know if you still encounter the issue.
