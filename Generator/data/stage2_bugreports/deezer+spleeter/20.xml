		I read the faq and tried to run with a duration of 1 ( -d 1) second but still have same issue.  Didnt mean to originally call it a bug , is probably something to do with my installation. I dont know much about git or python.
I have an i7 processor and 12 gb ram.
I really excited to try this so any help is much appreciated!
