	<summary>[Bug] Crashes Windows 10 completely</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running the script with "2stems" it works, but with "4stems" it does crash everything, so need to hard reset the pc. (Windows 10 64-bit), I don't know how to get a crash report for powershell cause I don't get one, it just crashes after a minute or two after starting the script.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm using this script:
python -m spleeter separate -i test.mp3 -p spleeter:4stems -o output
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Powershell (even tried with Commandprompt and it does do the same crash), it does not say anything.
None
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;










OS
Windows


Installation type
Python / pip / Conda / other


RAM available
8.0 GB (6,94 to use)


Hardware spec
AMD A10-7800 Radeon R7, Compute Core 4C+8GB, 3,50Ghz



&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Don't know if it might be memory problem or processor? Is there a "low memory"-mode that could be used?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/starinspace&gt;@starinspace&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is unfortunate and quite hard to understand for us, no other complete crash were reported so far. you may want to use the docker version instead of conda: check out in the wiki how to use it.

		The same thing happened to me, but i don't opened a bug report.
At first spleeter worked perfectly, but after updating with the files from the last update, this problem started. Every time I try to use 4stems script, my computer starts to consume the whole 8GB ram, making my computer to stop working completely. The only option is to disconnect from the plug to restart. :(
So far I am happy with the result of 2stems with 22k, but it's sad i cant use the 4stems anymore.

Just so you know we have started working on an update that should greatly reduce the amount of RAM consumed by spleeter when running the separate command. I'll keep you posted
