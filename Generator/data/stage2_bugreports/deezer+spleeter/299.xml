	<summary>Unable to convert into 4 stems and 5 stems after the failure in downloading the libraries for the first time</summary>
	<description>
I tried converting an audio file into 4 stems and 5 stems for the first time. 2 stems works fine. The problem is while I was trying to convert into 4 stems and 5 stems for the first time. My internet dropped down and was unable to download the required libraries of the same. After that while I try to use 4 stems/5 stems as an option it throws me this error. I see that the pretrained models failed due to the absence of the required librarires(4 stems and 5 stems). Could you please help me with the steps to reinstall the 4 stems and 5 stems libraries and unblock me? Thanks.
Seems like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/189&gt;this issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is reported earlier. Which FAQ you meant &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mmoussallam&gt;@mmoussallam&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ? Can you please share the link?
I couldn't find the solution :(

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/imkikus&gt;@imkikus&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , you'll need to clean the \pretrained_models` directory this will force a re-download of the models. Check the FAQ for more details.
