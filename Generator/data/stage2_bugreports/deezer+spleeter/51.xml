	<summary>[Bug] Command not found</summary>
	<description>
I'm sure this is a user error as I am new to coding but when I try to use I get "command not found". Does this mean it wasn't installed properly?
I installed miniconda for this.

Thanks for the help!

		Can you try running
python -m spleeter separate -h ?
If that doesn't work, you probablyy need to go through &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation&gt;the installation docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 again.

		My problem turned out to be that I didn't have Anaconda installed I only installed Miniconda, once I installed Anaconda it worked. Thank you!

		Re installing worked though now I am running into the ffprobe error. I reinstalled using homebrew. Still no luck. Should I just wait till next release?
