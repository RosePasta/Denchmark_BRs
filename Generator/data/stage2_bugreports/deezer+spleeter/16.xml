	<summary>setuptools package version requirement during installation</summary>
	<description>
I got the following error when I was installing spleeter via pip. I didn't had setuptools installed on my system previously. Just to let you know.
ERROR: tensorboard 1.14.0 has requirement setuptools&gt;=41.0.0, but you'll have setuptools 40.8.0 which is incompatible.

		In general, the command to update setuptools would be pip install -U setuptools. Use pip3 if that's what you use.

 macOS Mojave 10.14.6 &amp; Python 3.7.4
I ran "pip3 install spleeter"
Probably it'll be ok when I update the setuptools package explicitly. I wanted to notify developers to update the "requirments.txt" file accordingly so that it would install the newer versions of the setuptools package during initial install.

		You should then try
pip install -U setuptools
as suggested by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aadibajpai&gt;@aadibajpai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or
pip3 install setuptools&gt;=41.0.0
We will update PyPi package to reflect the setuptools dep explicitly

Since it's a subdependency if you start going down this rabbit hole then it might be too deep :P
Imho the error message is self explanatory :)

		Well actually we are using setuptools in Spleeter installation script so it still make sense :)
