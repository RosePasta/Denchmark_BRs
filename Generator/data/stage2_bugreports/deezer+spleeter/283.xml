	<summary>[Bug] spleeter seperating my own mp3 failure by using docker image</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

spleeter failed to seperate my own mp3 which is stored in the directory as docker's input volume
running the default command was successful: docker run -v $(pwd)/output:/output researchdeezer/spleeter separate -i audio_example.mp3 -o /output
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Installed using spleeter docker image on win7
Run as docker run -v $(pwd)/input:/input -v $(pwd)/output:/output -v $(pwd)/model:/model -e MODEL_PATH=/model researchdeezer/spleeter separate -i /input/song1.mp3 -o /output
Got terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc error

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Share what your terminal says when you run the script (as well as what you would expect).

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tonywk&gt;@tonywk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

how big is your mp3 file exactly ? 2G RAM in your virtual machine might be too low to operate on a large one.

		My mp3 is about 5M, not big..

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tonywk&gt;@tonywk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We've made some tests, and 2Gb for a full 5M file will not be sufficient. Try to split your file in smaller pieces.
