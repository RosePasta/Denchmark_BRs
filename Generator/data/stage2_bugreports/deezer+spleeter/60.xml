I followed through with installing spleeter-gpu and when i try to run it this is the ouput I get.

		I'm not a dev here, but this looks like the kind of error you might get if you didn't have the right CUDA/cuDNN installed for TF 1.14.

		Interesting, I used their yml file to install the environment but I'll look into that now, I'll try running spleeter on my dev environment and post what I get

		Sound like a Cuda installation issues. Closing.
We will soon provide a ready to use GPU version from conda forge.

 I've looked around, and I might have missed it, but is the GPU version of spleeter ready from conda forge yet?

		Never mind. I still haven't figured out why I can't GPU split.

		<comment id='6' author='swissbeats93' date='2019-12-04T15:31:04Z'>
		I used pip. Something like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
pandas==0.25.1
requests
pip
museval==0.3.0
musdb==0.3.1
norbert==0.2.1
spleeter
ffmpeg-python
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Make sure you already have python 3.7 and ffmpeg installed

 are those pip commands? How do I apply those things to my system?

		Write them to a text file (requirements.txt) and then do a pip install - r
requirements.txt

I'll try creating a conda yaml and see how it goes
&lt;denchmark-link:#&gt;…&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		TF 1.14 aligns with CUDA 10.0, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#linux&gt;this page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu&gt;Here's more information about installing TF&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
You can build TF from source if you want to (first link) and use alternative CUDA versions.
However, If I were you, I'd purge CUDA and install version 10.0, which is appropriate for TF (first link) &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/&gt;as well as Pytorch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I did the Cuda 10.0 installation for those reasons but it was after I had already set up 10.1, everything else works on my system except for when I test spleeter-gpu. I'll try testing spleeter on my development environment and see if it works

Installed TF 1.14 from Conda shell using the following instrunction:  https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu
