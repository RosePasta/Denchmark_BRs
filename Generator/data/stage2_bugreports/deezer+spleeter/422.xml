	<summary>[Bug] Broken links on the models wiki page</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The links to the base_config.json files for the pretrained models on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/3.-Models&gt;this wiki page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are broken. They link to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/configs/2stems/base_config.json&gt;wiki pages&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that no longer exist. Took me a sec to find the real ones, but I believe those links could just be updated to point to the files &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/tree/master/spleeter/resources&gt;in this directory.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Below that there's also a link to the releases on "github.deezerdev.com", which I assume should be update as well.  (though that one was less confusing)
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Visit the models wiki page
Try to click the link to see a working example of a model json config.
Observe the confusing redirect to the wiki home page and weird permission warning from Github
