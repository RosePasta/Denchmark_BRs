	<summary>[Bug] CondaVerificationError on some Windows installations</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm unable to install Spleeter on some Windows 10 installations and they all give CondaVerificationErrors
This happens on a HyperV Virtual Machine and on my XPS13 ultrabook.
I can't really make much sense of the error. The files in the errors do exist.
The only thing I can think of is that both the VM and the older ultrabook are missing some critical CPU features?
I've installed it successfully on a more recent Windows 10 with Nvidia card.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Installed using conda install -c conda-forge spleeter
Run as user
Installation proceeds as normal but verification steps fails

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Turns out this is because I'm doing a silent installation but did not have the PATH set for conda, resulting in an SSL error reported &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/8273&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
That broke the conda installation and any spleeter installation attempts after the first attempt result in the error in this issue. Fun!
