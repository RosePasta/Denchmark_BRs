		Also ran into this issue. Tried to remove the package and reinstall but same problem. I installed in addition to the normal package the spleeter-gpu as well to test and some spleeter commands seemed to work but of course it was looking for the CUDA driver. Seems like the main package is just missing a file.

		Hi everyone, this seems to be an issue of anaconda execution priviledge. Possibly you have installed Anaconda for administrator only (not ALL users).
People in this&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57339230/unable-to-create-process-using-c-bld-scrapy-1564674375870-h-env-python-exe&gt; stackoverflow thread &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 have  successfully overcome  this using either:
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Method 1&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

force reinstall of the package using pip:
pip install --force-reinstall spleeter
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Method 2&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

erase and reinstall Anaconda:

Use Add/Remove program to uninstall Anaconda
Install Anaconda again and make sure to select "Install for all users" during process.

Hope this helps

		This doesn't appear to help. Like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/psylion&gt;@psylion&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I have nothing in my "D:" drive (in fact it's an optical drive) so I don't understand why it's looking there at all.

		Hm yeah. After uninstall/reinstall of miniconda and spleeter same issues. No folder in D:\ either as noted above. Reinstalled and made sure installed for all users. Prompt ran as admin.

		I could install it now, but I get an error at runtime about failing to load the TensorFlow lib (despite it was installed successfully).
I installed Python 3.7.5, installed spleeter using pip from an administrator shell.

		I had the same error, i solved it by running:
python -m spleeter separate
Instead of :
spleeter separate

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/classikd&gt;@classikd&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 solution worked just fine from within the Anaconda Prompt.

		After several attempts using conda, miniconda, and pip with various kinds of errors. pip --force-reinstall finally got it working,
I'm curious...can this be released as a command-line Windows exe in the future? Or do the number of deps make this difficult to package? (I don't do a lot of python, so forgive me.)

		Same problem here when using miniconda installed for all users. Where does the "D:\blb..." stuff come from? It seems to occur on all installations with the problem, and it definitely has nothing to do with my computer. D: is the optical drive. It has to be hardcoded in some source or binary somewhere.
