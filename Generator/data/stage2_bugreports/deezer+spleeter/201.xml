	<summary>.bat file will not run for the 11khz filter off</summary>
	<description>
I  edited all the Stems files under the  configs file edited to "mask_extension":"average" &amp; can get the 11khz filter turned off when manually running the file but when trying to make a drag &amp; drop over a .bat shortcut, I always get the stems with the 11khz filter on.  How can this be fixed please?
I get the error -- Configuration file spleeter/configs/4stems/base_config11.json  not found even though I created a file (base_config11.json with "mask_extension":"average") with that name &amp; instructions in the same place as the original "base_config.json". I even tried editing the original "base_config.json" with "mask_extension":"average" but when I run it from a ,bat, it always runs with the 11khz filter on.
Thanks, Roger
