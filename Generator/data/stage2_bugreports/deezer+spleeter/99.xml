	<summary>[Bug] Update library to stop using deprecated dependencies</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running the 2stem model I get a lot of deprecation errors from tensorflow and numpy.
Please update the used APIs to follow the dependencies new APIs.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Running on Ubuntu 18.04.1
Installed using pip3
Run the following script

from spleeter.separator import Separator

separator = Separator('spleeter:2stems')
separator.separate_to_file('./some-song,mp3', './out')

I get the following deprecation messages
