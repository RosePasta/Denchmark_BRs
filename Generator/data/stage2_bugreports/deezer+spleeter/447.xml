		Yes, we recently moved our CI from CircleCI to Github action and we removed the requirements.txt file during the process, leaving the dependency listing into the setup.py. We will maybe restore requirements later and integrate it directly into the packaging. Feel free to submit a pull request if you need it quickly :)
