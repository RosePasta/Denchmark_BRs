	<summary>[Bug] Cannot create a file when that file already exists</summary>
	<description>
I am running spleeter in powershel and can do the 2 split fine using,
spleeter separate -i mytune.mp3 -o myfoldername
But when i try the 4 split using,
spleeter separate -i doishort.wav -o tingaling -p spleeter:4stems
I get an error. I made sure tingaling was a brand new folder before running.

		Getting the same error using 2stems. Output folder permissions changed to be writable before running spleeter.

		I get the same error as well.  I tried renaming, moving folders out and all of these things but I get the same error running PIP.  I only started doing PIP because the other method was giving me that D: drive issue.  I can run the same file many times in a row and sometimes it will give me some stems or nothing at all.

		I tried the following:
Create the folder (I assume you are using windows), then right click and select properties.
Under General tab, at the end there is an 'Atributes' section, usually Read-only is 'selected', just blank it and Apply/Save changes.
Then run your console As Admin and run spleeter.
This worked for me,remember to check always the Attributes section of the folder before running spleeter.

		Hi keliethn, yes that worked for me thanks for your help!
What I am noticing in Windows 10 is when I go to file properties, attributes, untick read only and click apply it makes the changes. If I go out of the folder and back in again windows has changed the folder back to read only. Not sure why its doing this. A quick browse shows other people have the same problem and it could be permissions related.
Is it possible for spleeter to be updated so when the folder is created the read only attribute is not ticked?
First time ive got anything off github working and first time playing with an AI algo so feeling quite chuffed right now.

		Closing this because it's a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/163&gt;#163&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
