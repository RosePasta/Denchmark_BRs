hi, sorry for my bad English I'm French
My issue : Terminal says : No such file or directory
I've read somewhere that "be sure to be in the spleeter folder if you are using cloned repository or replace audio_example.mp3 by a valid path to an audio file)", but I can't find where is the spleeter folder
Many thanks in advance !
