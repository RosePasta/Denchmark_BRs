		It looks like a silent fail linked to a out of memory condition.
You can try monitoring memory usage using docker stat. Check whether the container reaches the memory limit at some point. If it does, it will probably fail. Then a workaround would be to:

reduce the duration of the processed file using the -d option of spleeter separate (reducing file duration will require less memory).
and/or:
increase the memory limit in the docker preferences.

Let us know, if OOM may explain your issue.

increase the memory limit in the docker preferences.

üëç That worked for me. Increased Docker's memory to 8GB and re-ran the command and it output the stems.
docker stats reported that it consumed almost 6GB of that memory to process the 9.5MB audio file.
And the resulting stems files were each 42MB.

		I could run spleeter by increase Docker's memory, too.
Thank youüéâ
