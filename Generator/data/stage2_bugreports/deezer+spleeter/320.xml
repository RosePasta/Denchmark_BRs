Description
I was using SPYDER to use SPLITTER. But being new to programming field, I dont have much Idea on how to use splitter in SPYDER (single page code may be). That is why I tried colab and it worked perfect. But when I tried copy pasting the code from COLAB, I encountered an error.
Step to reproduce
Earlier I tried cloning git, conda install, But as i am new I do not know what it does as I was already having ANACOND NAVIGATOR
then
simply copy pasted the codes from
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/github/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter.ipynb#scrollTo=afbcUSken16L&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter.ipynb#scrollTo=afbcUSken16L&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

to my jupyter
Output
spleeter separate -i spleeter/audio_example.mp3 -p spleeter:2stems -o output
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Environment

installed spleeter by code "pip install spleeter"
and after running this "pip install ffmpeg"

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/viveklal987&gt;@viveklal987&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

the command spleeter separate -i spleeter/audio_example.mp3 -p spleeter:2stems -o output is not Python code (so it cannot be run in Spyder), it is intended to be run on your terminal (for instance in Anaconda Prompt)
