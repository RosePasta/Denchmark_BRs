	<summary>[Bug] ValueError: Couldn't find trained model at pretrained_models/2stems.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I ran the sample with python API, the error was raised. I could not find any pretrained model in this repo either. Do I need to train a model by myself?
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Installed using pip
Run:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    from spleeter.separator import Separator
    separator = Separator('spleeter:2stems')

    from spleeter.utils.audio.adapter import get_default_audio_adapter
    audio_loader = get_default_audio_adapter()
    sr = 22050
    waveform, _ = audio_loader.load(wav_file, sample_rate=sr)

    prediction = separator.separate(waveform)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The error is raised at the last line.
ValueError: Couldn't find trained model at pretrained_models/2stems.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;










OS
MacOS 10.14

		No you don't have to, we choose to make model available through Github release :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases/tag/v1.4.0&gt;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases/tag/v1.4.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The library will automatically download required model archive if not found on disk. If you have this error , it means that the download step failed somehow. Could you give us the full traceback of the raised exception ?

		Oh, I see.
I was not aware the spleeter needed to download model resources, so it seemed to become not responding and I terminated the jupyter notebook kernel. After that, though the directory 'pretained_models/2stems' was created, the model has not finished downloading. Maybe the program considers that the model should exist when the above directory exists.
Now I delete the 'pretrained' directory and it seems to restart to download again. Therefore, it would be better to print some hint to inform users of downloading files. :)
Thanks!

We do actually log output about model downloading, we will try to improve logging on the next iteration :).
