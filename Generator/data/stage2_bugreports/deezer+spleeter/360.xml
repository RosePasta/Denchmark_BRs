--&gt;Hi there, I believe spleeter only works on Python3 versions, up to 3.7. Maybe upgrading your python to 3.7.5 could help, I’m currently running it and I have no issues.Best regards: Donavin.  From: Gregory SitninSent: Thursday, 07 May 2020 09:14To: deezer/spleeterCc: SubscribedSubject: Re: [deezer/spleeter] [Bug] solving environment failed (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/360&gt;#360&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

it seems to be an issue with your conda install, some people had the same issue and tried various solutions here : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9367&gt;conda/conda#9367&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		There seems to be a major issue with Conda, so I ended up using pip to install spleeter, and that worked fie. I had to manually install ffmpeg and and the path to my environment variables, no big deal.

Yeah, i just gave up on the program itself and instead went with the GUI that was made by boy1dr, 'cause i don't know jack shit about coding. So yay, now i don't need to enter enormous amounts of text into a CMD to get something to work. all i have to do now is click a few buttons.
