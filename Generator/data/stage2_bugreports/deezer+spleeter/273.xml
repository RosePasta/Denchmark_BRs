		It seems that your CPU does not support AVX. You can try to build tensorflow from source on your machine and manually install your compiled package. It works for me.

Follow the steps described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . For spleeter, you have to manually download the source code of tensorflow version 1.14.0 instead of downloading them by git (it will download a newer version which is not 1.14.0)

Already followed the steps then stopped at the "Download the TensorFlow source code" section. How do I manually install it without by git, I try to find a way but i dont see it?

You can find the code on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.14.0&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.14.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
Download it, uncompress it, and simply skip the "Download the TensorFlow source code" section.
