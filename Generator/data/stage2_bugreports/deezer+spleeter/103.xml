	<summary>[Bug] Trailing slash on output path will break the process</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When specifying the output path, a trailing slash will render the process useless.

		This might be solely a windows bug. I tested using trailing slashes on Mac and it works as expected.

even if it seems to work (sometimes i don't have vocals, sometimes i don't have instrumental when using 2stems
and if i use longer audios it stop after ffmpeg reading correctly the audio so i think thoses lines are an issue

It is not. Please read FAQ about warnings, memory requirements, and FFmpeg related issues.

Not an issue for UNIX based system. It maybe is for Windows although your provided log trace do not relate to the problem you mention. Please reopen the issue with detailed error logs.

		What is there to log? It fails 100% of the time, anybody can try it.
Edit: That's the reason I din't provide the full log trace, because indeed it's not related to the problem,
I just thought that people would understand that if they get a similar error, they might have a trailing slash in the output path.
Removing the trailing slash should fix the problem.
