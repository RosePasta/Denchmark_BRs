	<summary>ValueError: Can't load save_path when it is None</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After resetting my computer, I can no longer successfully run Spleeter.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Installed using Conda
Run $ spleeter separate -i /Users/user/Desktop/song.mp3 -p spleeter:2stems -o output
Got ValueError: Can't load save_path when it is None.

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have the same problem.
OS; Windows 10
Installation type: Conda

Finally, I used docker image to run spleeter successfully.

		The error is caused by the lack of the pretrained data model.
Here is the solution: git clone spleeter to local directory, say ~/spleeter, then cd spleeter, then run the spleeter command; this time spleeter won't throw an exception, but download the pretrained data model needed for execution.

		Hi all,
I've updated the FAQ with an entry on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/5.-FAQ#save-path-error&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Hope this helps.

		That did not work for me, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mmoussallam&gt;@mmoussallam&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . It keeps throwing a AttributeError:  error.
What I did instead, which seemed to work, was to download the model directly from github (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases/download/v1.4.0/2stems.tar.gz&gt;https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/releases/download/v1.4.0/2stems.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and extract them into the pretrained_mode/2stems folder. Doing that, it works

After that, it should be uncompress in the folder.

		If you Ctrl+C while spleeter is downloading a pretrained model, you may end up with this error, at which point you can simply delete the pretrained_models directory in your current directory and re-run spleeter to redownload the pretrained model.

This is exactly what I did, thank you very much.

		Problem solved.
Download pretrained models from release, and then unzip&amp;put it in spleeter\pretrained_models\2stems
