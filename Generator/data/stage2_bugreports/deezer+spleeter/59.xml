	<summary>Model Repeat Download</summary>
	<description>
After I ran the demo script using the audio example file, when i tried it with my own music file, it again downloads the previously downloaded model which I feel makes it very slow and inefficient

		If you are using the docker image, read the paragraph starting with 'For using your own audio file you will need to create contain' on the Usage page

		I'm have this need as well. Whenever I attempt to use the 5Stem split I get 5 wav files with basically the same content. The 2 and 4 stem models work very well.  I lost network connection when the 5stem model was downloading and I cannot figure out how to force a re-download of the model.

		I fixed my issue:

download the 5stem.tar.gz file
replace contents of spleeter/pretrained_models/5stem with contents of tar.gz

		I tried the third time using custom audio - 2stems and this time it worked without downloading.
