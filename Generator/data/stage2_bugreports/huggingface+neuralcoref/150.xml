	<summary>Clarify in the docs how to get 'en_coref_sm' which is in your server.py example?</summary>
	<description>
It seems that python -m spacy download en_coref_sm doesn't install the neural coref model... and the server.py example just fails without any info on this.  Probably just needs a doc line in the README about what to do here?
Thanks, Lynn

		Oh you are right, the server.py example is out-dated now.
I'll update it to be compatible with NeuralCoref 4.0

		Ok this is fixed now, and I've added a more detailed section on using  in the readme &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref#using-neuralcoref-as-a-server&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
