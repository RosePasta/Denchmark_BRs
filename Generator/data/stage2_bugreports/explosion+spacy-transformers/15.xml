	<summary>Spacy BERT model failed to download the model bin and config</summary>
	<description>
I am working in behind proxy, hence I can't download Spacy's model from my code.
So, I use to direct download my model and install them manually(pip install de_pytt_bertbasecased_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz)
With the previous models I used the following code to init my base model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import en_core_web_md  
nlp = en_core_web_md.load()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When I tried to do the same with the BERT model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import en_pytt_bertbaseuncased_lg  
nlp = en_pytt_bertbaseuncased_lg.load()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seem that spacy is trying to reach out to in the model initialization in order to get the model's meat data and the vector's weights, and because I am behind proxy, it fails:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Couldn't reach server at 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-uncased-config.json' to download pretrained model configuration file.
Couldn't reach server at 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-uncased-pytorch_model.bin' to download pretrained weights.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Any solution?

		This is very strange â€“ the wrapper shouldn't have to connect to Hugging Face's bucket at all and the package should include everything it needs ðŸ¤” This was one of the main motivations for repackaging the models. So it seems like something is going wrong here.

		Getting error "type object 'BertModel' has no attribute 'config'" now instead (sorry for not posting whole stack trace... Also behind proxy so I have to comment from my phone :(  )

 This what I'm having now as well
BTW It's also happening in the german BERT model.
seem like a bountiful of of the pytt_model parameters didn't initialize correctly.
i.e. input_shape, max_length,out_put_shape and of course n0
