	<summary>NEC agent recovery problem</summary>
	<description>
coached Pong_NEC for 3 days and got positive total reword each episode and using '-s 3600'.
then try to recovery the agent using '-crd' option from the experiment folder,
total reword each episode drop to around -21 ~ -19 .
So, DND dictionary need to be save and recovery also, other than tensors , right ?
