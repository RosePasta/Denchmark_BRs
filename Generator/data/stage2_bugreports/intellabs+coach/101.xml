	<summary>Starred expressions with dict (Syntax error)</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to run coach on my Mac (has both Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 installed). For both versions, I continue to get the syntax  error on using starred expressions with dict. Although this error should not occur for versions &gt; Python 3.5.
File "/Users/ganapathy-varghese/PycharmProjects/coach-master/agents/actor_critic_agent.py", line 104
result = self.main_network.online_network.accumulate_gradients({**current_states, 'output_1_0': actions},
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Any help is much appreciated.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Gapri13&gt;@Gapri13&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we haven't seen this before, but we did not test on python3.7 so far. Also, python 2.7 is not supported anymore, and a lot of the code relies on python 3 features.
Can you please check with python 3.5 or python 3.6?
We also made a major update to the code base, which I don't expect to influence this issue, but anyway I would suggest to update coach.
