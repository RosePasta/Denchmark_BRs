Just delete and reinstall coach today.

		Quick workaround, in network_wrapper.py:
-make model_saver a class variable (NetworkWrapper.model_saver) such that it gets overwritten with the latest model saver that has the latest list of variables
The bug is partly because only self.main_network.save_model() gets called. The Saver should probably be refactored out of NetworkWrapper or initialised with 'variables_to_restore' only after all networks have been built.

		we have fixed a few issues with checkpointing. everything seems to work well now with release 0.10.0, and also specifically the Mujoco_DDPG preset. please reopen the issue, if you encounter any more issues.
