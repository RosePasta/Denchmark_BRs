	<summary>OpenAI Gym Latest Version Incompatible with Example</summary>
	<description>
The latest OpenAI gym doesn't come with BreakoutDeterministic-v3.
They mention it here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openai/gym#whats-new&gt;https://github.com/openai/gym#whats-new&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


2017-05-13: BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY: The Atari environments are now at v4. To keep using the old v3 environments, keep gym &lt;= 0.8.2 and atari-py &lt;= 0.0.21. Note that the v4 environments will not give identical results to existing v3 results, although differences are minor.

To downgrade you can run:
pip install gym[atari]==0.8.2
This gets the Breakout_A3C preset to work. I haven't tried replacing the preset with BreakoutDeterministic-v4 yet.
Looks like Breakout wouldn't work without installing gym[atari] vs just gym anyway:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NervanaSystems/coach/blob/6009b73eb60f6a79daa2a0028f8feafda3635f7d/install.sh#L171&gt;https://github.com/NervanaSystems/coach/blob/6009b73eb60f6a79daa2a0028f8feafda3635f7d/install.sh#L171&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And it's for this preset:

		Hi Zac, thanks for bringing this up!
We are working with the latest gym version so v4 should be used.
We pushed a fix for this issue in the following commit:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IntelLabs/coach/commit/43bc35916621589bbac101eee11c5640a521067d&gt;43bc359&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
