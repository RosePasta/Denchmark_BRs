on ubuntu 16.04 with latest tornado, the dashboard doesn't work,I get this error:
python3 dashboard.py
2018-03-31 20:46:20,060 Starting Bokeh server version 0.12.7 (running on Tornado 5.0.1)
ERROR:init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'io_loop'
which specific version of tornado do you need with bokeh? It seems like this is a recent tornado issue:

		Did you tried it with the virtual environment they delivered?
I have bokeh 0.12.7 and tornado 4.5.1 and it works.

		If you have a look under Installation in the README.md
They deliver a full working(hopefully) virtual environment with the right versions to avoid conflicts and that nobody has to change his system or install any requirements to get coach to work.
You have to either activate it or call the interpreter in that directory. I'm not sure which version they deliver in the virtual env because i changed it alot myself.

		Thanks guys, this is caused by a bug in the bokeh library where they are not enforcing the tornado version.
