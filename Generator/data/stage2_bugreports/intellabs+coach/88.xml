	<summary>DFP algorithm  examples?</summary>
	<description>
I was testing the DFP algorithm, I couldn't get the vizdoom env to work, so I tried getting CartPole to work with DFP using the same parameters:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;class CartPole_DFP(Preset):
    def __init__(self):
        Preset.__init__(self, DFP, GymVectorObservation, ExplorationParameters)
        self.env.level = 'CartPole-v0'
        self.agent.num_episodes_in_experience_replay = 200
        self.learning_rate = 0.00025
        self.num_heatup_steps = 1000
        self.exploration.epsilon_decay_steps = 10000
        self.agent.use_accumulated_reward_as_measurement = True

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I train with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python coach.py -p CartPole_DFP -e test1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and I get this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "coach.py", line 272, in &lt;module&gt;
    agent = eval(tuning_parameters.agent.type + '(env_instance, tuning_parameters)')

    self.measurements_size = tuning_parameters.env.measurements_size = (self.measurements_size[0] + 1,)
TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tried with several other environments using all the same parameters as the vizdoom examples and they all die with the same error.
Does the DFP algorithm work? Would it make sense to have a DFP example that works with a more simple gym environment for showcasing purposes? The current presets only has DFP running with Vizdoom which is pretty hard to install.

		DFP was indeed not working properly.
I pushed some fixes to deal with several changes we've made in previous commits that broke parts of the code. The relevant commit is: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IntelLabs/coach/commit/52eb159f696e9cd810072c3a2cc350ae8843f707&gt;52eb159&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I also added a working  preset you can try out.
From our experience, installing vizdoom is not so painful. We use the following commands which may be helpful for you as well:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sudo -E apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev zlib1g-dev libjpeg-dev \
    nasm tar libbz2-dev libgtk2.0-dev cmake git libfluidsynth-dev libgme-dev \
    libopenal-dev timidity libwildmidi-dev unzip -y

pip install vizdoom==1.1.4

export VIZDOOM_ROOT=`pip show vizdoom | awk '/Location/{print $2}'`/vizdoom
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention
