	<summary>Error with Vizdoom</summary>
	<description>
It seems there is something wrong with the Vizdoom environment.
I try VIZDOOM_ROOT=/home/nina/ViZDoom python3 coach.py -p Doom_Basic_Dueling_DDQN  , but receive the following error.

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "coach.py", line 271, in 
env_instance = create_environment(tuning_parameters)
File "/home/nina/test/RL/coach/environments/init.py", line 32, in create_environment

		Try replacing self.observation with self.state on line 138 of doom_environment_wrapper.py

If that does it, I'll submit a PR when i get to a computer later.

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zach-nervana&gt;@zach-nervana&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Thanks for your reply.
I have modified as you suggested. It started trianing, but the training reward and test reward maintain -300 after one day and a half's training. The running command is .
I tried to play myself to figure out what the '-300 reward'  means, with ``VIZDOOM_ROOT=/home/nina/ViZDoom python3 coach.py -p Doom_Basic_Dueling_DDQN --play`.
After given an 'ATTACK' action, it returns the foolowing error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

.
In the new version of Coach, this should work fine.
Try running a single worker using .
It should train in several minutes.
