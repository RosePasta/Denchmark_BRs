		Seems like mkl-dnn installation is crashing.
mkl-dnn is not mandatory, but can boost performance a lot.
Please try following the instructions &lt;denchmark-link:https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-dnn-part-1-library-overview-and-installation&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to install mkl-dnn manually.
I tested this instructions on a clean Ubuntu 16.04 with no issues.
Let me know if the manual installation also crashes.

		This issue should be fixed following release 0.9.0.
I am closing the issue, please reopen it if the problem persists.
