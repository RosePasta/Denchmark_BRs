	<summary>Two typos in coach.py</summary>
	<description>
In line 263, 269, 276 of coach.py of master branch, what does the --experiment_type means?  And the --environemnt_type should be --environment_type, just a typo.
One another problem: the file says

"If no preset is defined, a preset can be set from the command-line by combining settings "
"which are set by using --agent_type, --experiment_type, --environemnt_type"

but it autually shows this thing when I run coach -at ddpg_agent -et control_suite_environment -ept e-greedy :

Please choose a preset using the -p flag or use the --play flag together with choosing an environment type (-et) in order to play the game.

The arguments help information is outdated?

		Hi,
The documentation is indeed outdated. Defining a preset directly from command-line is not supported at the moment.
The only supported usage for setting an environment_type from command-line is for playing an environment as a HumanAgent, and then using the created dataset for running Behavioral Cloning (imitation learning).
For example, for playing MontezumaRevenge and creating a dataset, you could use:
coach  --play -et rl_coach.environments.gym_environment:Atari -lvl MontezumaRevengeDeterministic-v4
The documentation is indeed a bit lacking on this front and needs to be improved. Thanks for filing the issue.
