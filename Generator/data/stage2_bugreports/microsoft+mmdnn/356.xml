	<summary>Code Review</summary>

Hi there,
I read the code, and find a little thing that's maybe not worth mentioning.
I find the code in the file named IRToModel.
There's a statement in it.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;elif args.framework == 'cntk':
    raise NotImplementedError("Destination [Tensorflow] is not implemented yet.")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The "Tensorflow" may be "cntk" here.
