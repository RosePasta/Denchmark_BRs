	<summary>TensorflowEmitter has not supported operator [sum].</summary>
	<description>
This happened to me when converting a Caffe ResNet model to TensorFlow. I used Python 3 and MMdnn-0.1.1, installed via pip.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dhaase-de&gt;@dhaase-de&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , could you try to edit the mapper.py
around line 199
    def map_eltwise(cls, node):
        operations = {0: 'mul', 1: 'sum', 2: 'max'}
to
    def map_eltwise(cls, node):
        operations = {0: 'Mul', 1: 'Add', 2: 'Max'}
And see if it works. Thanks.

		With your suggested edit, the export finishes without errors. I don't have the time now to verify the exported TensorFlow net, but the code looks good and it loads without errors in Python 3. Thanks!
