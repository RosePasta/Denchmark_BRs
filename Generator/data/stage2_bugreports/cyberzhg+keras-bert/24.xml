		There is nothing I can do because the incompatibility happens between Keras and Tensorflow. Keras has a branch named "tf-2" that solves the compatibility problem with Tensorflow 2.0. I don't think you should use a preview version of Tensorflow while Keras has no stable release for it.

		   else: tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtype, shape=shape, name=name)

In here I change like this...
For similar error, I have to change it manually.
