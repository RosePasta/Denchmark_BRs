Describe the Bug
After upgrading to ver 0.80.0, when run "load_trained_model_from_checkpoint()", I got following warning messages:

WARNING: Entity &lt;bound method Masked.call of &lt;keras_bert.layers.masked.Masked object at 0x7faf94bdd4a8&gt;&gt; could not be transformed and will be executed as-is. Please report this to the AutgoGraph team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10) and attach the full output. Cause: converting &lt;bound method Masked.call of &lt;keras_bert.layers.masked.Masked object at 0x7faf94bdd4a8&gt;&gt;: AttributeError: module 'gast' has no attribute 'Num'
WARNING: Entity &lt;bound method Extract.call of &lt;keras_bert.layers.extract.Extract object at 0x7faf94bdd9b0&gt;&gt; could not be transformed and will be executed as-is.

Version Info

 I'm using the latest version

Minimal Codes To Reproduce
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Load basic model&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import codecs
from keras_bert import load_trained_model_from_checkpoint
token_dict = {}
with codecs.open(vocab_path, 'r', 'utf8') as reader:
for line in reader:
token = line.strip()
token_dict[token] = len(token_dict)
model = load_trained_model_from_checkpoint(
config_path,
checkpoint_path,
training=True,
trainable=True,
seq_len=SEQ_LEN,
)
