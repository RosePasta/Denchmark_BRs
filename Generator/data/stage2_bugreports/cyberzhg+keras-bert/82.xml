	<summary>gelu and tensorflow 2.0 beta</summary>
	<description>
When using tf 2.0.0-beta0 and the latest keras_bert, during model compilation I receive the following warnings:
W0618 19:12:57.727632 139870689343296 ag_logging.py:145] Entity &lt;function gelu at 0x7f35b5f946a8&gt; could not be transformed and will be executed as-is. Please report this to the AutoGraph team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10) and attach the full output. Cause: converting &lt;function gelu at 0x7f35b5f946a8&gt;: KeyError: LIVE_VARS_IN
this can be resolved by doing the following:
from keras_bert import bert
from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops import erf, sqrt
def gelu(x):
return 0.5 * x * (1.0 + erf(x / sqrt(2.0)))
bert.gelu = gelu
Autograph can not properly deal with the K.backend=='tensorflow' within the gelu function, the best way is probably to define the gelu function based on the backend and not to check the backend with every function call to gelu
