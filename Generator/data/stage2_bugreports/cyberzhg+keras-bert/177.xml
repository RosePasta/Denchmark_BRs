Describe the Bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Version Info

 I'm using the latest version

Minimal Codes To Reproduce
import keras_bert
from keras_bert import load_vocabulary, load_trained_model_from_checkpoint, Tokenizer, get_checkpoint_paths
from keras_bert.datasets import get_pretrained, PretrainedList

model_path = get_pretrained(PretrainedList.chinese_base)
paths = get_checkpoint_paths(model_path)
model = load_trained_model_from_checkpoint(paths.config, paths.checkpoint, seq_len=30)
model.summary(line_length=120)

sentence_1 = '数学是利用符号语言研究數量、结构、变化以及空间等概念的一門学科。'
sentence_2 = '从某种角度看屬於形式科學的一種。'
print('Tokens:', tokenizer.tokenize(first=sentence_1, second=sentence_2))
indices, segments = tokenizer.encode(first=sentence_1, second=sentence_2)
masks = np.array([[0] * len(indices)])

predicts = model.predict([np.array([indices]), np.array([segments]), masks])[1]
the error happens in the last line of code and the corresponding bug is :
ValueError: Error when checking model input: the list of Numpy arrays that you are passing to your model is not the size the model expected. Expected to see 2 array(s), but instead got the following list of 3 arrays:
it means that I shall just input array with two lists such as [indices, segments] rather than input array with three lists such as [indices, segments, masks]

		Is this still relevant? If so, what is blocking it? Is there anything you can do to help move it forward?
This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs.
