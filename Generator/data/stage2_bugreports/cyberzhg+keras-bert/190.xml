	<summary>keras-bert relies on features removed in keras-transformer 0.34.0</summary>
	<description>
Describe the Bug
The get_model function in the keras_bert.bert module passes a use_adapter parameter to the keras_transformers.get_encoders function:



keras-bert/keras_bert/bert.py


         Line 124
      in
      26bdfe3






 use_adapter=use_adapter, 





However, the latest commit to , corresponding to the v0.34.0 release, removes this parameter from the API:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CyberZHG/keras-transformer/commit/60f1a0968caba6adb914a14b743f0ffbdc176a18&gt;CyberZHG/keras-transformer@60f1a09&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

keras-bert specifies its keras-transformer dependency as &gt;=0.30.0.  This means that new or upgraded installs will automatically use 0.34.0 despite the breaking change.
This means that calling get_model fails with the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: get_encoders() got an unexpected keyword argument 'use_adapter'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The problem can be worked around by pinning the keras-transformer version at v0.33.0.
Version Info

 I'm using the latest version

Minimal Codes To Reproduce
The problem can be seen by running the load_and_predict.py demo.

		Experiencing the same error when calling predict function - followed advise and changed keras-transformer==0.33.0, worked after this.

		Thanks. I removed all the "adapter"-related things.

 thanks.  May be worth also releasing a v0.81.1 patch release which sets an upper bound on the  dependency, but your call if that's really needed.

		Is this still relevant? If so, what is blocking it? Is there anything you can do to help move it forward?

		I'm assuming a v0.81.1 is not on the cards (fair call), so closing, as the issue has been fixed.

 Added one: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/keras-bert/0.81.1/&gt;https://pypi.org/project/keras-bert/0.81.1/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
