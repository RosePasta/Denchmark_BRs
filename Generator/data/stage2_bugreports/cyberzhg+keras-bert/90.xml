	<summary>Tensorflow 2 Error</summary>
	<description>
I am getting a AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'placeholder' on tensorflow 2.0-gpu
Looks like its coming from the backend.py file.
Is the code TF2.0 compliant now? I was under the impression it was but maybe I am wrong

		It's documented in the Chinese version of README. Add TF_KERAS=1 to your environment variables.
