	<summary>error on codec call, no file found</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I am trying to run the codec call below but I am getting and error that the file is not found.
Also, isn't the codec call deprecated?
Also, I am not sure that the extract embeddings section of this code is supposed to do.  Is it writing the results?

		Is this still relevant? If so, what is blocking it? Is there anything you can do to help move it forward?

		You should replace xxx.txt to the name of your own file.
