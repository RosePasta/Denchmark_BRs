	<summary>Slow predictions</summary>
	<description>
Describe the Bug
When I run the model on Colab TPU everything works fine up until the prediction step.  Then It estimates hours to predict the x_test set.
Version Info

[x ] I'm using the latest version

Minimal Codes To Reproduce
import keras_bert

# @title Predict

predicts = model.predict(test_x, verbose=True).argmax(axis=-1)
