Describe the Bug
Hi,
I am trying to copy and paste the code from one of your notebooks into my own. When I get to the last cell, I am presented with this error message:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'ReplicatedVariable' and 'float'
Version Info

 I'm using the latest version

Minimal Codes To Reproduce
# @title Extraction
import numpy as np
from keras_bert import Tokenizer

tokenizer = Tokenizer(token_dict)
text = 'From that day forth... my arm changed... and a voice echoed'
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
indices, segments = tokenizer.encode(first=text, max_len=512)
print(tokens)

with tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope(get_custom_objects()):
    predicts = tpu_model.predict([np.array([indices] * 8), np.array([segments] * 8)])[0]
    
for i, token in enumerate(tokens):
    print(token, predicts[i].tolist()[:19])
pass
