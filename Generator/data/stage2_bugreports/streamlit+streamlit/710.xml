	<summary>Fix Danny's S3 sharing issue</summary>
	<description>
It looks like [s3] keyPrefix=... isn't making it into the URLs being fetched from S3.
This is the address of a manifest protobuf we want to fetch:
https://yelp-people-dev.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/~dqn/st/0.49.0-A8NT/reports/NJphBiGR4twz88mU9wTegn/manifest.pb
And this is the address that's being generated:
https://yelp-people-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/~dqn/reports/NJphBiGR4twz88mU9wTegn/manifest.pb
The generated address is missing the st/&lt;streamlit version&gt; bits. Looks like we're splitting on a forward slash on the pathname in ConnectionManager.fetchManifest, which is giving us the wrong result because the keyPrefix itself has a forward slash.
