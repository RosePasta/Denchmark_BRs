&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Streamlit started giving 404: Not Found and no longer wants to work.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Added the multiselect example to my code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;options = st.multiselect(
    'What are your favorite colors',
    ('Yellow', 'Red')
    ('Green', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Blue'))
st.write('You selected:', options)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

To get an app with a working multiselect
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

App gives 404: Not Found and nothing I do wants to make it work again.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Streamlit version: 0.47.2
Python version: 3.7.1
Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? pip on WinPython
OS version: Windows 10 version 1903
Browser version: Firefox 69.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Additional information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Tried changing the port, enabling debugging, killing the console and restarting. Not running jupyter-lab. Removing the multiselect code. Tried using http://localhost:8501/?a=1. Tried http://192.168.1.34:8501. Seems to be caching and always just returning the 404.

		Also, we are still looking into this, but we believe this issue has to do with Windows, not your code snippet, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Code4SAFrankie&gt;@Code4SAFrankie&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
After correcting a small bug in your code &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Code4SAFrankie&gt;@Code4SAFrankie&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I found that this worked for me (on MacOS):
import streamlit as st

options = st.multiselect(
    'What are your favorite colors',
    ('Green', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Blue'),
    ('Yellow', 'Red'))
st.write('You selected:', options)

Install 0.47.0 still gives me the same error unfortunately.

		Update: I was able to install Streamlit and run streamlit hello on a Windows VM without issues*.
*Well that's not 100% true... I ran into this #236 , but that's not Windows-specific and we have a fix coming out!
Then I re-read the issue and realized you're using something called WinPython â€” so let me try that tomorrow.
Clearly I'm not a Windows expert ðŸ‘¶ , apologies for the delay!

 Im having the same issue but Im not using WinPython, I run with anaconda. The config.py also  hard codes the port in to 8051, I changed it in that script to see if that helps but it didnt. I also found that the address was hard coded to localHost and changed to various other valid localhost addresses in Server.py etc but that didnt help either. Hope it helps somewhat or might just be useless information.

		You probably already checked this, but just to get the obvious things out of the way: can you make sure Windows Firewall is not blocking Streamlit?
I noticed that when I first ran a Streamlit app on Windows I had to click through a dialog to allow it to use port 8501. I don't know if there's some situation that would cause the firewall to revoke that permission behind the scenes...

		Yeah &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tvst&gt;@tvst&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 double checked that and changed the port as well in case that was the cause.

		Note that you can't run jupyter-lab and streamlit at the same time, since they both by default use the same port; but even getting the 404 without running jupyter-lab. Streamlit did initially work, but then stopped working and instead giving 404.

Awesome, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ismailuddin&gt;@ismailuddin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !! Thanks for the work-around.
I'm still having problems reproducing the issue, though. So I have some more questions:

Did a previous version of Streamlit ever work? If so, can you downgrade and confirm? (When doing this, use streamlit version to double-check which version you're on)
Can you send me a HAR file for what happens when you go to localhost:8501/ and when you go to localhost:8501/index.html?

Here's a page talking about how to grab a HAR file in different browsers: &lt;denchmark-link:https://community.box.com/t5/Managing-Content-Troubleshooting/How-to-Generate-Network-Captures-for-Troubleshooting/ta-p/366&gt;https://community.box.com/t5/Managing-Content-Troubleshooting/How-to-Generate-Network-Captures-for-Troubleshooting/ta-p/366&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Note that you can't run jupyter-lab and streamlit at the same time, since they both by default use the same port;

Weird. On my machine, JupyterLab uses 8888 while Streamlit uses 8501. Are you saying they're both on 8501 on your machine?
Also, since version 0.47.0 Streamlit tries to find an open port when 8501 is taken. So even if JupyterLab is on that port Streamlit should run fine.
Edit: I just realized the port-finder code isn't working on Python 2. We have a fix and will have it out with the next release. This is fixed since 0.47.4

		Yup on my machine Jupyter Lab is using port 8888 as well so it shouldn't actually be interfering. Tbh, I didn't actually try without JLab since it's practically always running on my laptop. Unfortunately I don't have access to my Windows machine for a few days so won't be able to try any of that out just yet.

		Thanks, that makes sense! So I'm assuming the JupyterLab thing is a red herring at this point.
My best guess is that this would be fixed if we modified &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/lib/streamlit/server/Server.py#L236&gt;this function call&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in  to this:
            routes.extend(
                [
                    (r"/(.*)", StaticFileHandler, {
                        "path": "%s/" % static_path,
                        "default_filename": "index.html",
                    }),
                ]
            )
But I can't repro the issue, so I can't verify that this fixes it. (Although we should probably do this anyway since it's cleaner than the current code!)
That said, if any enterprising soul would like verify that the above solves your problem, that would be amazing ðŸ˜ƒ
