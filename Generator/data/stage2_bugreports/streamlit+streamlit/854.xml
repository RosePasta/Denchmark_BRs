	<summary>st.cache: Wrong warning message when input parameter cannot be hashed</summary>
	<description>
import streamlit as st
import socket

@st.cache
def test_cache(socket):
    pass

test_cache(socket.socket())
The above code throws an error because socket.socket can't be hashed by the caching function. The fix is to change the st.cache declaration to @st.cache(hash_funcs={socket.socket: id}).
However, the warning we show makes no mention of hash_funcs, or the fact that it's a function parameter that's not being hashed properly. Instead, it suggests using the allow_output_mutation=True flag (which doesn't fix the issue), and also gives a lengthy explanation about adding your virtualenv to the folderBlacklist (which also doesn't fix the issue.)
