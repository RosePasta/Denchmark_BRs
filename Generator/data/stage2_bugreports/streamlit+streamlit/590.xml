	<summary>multiselect box makes the page walk after updating the value</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When selecting a value having scroll down a bit makes the page scroll down a little bit when the multiselect box updates to include the selected value, making the Cypress tests screen captures not equal sometimes due to the scrolling event happening in the same moment as the screen capture, sometimes a bit after sometimes a bit before.

as can be seen in the image above, that scroll occurred just by changing the value.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:

Run multiselect script and navigate to it.
scroll down a little bit so the scroll is not at starting position
update the value of a multiselect box and see the page move on its own.

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Page should not scroll down because a value was updated, it is acceptable for the page to grow but now to scroll down.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Page scrolls down when updating multiselect box values.
