&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Details&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript/security/advisories/GHSA-h9rv-jmmf-4pgx&gt;GHSA-h9rv-jmmf-4pgx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

moderate severity
Vulnerable versions: &lt; 2.1.1
Patched version: 2.1.1
regular expressions Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Impact&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions.
This vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of RegExp.prototype.toString() backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions.
If serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Patches&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This was patched in v2.1.1.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Additional info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I believe this vuln doesn't really matter for us since the offending library is only used during development. But would still be nice to address it anyway!

		Is this related to express or? My app was working fine, and now the response went from array of objects to an error (dev env) and bunch of HTML (prod env)...

I tried doing this but it isn't working for some reason. I ran the command you specified but my serialize javascript is still 1.7.0. Any insights on why this is the case would be greatly appreciated.

		"npm audit fix" after you npm install. npm will display this automatically when install has run. Has fixed some of the warnings with me.
