		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bwanaaa&gt;@bwanaaa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Streamlit cannot be run from within a Jupyter notebook nor from within an interpreter.  It must be run from the operating system's command line environment after you've done pip install streamlit within a virtual environment.
Ironically, you linked to a forum post in which someone tried to run streamlit hello within jupyter "which failed as well" because it will never work.  The answer on the forum post you linked to is still the correct answer.  :)
You should use Anaconda to open a terminal.  Run pip install streamlit inside that terminal, and streamlit hello inside that terminal as well.
Thanks for your question -- I hope the answer helps!
