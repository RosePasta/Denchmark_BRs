		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ivyw1219&gt;@Ivyw1219&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Could you please copy/paste the text in your terminal where you're executing the streamlit command so we can verify the file you're running it against?

		Hi @lvyw1219,
did you use streamlit run app ?
The correct start should be streamlit run app.py

		Hey, Jonathan and Matthias,
Thanks for your reply.

It’s a bit weird. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.
But I don’t think that is Streamlit’s problem, maybe it is just  my config issue.

If you provide the following info we can help you debug and will re-open the issue.

Which config are you referring to?
Copy/paste the text in your terminal where you're executing the streamlit command

Also can you upgrade to the latest streamlit version, 0.57.3?

		Also as MattMacs mentioned, when I try to run streamlit run file instead of streamlit run file.py I get the error you shared
