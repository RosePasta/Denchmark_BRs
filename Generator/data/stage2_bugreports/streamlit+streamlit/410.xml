		I'm not able to repro this. Running streamlit run examples/graphviz_example.py and reloading a bunch of times doesn't result in any visual change.
Is there a known example that triggers the bug?
(Couldn't repro on Mac or Ubuntu 19.10)

		I can't repro this in 0.51.0 anymore. But I just double-checked and I definitely can repro in 0.50.x
So I'm not going crazy â€” but it this looks like it's fixed anyway!
