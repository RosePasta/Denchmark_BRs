	<summary>Clean up the terminal warning about XSRF and CORS</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As part of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/1571&gt;#1571&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 a warning was introduced if XSRF and CORS are both enabled. The warning is showing all the time. Also the warning is not clear. Need to improve the warning to better describe to user what's happening
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The warning should not be showing on commands such as make install.
