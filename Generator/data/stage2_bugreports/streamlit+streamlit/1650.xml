	<summary>Tensorflow's new version breaks pytests</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

tensorflow has released a new version (2.3.0rc0) on June 27, 2020 which breaks test_keras_model and test_tf_keras_model pytests. I've silenced the issue by downgrading the dependency, but we need to solve it appropriately.

		I'm pretty positive &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/1771&gt;#1771&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes this. I did update the tests to not skip since (later versions of) Tensorflow support Python 3.8.
