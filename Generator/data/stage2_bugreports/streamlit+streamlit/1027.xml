		The issue here is our ForwardMsgCache, which caches every message during a run, and only prunes after the next run. We need to do something smarter here - maybe we stop caching after the cache size is too big? Or we prune older entries (this probably doesn't make more sense, because "older" entries aren't logically older when they're from the same run).
One solution is to set global.minCachedMessageSize = inf in config, which disables the cache.
