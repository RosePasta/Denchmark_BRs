		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/normks&gt;@normks&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
It would be helpful to see your code; however I do have an educated guess about what's going on.  There's a mismatch between what your python interpreter is expecting about the character encodings in your file, and what's actually encoding the characters in your file.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8290206/python-unicodeencodeerror-latin-1-codec-cant-encode-character&gt;I think this StackOverflow question dealing with exactly this problem should help you out here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, or at least give you a better head start.
It's unlikely that this is a Streamlit bug so I am going to close this (can always reopen if I was wrong).
Let me know how it goes!

		Got a similar issue with 0.71.0. The streamlit application works fine on one server, but when migrating to another new server, a problem suddenly appeared. The only difference is in the minor version of Python(??).

		By the way, the error also occurs when starting
streamlit hello 
Looks like some kind of library compatibility issue

		Workaround: I created manually a .streamlit folder and credentials.toml in it
