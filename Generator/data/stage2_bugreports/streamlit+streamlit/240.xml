&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

For one of our users, this code isn't working:
import streamlit as st
x = st.text_area(‘Your text here’)
st.write("Result: ", x)

:

Hi, I am using a text_area and when I press ctrl+enter after typing, I am not getting the result. However, when I click outside the text area box, I see the “RUNNING” message followed by the result.
