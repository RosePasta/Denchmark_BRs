	<summary>Console spammed with /image/jpeg</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've noticed that when using st.image(), the message: "/image/jpeg" or "image/png", depending on format, is being printed into my console. This only seems to happen on Windows, but not when I'm using Windows Subsystem for Linux to launch the server. I believe it's happened in both a Jupyter terminal and PowerShell for me.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:
Example script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("&lt;your_image&gt;")
st.image(img)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Launch the server, and navigate to your console, where you'll see 'image/jpeg'. If you add a trailing space or new line and save, when the code reruns you'll get a new message.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I would expect no log message.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Messages are being printed to the log

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've never noticed it before

		Hey, sorry about this! A recent code change introduced a stray print() statement in our latest release 0.65.2. We've already removed it from our source code (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/commit/7294ac77febd16b394f32c6e1d23038ee7f12a03&gt;7294ac7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) so this will be fixed in our next release (in a week or two); in the meantime, our &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/pre_release_features.html#nightly-releases&gt;nightlies&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should also have this resolved.
And of course, thanks for raising the issue!
