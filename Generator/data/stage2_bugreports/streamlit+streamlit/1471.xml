	<summary>caching and TTL</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

when I throw in a TTL argument in the caching statement
@st.cache(ttl = 60*60*3) it gives me this error
"cache() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ttl'"
But without the ttl argument, it works fine! Any help would be appreciated :)

		Glad you figured it out &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rrnakada&gt;@rrnakada&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Upgrading is one of the best things to try when things like this come up, as we try and move pretty quickly in releasing functionality. We're also working on moving the documentation from just the latest version published to the back history by version, so that you can check the version of the documentation against the package version you are actually using.
Thanks for checking out Streamlit!
