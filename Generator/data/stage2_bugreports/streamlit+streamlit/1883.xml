	<summary>New streamlit.beta_page_config</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I called streamlit.beta_page_config once at the beginning of the code, It works at start, but, when using slider in app, it reports the error:
StreamlitAPIException: beta_set_page_config() can only be called once per app, and must be called as the first Streamlit command in your script. 
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:

Go to 'https://nimani.diplomacy.edu:8502/'
Click on 'Isolation Forest ' radio button from sidebar menu
try to change slider 'Contamination' on sidebar menu

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It should show updated plotly table
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It reports error:
`StreamlitAPIException: beta_set_page_config() can only be called once per app, and must be called as the first Streamlit command in your script.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

That is, did this use to work the way you expected in the past?
no, feature did not exist in earlier versions, since it is a new beta feature
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Python version: 3.7.7
Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? No
OS version: Ubuntu 18.04

		I am also receiving the same error but sporadically.
Refreshing the page is helping sometimes but I am getting this error even when running the program for the first time.
