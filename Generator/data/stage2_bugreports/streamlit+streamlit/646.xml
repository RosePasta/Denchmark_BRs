		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zdxpan&gt;@zdxpan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
thanks for your question!! You can just leave the credential blanks or add empty credential to the .
This is an example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[general]
email = ""
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This PR is also relevant: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/328&gt;#328&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Once that PR lands, when Streamlit runs on a headless server it will skip the credentials step.
We try to detect whether something is headless automatically based on the DISPLAY environment variable, but you can also set it yourself in your config file:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[server]
headless = true
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
