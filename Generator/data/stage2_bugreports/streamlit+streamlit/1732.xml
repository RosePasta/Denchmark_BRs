	<summary>File uploader error (maybe?)</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using st.file_uploader, I face the following error message at the very beginning of uploading a csv file.
and then suddenly the app is refreshed automatically and successfully operated.
any idea why the message is shown at the early stage ??
Error message:
TypeError: 0.0 has type float, but expected one of: int, long
Traceback:
File "/home1/irteamsu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/streamlit/ScriptRunner.py", line 314, in _run_script
exec(code, module.dict)
File "/home1/irteamsu/Untitled8.py", line 54, in 
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV/Excel file",  type="csv")
File "/home1/irteamsu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/streamlit/DeltaGenerator.py", line 140, in wrapped_method

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/angrykim&gt;@angrykim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I noticed you are using Python 2.7 from your stack trace. In that case, you are using a pretty old version of Streamlit. I would recommend upgrading your environment to use Python 3.6+ and try again. It's likely the case that if this was a bug, it was fixed by now, or it could be caused by Python 2.7 itself.
Best,
Randy
