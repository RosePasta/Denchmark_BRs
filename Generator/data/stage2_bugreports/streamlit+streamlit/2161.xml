	<summary>Safari re-requests images inside a column</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import streamlit as st
import time
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open("books.jpg")
# Using this image by URL prevents Safari from reloading
# image = "https://static.streamlit.io/examples/owl.jpg"
# st.image(image, use_column_width=True)
col1, _ = st.beta_columns(2)
col1.image(image, use_column_width=True)

for i in range(10):
    st.write("hi")
    time.sleep(2)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When a 1) local image file is 2) placed inside a column 3) on the latest develop (after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/2158&gt;#2158&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, anyways), each subsequent Streamlit call causes Safari to re-request the image, as shown on Safari's "networks" tab.
Current hypothesis is that this is a caching issue; the reason is that an image loaded via URL does not exhibit the same re-requesting issue

		Note that the re-request itself doesn't have any user-visible effects, as far as I can tell. But the code snippet does seem to trigger the same issue described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2145#issuecomment-707208698&gt;#2145 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 It does give a large amount of flickering, which is kinda weird. The end result is fine, but it's weird loading to get to that.
