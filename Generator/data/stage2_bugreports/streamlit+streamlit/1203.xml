	<summary>Need hash_func for type tf.Session</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

These are all types from the GAN demo that shouldn't be hashed by Streamlit.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Full error message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No included error message, but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/demo-face-gan/blob/master/app.py#L15&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are the associated lines in the GAN demo.

 : Are you writing default hash functions for these three types?

		No I'm not, these are the 3 types we pass to hash_funcs in the face gan demo. This issue should be updated to say fix face gan demo.

		Can someone verify that we want this issue closed, as a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1215&gt;#1215&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

: Not a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1215&gt;#1215&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We should come up with default  for these types as part of Streamlit itself, then verify that it works in &lt;denchmark-link:github.com/streamlit/demo-face-gan&gt;Face GAN demo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 without specifying additional .

		tfutil.Network and tfutil_cpu.Network are user defined classes, so we wouldn't create default hash funcs for them. However, I can investigate if they're currently failing to hash and see why.
For tf.Session, ok.

		Ah gotit. Ok. Let's do `tf.Session` and see if that fixes the other two. (I bet it will.)
