	<summary>module 'streamlit' has no attribute 'beta_container'</summary>
	<description>
I tried to implement the example code introduced in the documentation for beta features : beta_container, beta_columns... However, It returns an error "module 'streamlit' has no attribute 'beta_container'"
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;with st.beta_container():
    st.write("This is inside the container")
    # You can call any Streamlit command, including custom components:
    st.bar_chart(np.random.randn(50, 3))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tried to upgrade the package without success. How can I resolve this issue ?

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/erwanlenagard&gt;@erwanlenagard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you be more specific? What version of Streamlit are you using, and what error did you get when trying to upgrade to the most current version?
Best,
Randy

		I have the same problem. PyCharm doesn't show beta_container or beta_columns as a suggestion for st.beta_, even though beta_color_picker and beta_set_page_config are. dir(st) does not list beta_columns/beta_container nor columns/container
Deactivating and reactivating the virtualenv, reinstalling streamlit through pip, and rebooting my computer have had no effect.
Technical information:
streamlit version: 0.67.1
python version: 3.8
OS: Mac OS X 10.15.6
