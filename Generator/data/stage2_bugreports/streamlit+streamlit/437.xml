	<summary>Code-mutated-a-cached-return-value: bad error message</summary>
	<description>
I wrote this test and ran it twice to trigger the mutation warning:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import streamlit as st

list = [1, 2, 3]
@st.cache()
def return_global():
    global list
    return list

var = return_global()
var.append(4)
st.show(var)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is the warning I got:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709022/66940733-521cea80-effa-11e9-87b5-180b2e0f1913.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The first suggestion is telling me to change some line inside the streamlit caching file itself, which is surely not what's intended.

		Any update about this issue? I encountered the same issue when I pass 'persist=True', because when I don't pass any argument nothing is cached.

		Behavior has changed since this bug was filed (see screenshot which is output of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tconkling&gt;@tconkling&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's code).  Closing since it also looks user problems were solved.
