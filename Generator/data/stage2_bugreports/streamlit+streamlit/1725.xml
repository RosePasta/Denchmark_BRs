	<summary>Regression: missing icons/fonts when deployed under a subpath (not "/")</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When you deploy Streamlit at foo.com/bar/baz, all of Streamlit's static assets will be hosted at foo.com/bar/baz/assets. However, Streamlit is looking for those assets at foo.com/assets.
Culprit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/1635&gt;#1635&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Deploy your app at host where your app will be at a path other than the root
Go to our app

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The app loads and all icons (hamburger menu, for example) and fonts are present
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The app loads but all icons are replaced with squares, and Streamlit doesn't use IBM Plex font.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

yes
