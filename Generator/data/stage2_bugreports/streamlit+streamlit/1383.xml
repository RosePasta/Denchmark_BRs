	<summary>Deploying Streamlit on port 80</summary>
	<description>
Hi! I'm trying trying hard to redirect traffic from port 80 of my server to port 8501 where Streamlit runs by default. I tried both the methods described linked in the official faq (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/FAQ&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) aka the one with apache2 and the one with Nginx but after successfully using the reverse proxy (&lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/configuring-apache-2-4-for-proxy/1866/4&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) the page gets stuck and never loads (as shown in the picture below)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29484911/80186808-e0f46a80-860e-11ea-9181-0ff5a0875be8.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I successfully managed to use the following command on ubuntu to reroute traffic from port 80 to 8051
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8501
However I'm really looking forward to get it working with either apache2 or Nginx in order to use https.
I'm currently using streamlit 0.58

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mr-fcharles&gt;@mr-fcharles&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Did you try setting CORS to false as it is shown &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.streamlit.io/troubleshooting/not-loading.html?#symptom-2-the-app-says-please-wait-forever&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
