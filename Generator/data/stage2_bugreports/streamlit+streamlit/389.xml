	<summary>selectbox not working as expected when "navigating between pages"</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have a multipage app with a Home page and Resources page. On the Resources page I have a multiselect widget. If I select something in that multiselect, navigate back to the home page and navigate back to the "Resources page" then the multiselect shows as empty but the list return from the multiselect is not empty.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Minimum Example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

"""This is a minimum replicating example of this issue
https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-streamlit/issues/7"""
import streamlit as st

pages = ["Home", "Resources"]
tags = ["Awesome", "Social"]

page = st.sidebar.radio("Navigate", options=pages)
st.title(page)
if page == "Resources":
    selection = st.multiselect("Select tag", tags)
    st.write(selection)
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:


run the code using streamlit run &lt;code_file.py&gt;



Navigate to the Resources page



Select the social tag



Navigate back to Home



Navigate back to Resources

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I would expect in step 5 that either

The multiselect returns an empty list  (Preferred).

or

The multiselect shows the "Social" tag as selected (Alternative).

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The multiselect returns a different list than it shows

 Thanks for taking your time testing streamlit!
this had been fixed in version 0.48.0 , which streamlit version are you using?
