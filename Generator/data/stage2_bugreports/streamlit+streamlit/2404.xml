	<summary>[File Uploader] Progress bar does not work in safari</summary>
	<description>
This works in Chrome but not Safari. Initial debugging shows that the our progress bar component is being called. Need to investigate more to see if there is an issue with rendering the Baseweb progress bar too frequently. For some reason it works when deployed on S4A in Safari (probably due to iframing)
