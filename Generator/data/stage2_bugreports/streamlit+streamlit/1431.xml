Could you provide sample code that we can copy/paste and run to reproduce your issue?

		Same issue here, it's intermittent, we're trying to reproduce it consistently and share code.

		A new file uploader has been released in 0.68! It did not seem to be an issue using the new file uploader. Closing for now but happy to reopen if this is still an issue.
