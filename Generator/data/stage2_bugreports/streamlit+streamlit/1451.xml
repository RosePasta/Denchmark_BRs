	<summary>Windows doesn't support emojis on terminal</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Make sure you're on Windows
Make sure Streamlit is not "activated", by removing the credentials file: rm ~/.streamlit/credentials.toml
Run any Streamlit script, such as streamlit hello

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

You should see a message like this on the terminal:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Streamlit!

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

You see instead:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  JUMBLEDTEXTWelcome to Streamlit!

  If you are one of our development partners or are interested in
  getting personal technical support, please enter your email address
  below. Otherwise, you may leave the field blank.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Nope.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Additional information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A good-enough solution here would be to simply not show the emoji on Windows.
Bonus points if we detect whether the user is using the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab#&gt;new Windows Terminal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which  support emojis, and allow emojis in that case.
