	<summary>Can't use odd numbers within Slider Component</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There's no way to use odd numbers steps within slider component.
Using:
st.slider('threshold', 1, 15, value=5, step=2)
Now the initial value is correct but when I try to increment the slider it does so with step equal to 3 resulting in 8. From there it only uses step two and Iâ€™m only able to use even numbers.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The step should be applied to the current value .
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Additional information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		This is a bug (or perhaps the expected behavior?) in baseweb. I opened a bug (and reproduced it in their sandbox) here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uber/baseweb/issues/2417&gt;uber/baseweb#2417&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think we should wait for a response from baseweb before deciding how to mitigate?

		Baseweb fixed this issue. We need to update to the latest Baseweb to get this fixed on our end. I'm going to pause this until that happens.
