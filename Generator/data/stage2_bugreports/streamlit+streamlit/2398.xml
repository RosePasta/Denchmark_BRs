	<summary>global.logLevel IS DEPRECATED.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What is happening with global.logLevel?  Our whole application crashed (running on a copy of version 0.70.0) and we got this warning:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;lobal.logLevel IS DEPRECATED.
global.logLevel has been replaced with logger.level

This option will be removed on or after 2020-11-30.

Please update command-line argument or environment variable.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is set up &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/0.71.0/lib/streamlit/config.py#L241&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on your code in the latest version (0.71.0), but it &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/0.71.0/lib/streamlit/config.py#L304&gt;still has global.logLevel option there&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! So, what is happening exactly? How should we fix it?
We tried to change in the .whl file all global.logLevel mentions to logger.level, but we got a new error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Section logger must be one of _test, global
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So we just changed the date of depreciation to 2030-11-30 and it worked lol
But how can we fix it in a reasonable way?
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: 0.70.0
Python version: 3.6
Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? PyEnv

		You can just update your streamlit configuration settings. You can do that in the  file: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/streamlit_configuration.html#set-configuration-options&gt;https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/streamlit_configuration.html#set-configuration-options&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You need to make sure you have the global logging commented out, and add the logger section. Example ~/.streamlit/config.toml:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# Configure the ability to share apps to the cloud.
# Should be set to one of these values: - "off" : turn off sharing. - "s3" : share to S3, based on the settings under the [s3] section of this config file. - "file" : share to a directory on the local machine. This is meaningful only for debugging Streamlit itself, and shouldn't be used for production.
# Default: "off"
sharingMode = "off"

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true
showWarningOnDirectExecution = true

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
#
# DEPRECATED.
# global.logLevel has been replaced with logger.level
# This option will be removed on or after 2020-11-30.
#
#logLevel =

[logger]

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
level = "debug"

# String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set, logger messages will default to `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s`. See [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/logging.html#formatter-objects) for available attributes.
# Default: None
messageFormat = "%(asctime)s %(levelname) -7s %(name)s: %(message)s"

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kzecchini&gt;@kzecchini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is correct.
To add on, config options could also be set with environment variables or the CLI. If you are not sure where you are setting global.logLevel, you can do streamlit config show and it will list where each config option is being set from.
Closing as not a bug.
