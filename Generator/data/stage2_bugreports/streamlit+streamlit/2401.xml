	<summary>File uploader does not work on the first load</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When using the file uploader widget to upload a file on the first page load, streamlit does not detect that the file is uploaded and the subsequent code does not run at all. It works only after refreshing the page.
This is exactly the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1298&gt;#1298&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that was fixed in 0.57.3.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: 0.71.0
Python version: 3.8.6
OS version: Debian Buster (python:3.8.6-slim-buster Docker image)
Browser version: Chrome 86.0.4240.193

		Thanks for reporting the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hmoravec&gt;@hmoravec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! Unfortunately I'm not able to reproduce this on my machine    but we did make a couple of updates in version 0.72.0 that could impact this behavior you are seeing. Do you mind trying to upgrade to latest and see if this is still an issue for you? Alternatively, could you try this on our &lt;denchmark-link:https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/core-previews/tag-0.72.1.dev20201202&gt;0.72.0 playground here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
