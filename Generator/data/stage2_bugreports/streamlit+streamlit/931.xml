	<summary>Button inside button is resetting the page</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have a scenario where, when a button is pressed, it should perform some action and then a new button should appear for further actions. But, when the new button is pressed, the current page is getting completely reset. Sample code as shown below,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    if st.button("Button 1"):
        st.text("Button 1 pressed")
        if st.button("Button 2"):
            st.text("Button 2 pressed")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

With the above-mentioned code snippet,

Click on 'Button 1'
Displays message "Button 1 pressed" and Button 2 appears
Press 'Button 2' to reproduce the bug

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When 'Button 2' is pressed, the page should maintain previous information and execute further actions.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The complete page is getting reset.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No

		This is working as streamlit was designed, the code reruns from top to bottom after every action, in that new run it will only have access to the latest action. In your example after pushing button 2 it doesn remember pushing button 1 before that.
I guess you could do a ugly workaround like so:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if st.button("Button 1") | st.button("Button 2"):
  st.text("Button 1 pressed")
    if st.button("Button 2"):
      st.text("Button 2 pressed")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If you dont have too many steps in your button trail :)

		Thanks for the clarification.
I guess, above workaround is not working. Getting DuplicateWidgetID: There are multiple identical st.button widgets with the same generated key. error.
Anyways, got your point :)
