	<summary>Unable to create widget for path dialogue box</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using Ttinker package to get a path dialogue box to input as the file name, but it does not seem to support. Plz advice if there is a workaroud this.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import streamlit as st
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
root = tk.Tk()
root.withdraw()
file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename()
fname = st.text_input(file_path)
if fname != "":
st.write("Reading text file...", fname)
# code for file manipulation

		That's an interesting idea, mixing traditional GUI components with Streamlit apps. I hadn't considered that!
In your case, I can get rid of the error by assigning the root window in askopenfilename():
file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(master=root)
I don't fully understand Tkinter, though, so this was just a happy guess!
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Of course, the more Streamlit-y solution would be this one: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/120&gt;#120&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please vote on it if it's something you'd like to see implemented!

		A temporary work-around (if you want a file on the server) would be:
import streamlit as st
import os

def file_selector(folder_path='.'):
    filenames = os.listdir(folder_path)
    selected_filename = st.selectbox('Select a file', filenames)
    return os.path.join(folder_path, selected_filename)

filename = file_selector()
st.write('You selected `%s`' % filename)
Please see &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/upload-files-to-streamlit-app/80/2&gt;this topic&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more ideas!
