		HI &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sunilkusahoo&gt;@sunilkusahoo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I assume this issue refers to what you posted &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/importerror/2261/2&gt;in the forum here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where you say you are getting this error:

ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit_bz2)

Can you add some more detail to this issue?  we don't know enough about what you are experiencing to be able to help here.
We'll need to know what code you were running, what OS you're on, and what version of Python you're using.
Thanks!
