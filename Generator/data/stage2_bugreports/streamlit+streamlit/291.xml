	<summary>'from __future__' error running on python3.8rc1</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have installed streamlit using pip for python3.8rc1.
Upon running streamlit hello and visiting the localhost URL, I see the following in a web popup:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/streamlit/hello.py", line 18
  from __future__ import division, unicode_literals
  ^
SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning of the file
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Briefly looking at the source for this file, I do not understand what is causing the error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:

Install python3.8rc1 on macOS catalina.
pip3 install streamlit. Will require Developer Tools and fussing with pillow Zlib dependency.
Run streamlit hello.
Visit the page.

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: 0.47.4
Python version: Python 3.8.0rc1
Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? No.
OS version: macOS 10.15 Beta (19A582a)
Browser version: Safari Version 13.0.2 (15608.2.30.1.1)

		Python 3.8 doesn't work very well for me, but you can get it running by just removing the line above, like so: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/XBattleFan/streamlit/commit/6422cb07e66434f51d86540c5f083ca555532695&gt;XBattleFan@6422cb0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Fractals and plotting will work, none of the others.

		We have full python 3.8 support now, and we've dropped python 2 support.
