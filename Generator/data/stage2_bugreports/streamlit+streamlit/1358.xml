	<summary>Latest version doesn't work with SessionState()</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have just updated to the latest version of Streamlit, and when I tried to run one of the scripts that uses the SessionState() I got this error:
AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute '_session_infos'
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried with a simple script:
import streamlit as st
import SessionState
session = SessionState.get(hello=st.empty(), run_id=0)
session.hello.text_input('Enter a name', key=session.run_id)
session.run_id += 1
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I expected to be able to write something in the widget and then reset it
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following exception is thrown:
AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute '_session_infos'
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: 0.57.3
Python version: 3.7
Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex?: No
OS version: Windows 10
Browser version: Chrome version 80.0.3987.163 (Official Build) (64-bit)

		Have you tried using the last version of the st_state_patch gist?
I was facing the same problem and got it working after updating it.
