		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyunc&gt;@pyunc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I just tried that experiment and it is working fine for me, looking at your trace seems to be an enviroment problem in which plotly is no correctly installed, please try running streamlint within a new  and clean environment or you could try running pip install plotly
Let us know if this helps you!
