	<summary>Frontend: do something reasonable with handleMessage errors</summary>
	<description>
WebsocketConnection.handleMessage can throw errors for a variety of reasons. We're currently swallowing those errors, which leaves a running report in a broken state.
(We may want to just move to the "disconnected forever" state and tell the user that everything blew up.)
