	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

i am trying to write some piece of text and for new line i am using \n
the expected behaviour should be texts in multiple lines but what happens is after first line break the text is automatically gets into a uneditable textbox.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Try out this snipped:
st.subheader('Plug into nirvana')
st.write("""90% of people love to enjoy music, while they are working!\n
    are you one of them, we have a curated list of chillout tracks\n
    that may help you bring out the calmness in you.
    """)
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

text should be written with line breaks
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

line breaks are visible but the text goes into an uneditable textbox
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		there is a workaround to achieve my final goal i.e., using st.markdown with unsafe_allow_html=True
but since there is no gurantee of html support in future i don't want to go with this way.
st.subheader('Plug into nirvana')
st.markdown("""90% of people love to enjoy music, while they are working!&lt;br&gt;
    are you one of them, we have a curated list of chillout tracks&lt;br&gt;
    that may help you bring out the calmness in you.
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)
This works fine for me.

		I think this is because Markdown handles indented lines as a code block. You can try this to avoid indentation:
st.subheader('Plug into nirvana')
st.markdown(
    "90% of people love to enjoy music, while they are working!  \n"
    "are you one of them, we have a curated list of chillout tracks  \n"
    "that may help you bring out the calmness in you."
)
Two spaces in the end of the line create a line break in Markdown.
Or just use st.write
st.subheader('Plug into nirvana')
st.write(
    "90% of people love to enjoy music, while they are working!\n"
    "are you one of them, we have a curated list of chillout tracks\n"
    "that may help you bring out the calmness in you."
)

  thanks for the help, next time i'll use two spaces for the line break, though writing every line in "--" quotes is not very a efficient way.
