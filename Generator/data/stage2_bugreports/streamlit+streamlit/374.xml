	<summary>URLError "Unable to get local issuer certificate" when running the Uber NYC Demo</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

One of our users rand the Uber NYC Demo and saw the following error:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1673013/66634994-954c1780-ec0e-11e9-9649-3c6be14ea2c1.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After some digging around, this seems like &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52805115/certificate-verify-failed-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate&gt;an issue with some versions of Python on MacOS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
It can also be unsafely solved by setting  as described &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22027418/openssl-python-requests-error-certificate-verify-failed&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Possible Solutions&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Immediate Hack&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Some Googling suggests that &lt;denchmark-link:https://timonweb.com/tutorials/fixing-certificate_verify_failed-error-when-trying-requests_html-out-on-mac/&gt;this procedure&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 may work for make users. 
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Longer Term Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the long run, perhaps we can solve this issues by providing our own  and  as described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/375&gt;this feature request&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Update from that user. He had old SSL certificates installed. When he fixed that Streamlit worked! :) Nevertheless, I think it would be good if we tried to solve this for our users (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/375&gt;#375&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		Just for the sake of issue board cleanliness, I'm closing this bug since it's not really a problem with Streamlit per se.  The link from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/375&gt;#375&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which is still open will help provide context.

		I realize that this issue is closed, but I had the same problem and wanted to provide the requested information in case it is helpful.
Streamlit version: 0.56.0
Python version: 3.7.3
Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex?:  Pipenv
OS version: macOS Catalina 10.15.3
Browser version: Firefox 73.0.1 (64 bit)
My workaround was the download the CSV and use local paths to load it. Hopefully, I won't run into an SSL certificate problem when I try to build my own app, but if I do, you'll be hearing from me! :)
