	<summary>Regression: datepicker is broken when date is Epoch</summary>
	<description>
The first date input in e2e/scripts/st_sidebar.py is broken, but our screenshot tests didn't catch it since it's below the diff threshold ðŸ˜¢
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Here's what it looks like right now&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Notice that the date picker is disabled, for some reason!

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Here's what it's supposed to look like&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;This is the code in question&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

w1 = st.sidebar.date_input("Label 1", date(1970, 1, 1))
st.write("Value 1:", w1)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		The issue was due to the interpretation of the default min date 0001/01/01 being interpreted to be the year 2001. Change has been merged to ensure the date is always interpreted correctly.
