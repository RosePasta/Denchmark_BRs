	<summary>Load the recorded with cv2.VideoWrited video</summary>
	<description>
My object detection application has a field where the user inserts a link to the video and then the network detects the objects and should return the already processed video with objects and frames.
With the help of OpenCV I get video, use the neural network and re-record video with the help of VideoWriter. But when I return the video recorded with the help of VideoWriter I get only a black square instead of video.
I have tried different videos smaller than 50 megabytes.
What may be the problem ?

		The problem seems to be the wrong FOURCC. Who can tell which FOURCC to use to display the video in your browser ?

		My solution is not perfect, but I use ffmpeg and re-record the video in a different way.
os.system("ffmpeg -i docker/app/images/result.mp4 -vcodec libx264 docker/app/images/result_detection.mp4")
