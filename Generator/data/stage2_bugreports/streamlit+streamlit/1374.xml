	<summary>Matlplotlib has no attribute use</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

On a fresh install of Python 3.7.7 on Windows 10 installing streamlit alone with pip, the following line causes an the error matplotlib has no attribute use



streamlit/lib/streamlit/bootstrap.py


         Line 86
      in
      c2c950d






 matplotlib.use("Agg") 





I suspect this is because either streamlit itself, or a package streamlit depends upon mocks the matplotlib package if it doesn't happen to be installed there for the import matplotlib doesn't actually raise an ImportError
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

To fix, cause a pass to occur if matplotlib doesn't have the use attribute through another except block.

		No, I don't believe that post is relevant, but nevermind. I tried reproducing the issue within CI and was not successful:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SimonBiggs/streamlit/runs/617486029#step:7:7&gt;https://github.com/SimonBiggs/streamlit/runs/617486029#step:7:7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

As such, until I can better reproduce the issue I shall close this.
Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/arraydude&gt;@arraydude&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Cheers,
Simon
