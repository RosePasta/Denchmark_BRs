		HI &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ronamadthis&gt;@ronamadthis&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for trying out Streamlit!  Unfortunately I can't reproduce your bug; I just tried out the demo in streamlit 0.52 (current for when you filed this bug)  and in streamlit 0.53 (the latest as of today) without seeing the issue.
We'd like to try to reproduce the bug you're seeing.  To do so we'll need more information about the problem on your end.
Can you edit your bug report to include the following:

Which OS you're on
Which browser you're using
Which version of python you're using
Which version of Streamlit you have.

Thanks!

		We just merged in an improvement to the visibility of map dots (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1103&gt;#1103&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).  If this issue comes up again, please file a new bug!  Thanks!
