	<summary>streamlit on WSL in windows, running script always shows the demo on browser</summary>
	<description>
Good day,
I am using streamlist on WSL Ubuntu on windows,
installation went perfect.
Then I create a hello.py with some code following your tutorial,
then do streamlit run hello.py,
and instead of getting the result of the code, I get the streamlit demo page again on localhost:8501,
it always shows the demo, regardless of what script I run,
thank you
