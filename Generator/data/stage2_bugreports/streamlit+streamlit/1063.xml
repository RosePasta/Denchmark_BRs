&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Unable to run Streamlit app. Potential incompatibility with tornado or webbrower
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:

Tried Streamlit versions from 0.53 thorugh 0.55.
Keeping tornado==5.1.1

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It was running fine before. Can't figure out what steps led to it.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Exception in callback functools.partial(&lt;function wrap..null_wrapper at 0x7fe5c6f200e0&gt;)

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

That is, did this use to work the way you expected in the past?
yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: 0.53.0

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bballamudi&gt;@bballamudi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Are you trying to run Streamlit within Ipython Notebook?
Otherwise, can you make a list of the other python libraries you're trying to use side-by-side with Streamlit?
There are some known Tornado incompatibilities between Streamlit and other libraries.  From your error readout I don't think that's what's going on, but I'd like to be sure anyway.

		Actually, the bug looks like something to do with Python trying to use "xdg-settings" in a Windows environment, which is going to fail b/c Windows isn't an X server.
Could you post the contents of your streamlit app here?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nthmost&gt;@nthmost&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for the response. I had Pandas-profiling, plotly and regex along with streamlit. I am able to get through this issue with clean installation though. May be you can close it now? Thanks

 OK, interesting.  I wonder what the problem was?  Well, thanks for returning to the issue to comment!

		I'll try to post the details for reproducing it if I encounter it again which given my inexperience I likely will.
