	<summary>How to use Streamlit with generators ?</summary>
	<description>
I would like to use streamlit to visualize my data at different steps of my data-preprocess pipeline.
I'm using generators.
My goal is to be able to display data along the pipeline, and before going to the next sample, having a button next.
So sample are displayed one by one, and when clicking the button it displays the next sample.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried putting my generator into cache, but I receive an error (generators are not Hashable).
Also if someone met the same usecase, a little guidance would be greatly appreciated !

		Hi @Colanim , sorry for late reply!
If you upgrade to the latest version of Streamlit you'll be able to pass a custom hash_func to hash your generator. See example below.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import types
import streamlit as st

@st.cache(hash_funcs={types.GeneratorType: id})
def x():
   return (a for a in range(10))

st.write(list(x()))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

See &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.streamlit.io/advanced_caching.html#the-hash-funcs-parameter&gt;hash_funcs docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
