	<summary>Creating new/Updating text area getting DuplicateWidgetID error</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm trying to update a text area with new text by creating a placeholder and calling the placeholder.text_area() in a loop, this gives me the following error:
**DuplicateWidgetID: There are multiple identical st.text_area widgets with the same generated key.
(When a widget is created, it's assigned an internal key based on its structure. Multiple widgets with an identical structure will result in the same internal key, which causes this error.)**
It seems to work in 1 for loop and fail in the other, not sure why. Is there any other way to update text in text area control?
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi @jrhone,
I found a workaround, thanks!

Could you please elaborate your workaround? I am stuck on a similar problem.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jrhone&gt;@jrhone&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This draw method is scheduled to run every x seconds. My idea is, that I check if the "stop" button is checked every x seconds too. If the button is pressed, a method is called which cancels a subscription to a database.
I get the following error message:
DuplicateWidgetID: There are multiple identical st.button widgets with the same generated key.
I then tried to do the same with random keys (since I don't really need the key anyways) but that obviously just generates a bunch of new buttons.
I'd greatly appriceate any help, thanks!
`def draw(self):
with self.lock:
self.y_data.append([len(self.all_documents_changes)])
self.all_documents_changes.clear()
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    self.x_data.append([self.counter])
    self.p.line(self.x_data, self.y_data, line_width=2) 
    self.live_chart.bokeh_chart(self.p)                                             
    self.x_range_start += 1
    self.x_range_end += 1
    if (self.x_range_start % 10) == 0 :
        value = self.p.x_range.__class__(self.x_range_start-1, self.x_range_end)
        self.p.x_range = value  
    self.counter += 1
    
    if st.button("Stop"):
        self.aobserver()
    else:   
        self.s.enter(1, 1, self.draw)`
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 , sorry for the late reply!
I don't think I understand your example. Could you provide sample code that I can copy/paste and run in a report to reproduce your error?
Also could you file a new issue so that things don't get lost in this closed one?
