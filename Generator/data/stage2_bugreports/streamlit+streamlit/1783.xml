	<summary>Dates frontend is very slow - choosing a date is very slow and unresponsive</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Dates are very slow to manipulate inside the browser. Feels "buggy".
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Code app.py:
import streamlit as st

def main():
    st.date_input("date")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Then,
streamlit run app.py
Finally, try to manipulate with your cursor the date object inside your browser.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It should be fast to choose a date.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Interface is very slow and therefore hard to use
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: 0.64.1.dev20200728
Python version: Python 3.6.8
Using virtualenvwrapper
OS version: Ubuntu 18.04
Browser version: Mozilla Firefox 78.0.2

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vinzeebreak&gt;@vinzeebreak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I can't reproduce this using Chrome or Firefox, also using Ubuntu 18.04. Any chance your system resources like RAM are at 100% usage?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/randyzwitch&gt;@randyzwitch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Just tried again on my personal computer. My RAM was only 1/3 full and my CPU was completely fine.
OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Browsers: Mozilla Firefox 79.0 &amp; Google Chrome 84.0.4147.89
Python 3.6.8 &amp; 3.7.6
streamlit-nightly==0.64.1.dev20200728

Python 3.8.2
Mozilla Firefox 78.0.2 (64-bit)

		I tried to find which version introduced this bug:
❎ = bug seen
✔️ = no bug
pip install streamlit:
0.64.0: ❎
0.63.2: ✔️
pip install streamlit-nightly:
0.63.2.dev20200722 : ❎
0.63.2.dev20200721 : ✔️
I managed to find the commits between the 2 nightly versions:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/compare/0.63.2.dev20200722...0.63.2.dev20200721&gt;0.63.2.dev20200722...0.63.2.dev20200721&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I am puzzled.. The bug cannot come from this..
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/randyzwitch&gt;@randyzwitch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Are there any external files that are included inside the  that could introduce the bug?

		Thanks for looking into this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vinzeebreak&gt;@vinzeebreak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! There are no external files that are included as part of our release process. At first I was quite puzzled but I think we were just comparing the tags in reverse. Looking at this makes much more sense: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/compare/0.63.2.dev20200721...0.63.2.dev20200722&gt;0.63.2.dev20200721...0.63.2.dev20200722&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It's very probable this is a regression caused by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/1747&gt;#1747&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Just tested again today on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 with streamlit==0.71.0 and it works like a charm!

		Great, thanks for confirming! Closing this issue, but if you think there's more to do, happy to re-open it.
