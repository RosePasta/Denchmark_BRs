	<summary>dataframe styling breaks on pandas &amp;gt;= 1.1.0</summary>
	<description>
Pandas just released v1.1.0, and our styling code (which uses private pandas methods) is incompatible with it.
(As a temporary workaround, we're pinning pandas to &lt; 1.1.0.)
When this is fixed, we should remove the restriction on pandas &lt; 1.1.0 from the Streamlit Pipfile

I have discovered a truly remarkable solution which this comment is too narrow to contain.

On a serious note, I'll try to send out a PR by the end of the week.
