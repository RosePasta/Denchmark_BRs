	<summary>Issue in Uber demo</summary>
	<description>
Reported by a user: Today I was trying to run the Uber App tutorial and faced issue about python-dateutil version 2.8.1. The latest python-dateutil version is 2.8.1 and the supported one in streamlit is &lt;=2.8.0. So I tried with 2.8.0 and it worked fine.

		This isn't an issue with an Uber demo; it's an issue with the  dependency: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/1872&gt;boto/botocore#1872&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
