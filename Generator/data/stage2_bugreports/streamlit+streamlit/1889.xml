	<summary>baseUrlPath ignored by assets</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When setting --server.baseUrlPath="st/", I'd expect static asset requests to be st/assets/, but requests seem to be for /assets for iconic portions:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4249447/90448247-d9fbd700-e099-11ea-8f53-3fdca687105e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

There seems to be some back-and-forth repeat regressions on this, e.g, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1725&gt;#1725&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Within the page, there does not seem to be any base path tag in the &lt;head&gt;, making this more fun
The iconic resources do appear to be getting served on localhost:8501/st/assets/..., but in-browser requests are to localhost:8501/assets.
We're also struggling with the workaround of redirecting /assets -&gt; /st/assets at the reverse proxy layer, but unclear if that's on our side or something in server strictness settings. We have enableCORS = false but otherwise vanilla, and current bet is our proxy.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:
Run with --server.baseUrlPath="st/"
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Default page loads
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

See above -- many assets load, but Iconic related seem to fail
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We've been trying to get this to work, so unclear
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: latest stable - 0.62.2
Python version: 3.7
Using Conda? pip installed
OS version: ubuntu 18.04 (docker)
Browser version: chrome

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Additional information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We're trying to prove out streamlit for enterprise dashboarding, so doing a standard-ish customer-controlled auth bastion + URL -&gt; reverse proxy -&gt; streamlit dockers for a subpath

		Ah, closing -- this seems to have been some silent failures leading to running an older version than what our config specified, apologies!
