	<summary>"All arguments must be of the same type" exception checks the type of argument step, but doesn't report on its type</summary>
	<description>
Problem
The line st.sidebar.number_input("test", 0.0, 100.0, step=1) produces this Exception which is not quite informative enough to let the user know that the type of step needs to be the same as all the rest of the arguments:
StreamlitAPIException: All arguments must be of the same type. value has float type. min_value has float type. max_value has float type.
Expected Behavior The exception text should include the type of step to inform the user of what went wrong.
Current Behavior  The exception doesn't mention the type of step, leading the user to have to guess what went wrong.
