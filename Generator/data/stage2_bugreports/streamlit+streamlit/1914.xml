	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

My application is running forever and also freezes up and down scrolling.  The cmd window displays Discarding ScriptRequest.RERUN request after shutdown and other errors.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33131958/91091546-95c58500-e60b-11ea-9ee3-5475d63636f0.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

What are the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:
Interact with file_uploader
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

File_uploader would upload files
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Explain the buggy behavior you experience when you go through the steps above.
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Yes, no change in code, now there is an error.

		I have also noticed that a similar app that uses the same virtual environment runs fine, but in this case I am uploading a kml file instead of a txt file, perhaps that has something to do with it?
As for the Matplotlib error, I removed and reinstalled matplotlib and that particular warning message has gone away.

		Turns out my user was just uploading the wrong file.  No issues here.
