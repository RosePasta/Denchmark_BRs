	<summary>The DataFrame demo in `streamlit hello` requires a more recent Pandas version than Streamlit does</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We watched a user run streamlit hello and see it fail in the dataframe example because Pandas.isna() wasn't defined.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Install an old version of Pandas. (Sorry, we don't have a record of what it was.)
Go to the dataframe demo in streamlit hello

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

An exception is thrown because pd.isna() wasn't defined.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The demo should work beautifully, of course ;)
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This was not recorded unfortunately, although it maybe worth noting that this user had pip installed Streamlit into a Conda environment.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We need to figure out the minimum version of Pandas which has isna(). Ways to solve this:

Look up that function and figure out when it was introduced.
(Safer!) install progressively earlier versions of Python and run the dataframe demo until we can find the incompatible version.

It's missing in &lt;denchmark-link:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/api.html#top-level-missing-data&gt;0.20&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
