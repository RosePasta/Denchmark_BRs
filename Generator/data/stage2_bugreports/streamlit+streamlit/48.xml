	<summary>"Always Run" takes effect only after the Streamlit Window/tab is selected</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When editing code and saving in my IDE with Always Run enabled, the rerun is not immediately kicked off, but it seems I have to click on the Streamlit UI in the browser.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Enable 'Always RUn'
Edit a script in an IDE (I was using PyCharm for this)
Keep the 'focus' on the IDE, but look at the Streamlit UI, possibly on another monitor or on some other part of the screen

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I expect to see the Streamlit UI re-generate the results every time I save.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Nothing happens on the UI. If click on the UI, the computation starts and results are regenerated.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Is this a regression?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

That is, did this use to work the way you expected in the past?
N/A
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Debug info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Streamlit version: Streamlit v0.45.0
Python version: 3.7.4
Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex?
OS version: MacOs 10.14.6
Browser version: Chrome  76.0.3809.100

		Had the same problem under windows, when editing through atom (Got a question for re-run after every page reload)

		Possible same problem as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/961&gt;#961&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This is no longer an issue on VS Code and PyCharm. Looks like we fixed it!
