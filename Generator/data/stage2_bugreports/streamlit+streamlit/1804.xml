		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/datalee&gt;@datalee&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the report. This proved to be a really interesting find. It turns out that Google Chrome (and I assume MS Edge) requires the server to support &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests&gt;Range Requests&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in order to allow this feature in videos. I have a solution in the works, but there is one detail in our architecture that breaks that we need to figure out a solution. I'm working towards getting that answer so I can implement this.
Some other things I noticed:

This seems to work under Firefox. They are probably really forgiving if you need to showcase something with precision.
Videos flat out do not work on Safari. Supporting Range Requests will fix this.
The only workaround is to provide a URL to a server that supports range requests for the video. It's not ideal, but I did test it and it does work.

Here's the &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1018533#c15&gt;conversation on Chromium&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for further information.

		The change has been merged in and will be in the next release. There should be an improvement to everything above.
