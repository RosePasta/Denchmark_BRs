	<summary>Did not auto detect external IP</summary>
	<description>
This occurred right after I upgraded streamlit to version 0.52.1.
This happens every time I try to run streamlit. The below error resulted from running streamlit hello in a docker container.
Did not auto detect external IP.
Please go to &lt;denchmark-link:https://streamlit.io/docs/&gt;https://streamlit.io/docs/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for debugging hints.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/seriouslyez&gt;@seriouslyez&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I've just tried with new docker container with ubuntu 18.04 and it's working fine for me, do you have the steps to replicate this?

 ?

		So I thought this happened because I upgraded streamlit to 0.52.1. However, when I tested this on my ubuntu image 18.04 outside the docker it works fine. Within docker, I tried downgrading back to 0.50.2 but I received the same error, even when trying to run streamlit hello, let alone running my own file.

		I have the same error when I am connected to the internet using my home internet router. And also when I am not connected to the internet.
If I am connected to the internet via my phone using a wifi hotspot streamlit works.
I am running on Docker Ubuntu 18.04.
Why does connecting to a different network change streamlit if I am running locally?

		Looks like another instance of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/554&gt;#554&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Marking as dupe. Please reopen if you think this is not correct.
