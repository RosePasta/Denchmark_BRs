	<summary>Metrics can't access params from current step</summary>
	<description>
The metrics are currently computed before the step call which means that the value of model parameters (useful for dynamic programming problems) is actually 'yesterdays' value. Can probably, seamlessly move the metric computation to after the step call but before the callback 'on_step_training' but needs a thorough check.
