	<summary>Ordering of with_generators arguments</summary>
	<description>
I hope I'm not being a nuisance by putting in an issue for this, but I was wondering if I could put in a PR for the argument ordering of with_generators to make it consistent with for_steps.
Currently, to load generators, I have to write:
trial.with_generators(trL, val_generator=deL, test_generator=teL)
It would be nice if I could instead write the following, especially since there's already a for_steps function that take in the train_steps, val_steps, and test_steps arguments in between the generator arguments:
trial.with_generators(trL, deL, teL)
Please let me know if this sounds reasonable, and again, I hope I'm not being a bother by making this suggestion.

		That sounds reasonable, arguments should ideally be consistent with the for_steps method. Happy for you to open a PR :)
