	<summary>lr_scheduler order changed since PyTorch 1.1.0</summary>
	<description>
Many thanks for the wonderful library.
A warning message emerged when a scheduler was used in the callbacks:
scheduler = torchbearer.callbacks.torch_scheduler.StepLR(step_size=5, gamma=0.1)
Hope it could be considered in later update if not yet included.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Python37\lib\site-packages\torch\optim\lr_scheduler.py:100: UserWarning: Detected call of `lr_scheduler.step()` before `optimizer.step()`. In PyTorch 1.1.0 and later, you should call them in the opposite order: `optimizer.step()` before `lr_scheduler.step()`.  Failure to do this will result in PyTorch skipping the first value of the learning rate schedule.See more details at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate
