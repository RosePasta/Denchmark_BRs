	<summary>Allow manually control the parameters of tqdm</summary>
	<description>
Currently tqdm can't work correctly on Windows console(see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm#faq-and-known-issues&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

Windows consoles often only partially support unicode and thus often require explicit ascii=True. This is due to either normal-width unicode characters being incorrectly displayed as "wide", or some unicode characters not rendering.

Please provide a way to control the parameters of tqdm(e.g. set ascii=True). Thanks for your work!

		Thanks for your issue. Should be fixed when &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorchbearer/torchbearer/pull/325&gt;#325&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 gets merged. In order to pass ascii=True, set verbose=0 in the fit call and from torchbearer.callbacks import Tqdm, then give Tqdm as a callback to the fit call. Hope that helps!
