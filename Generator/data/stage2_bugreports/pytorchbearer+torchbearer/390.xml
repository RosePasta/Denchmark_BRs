	<summary>Model resuming not working</summary>
	<description>
Loading in a state dict isn't working for me. It seems to be due to the StateKey objects not checking for proper equality. Maybe because the model was saved on a different machine? Perhaps we should use strings for keys in the state_dicts to deal with this?
