	<summary>optional dependencies?</summary>
	<description>
The package currently depends on  and .  These are both pretty hefty dependencies, and they don't appear to be necessary for the core functionality.  Maybe it'd be worth making them optional (e.g., like here in :  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/4b55fa4871cf3f1dbd2e30bfe00d80df87d4b340/statsmodels/graphics/utils.py#L9&gt;https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/4b55fa4871cf3f1dbd2e30bfe00d80df87d4b340/statsmodels/graphics/utils.py#L9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		Thanks for poining this out, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mheilman&gt;@mheilman&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! Actually, the matplotlib one is a relic and should be taken out entirely. I agree that the scikit-image one should be made optional.
I'll do after this weekend unless of course I see a PR come in ;)

		just a thought I had when installing it.  I'd have just made a PR but wasn't sure exactly why those dependencies were there.
