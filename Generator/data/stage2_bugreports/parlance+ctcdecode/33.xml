	<summary>Incorrect maintaining of states for words?</summary>
	<description>
One of our colleagues got in touch with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/willfrey&gt;@willfrey&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and he mentioned an issue with the pytorch-ctc implementation:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;He pointed out that the scorer in pytorch-ctc wasn't maintaining state between words properly, rendering it a "spell checker" (only scoring unigrams basically)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'll do some investigation into this claim and report back!
