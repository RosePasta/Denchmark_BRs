	<summary>What is the requirements for the data folder</summary>
	<description>
When I try to import data, I have this problem. My folder contain sub folder for each class. I am not sure if there are other requirements for the data folder. If there is any requirements for the data folder, could you please inform me of it
ERROR: no images added

		So, there's a little tooltip next to the input field that says this:

Indicate a folder which holds subfolders full of images. Each subfolder should be named according to the desired label for the images that it holds. Can also be a URL for an apache/nginx auto-indexed folder.

That's admittedly a little cryptic. I used to have more detailed instructions on there, but they were cluttering up the page. Here is the folder layout that DIGITS is looking for:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/path/to/images/
â”œâ”€â”€ cat
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 1.jpg
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 2.JPEG
â””â”€â”€ dog
    â”œâ”€â”€ 01.png
    â””â”€â”€ 02.jpeg
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, you would enter /path/to/images in the "training images" field, and DIGITS would find two subfolders, "cat" and "dog," and use those as category names. Each category would have two images in it. Obviously, you'll want more than two images per category ðŸ˜‰

		Ok, then there might be something else going wrong. I'm filing this as a bug for poor error-catching. I have plans for improving the error catching in this area, so that you get a better idea of what's going wrong.
In the meantime, what is your Pillow version? Run this: pip list | grep pillow -i. You should see that Pillow is at least 2.3.0. I've seen someone with an outdated version run into an issue like yours.

This is the bug I was getting.
I am running Pillow (2.3.0)

		I finnally manage to import my files. The problem with it is that I use the original caffe for digits when I switch to NVIDIA/caffe it works perfectly.
Caffe is changing alot, do you have any plan to flow up on the changes or just keep the NVIDIA/caffe as it is now

		Is it possible to create dataset from .bmp images?
I've just tried, but failed with error: "ERROR: Did not find two valid categories".

Is it possible to create dataset from .bmp images?

Image formats other than JPEG and PNG are not currently supported. But it is trivial to add support for more. I'm opening a new issue for this, as it is unrelated to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ducminhnguyen&gt;@ducminhnguyen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's problem.

		Just wondering if 16bit PNGs are also accepted? Thanks.

		I haven't tried it myself, but DIGITS should load the images just fine. However, they will be converted to 8-bits before saving to the database or passing to caffe for testing. See here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/v1.1.0/digits/utils/image.py#L125-L126&gt;https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/v1.1.0/digits/utils/image.py#L125-L126&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is that a problem? Would you like to work with 16-bit data? Have you done that with caffe before?

		Shouldn't be a huge issue (i think). I am using it for medical images (DICOM), which tend to be 16 bit greyscale. Good to know. I'll probably stick to 8bit.
