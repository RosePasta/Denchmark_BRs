	<summary>Error: status == CUDNN_STATUS_SUCCESS (8 vs. 0)  CUDNN_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED</summary>
	<description>
I am getting this error when trying to run training with my custom network.
status == CUDNN_STATUS_SUCCESS (8 vs. 0)  CUDNN_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED
I found this post that refers to this error:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/1700#issuecomment-133476490&gt;BVLC/caffe#1700 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But it doesn't specify where or how to fix it. Also I am not sure if the issues are related or something completely different. Let me mention that this custom framework works perfectly fine when I run it in my local caffe install, and I can also see all the nodes if I hit the visualize button. It starts training and fails after the first epoch.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alfredox10&gt;@alfredox10&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you tell me which versions you are using of DIGITS, Caffe, cuDNN and CUDA?
Also, can you show me the last dozen lines or so of your raw Caffe output? That may provide a stacktrace which can help us zero in on the issue.

Digits-2.0rc, CUDA 7.0, Caffe is coming from inside DIGITS which is the 0.13 NVIDIA branch, CuDNN v1

What do you mean by "Caffe is coming from inside DIGITS"? Did you build Caffe yourself with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/digits-2.0/docs/InstallCaffe.md&gt;these instructions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, or did you use the &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.nvidia.com/digits&gt;web installer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
If you did build from source, Caffe v0.13 expects cuDNN v3. Maybe that's your problem?

		I built it via the web installer, so there is a Caffe folder inside the DIGITS folder.

, sorry about the delay. This bug got lost in the pile.
I'm running your network and still not seeing any issues. I'm using 256x256 images - should I be using something else?
Do you get the same errors when using one of the standard networks?

Which GPU[s] do you have?

		I use a 780 Ti. Ok well let me try this again soon with the same network
and with the standard ones. I just upgraded my machine to nvidia driver
352, CUDA 7.5, Caffe 0.13 nvidia branch, and CuDNN v3, and I'll see if i'm
still having those same issues.

		No I was never able to solve it, I went back to using Caffe by itself for training. Going to try to figure out if I can run multiple GPU training using Caffe 0.13, is there a guide on how to set it up to do that?

		You don't really have to set up anything. Just &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/v2.2.1/docs/InstallCaffe.md&gt;install Caffe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and select more than one GPU when creating your model:

		Well this is great, but I can't use the caffemodel from DIGITS because it doesn't output the same data structure as the caffemodel produced when manually training with Caffe from the terminal. So I'm just using Caffe by itself, I meant what is the additional command needed to run Caffe from the terminal in multi-GPU way? Right now I'm running it like this due to some bug that doesn't set to GPU 0 if not specified.

It should. Can you explain the difference you're seeing?

some bug that doesn't set to GPU 0 if not specified.

Same as this issue? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/issues/23&gt;NVIDIA/caffe#23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		For manually running multiple GPUs, list the device ordinals you want to use, e.g. instead of 0 you can use 0,1

		Yes same as issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/issues/23&gt;NVIDIA/caffe#23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, however when I made those changes to the code in the 0.13 branch, it returned type errors, so I just set it manually and that fixed it. Ok thanks guys! I'll try it and let ya'll know if that works. Once I test that I may try to reuse the DIGITS caffemodel output, I'll come back here and show you guys what it's producing, because it does not give me the same predict model with 'ip2' and 'labels' as keys.

		I received two errors when trying to run the -gpu all and the -gpu 0,1 command.

Also how do you enable multi-gpu when you are using the train file to perform detections? I know there is the caffe.set_mode_gpu() command, is there another to enable both GPUs?

		Sorry, I gave you the wrong information before. With NVcaffe v0.12 and v0.13, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/blob/v0.13.2/tools/caffe.cpp#L23-L27&gt;we went with the flags&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 proposed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cypof&gt;@cypof&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in his original multi-GPU pull request (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/2114&gt;BVLC/caffe#2114&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;DEFINE_int32(gpu, -1,
    "Run in GPU mode on given device ID (Legacy switch, use -gpus).");
DEFINE_string(gpus, "",
    "Run in GPU mode on given device IDs separated by ','."
    "Use '-gpus all' to run on all available GPUs.");
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

With v0.14, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/blob/v0.14.0-beta/tools/caffe.cpp#L31-L34&gt;we are switching to the flags&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that BVLC actually merged into their fork:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;DEFINE_string(gpu, "",
    "Optional; run in GPU mode on given device IDs separated by ','."
    "Use '-gpu all' to run on all available GPUs. The effective training "
    "batch size is multiplied by the number of devices.");
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What you want is --gpus=0,1, not --gpu=0,1.
Again, you should be able to see this for yourself with caffe --help.

It looks like you've added a new issue for this at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/issues/43&gt;NVIDIA/caffe#43&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 there are a lot of divergent issues in this thread. I'm going to close this issue. Please re-open a new issue for any remaining against DIGITS or Caffe as appropriate.
