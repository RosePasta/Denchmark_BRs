	<summary>Image visualization</summary>
	<description>
With torch, images are fed into the network as BGR (I assume), but RGB convention when displaying intermediate results, so intermediate results show up in false colors.
To show the issue, I created a network with just one multiply(1) layer, here's the inference result:

		Thanks for the bug report Marco. Torch receives data in RGB order. Caffe receives them in BGR order. Since the visualization routine was originally written for Caffe it is doing an unnecessary conversion from BGR to RGB in the Torch case. The issue should be fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/722&gt;#722&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can you try please?
Thanks!
