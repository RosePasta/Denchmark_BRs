	<summary>requirements for webinstall ubuntu 14.04 (grpahViz, cuDNN)</summary>
	<description>
I have been working through a successful web-install on clean ubuntu 14.04
The requirements only stated to have driver 346 - so I haven't downloaded cuDNN or graphviz
When I attempt to visualize a network (visualize button ) when building a model
&lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7809322/7074866/58d24962-dec3-11e4-8944-ca976de446b9.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I return this error
&lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7809322/7074876/729ef818-dec3-11e4-93a3-d4ba37f44dc7.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Do i need to get graphviz and cuDNN on my own?
Thanks and my apologies if this is the wrong place for this question.  Great work

		Ah, it looks like we left out a line in the "one_time.sh" script. I'll make sure that's fixed for the next packaged version. Thanks for reporting it!
For now, if you want to use the visualization tool, you can manually run this command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sudo apt-get install graphviz
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
