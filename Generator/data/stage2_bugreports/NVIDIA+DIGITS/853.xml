	<summary>Job sorting is bugged</summary>
	<description>
Using: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/commit/99e2c46fa4babd2e278f6551c9f779e127119b77&gt;99e2c46&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Whenever I sort the Digits homepage, some jobs always stay at a given position.
See screenshots for example.

		Even after a fresh reload? I've had this but only when jobs went from Running Jobs table to the Model table.

		Reload doesn't change anything - but switching to Firefox (I'm using Chrome) fixes it.
Probably a cache issue then.
Actually I performed a "Empty cache and hard reload" but the problem persisted.

		I'm running up-to-date browsers and have had no trouble. Yesterday, I ran on Firefox 40 and an older chrome and saw this problem.  I think it may be a few changes to javascript. I will verify that browser age is the issue and change the code to run in older browsers.
In which browser and version are you seeing this broken sorting? Are there any warnings / errors in the console?

		It looks like chrome was a late adopter of some of the js1.7 features, namely the let keyword. I will change let to var to see if that fixes it.

Chrome, both on Windows and Linux. Windows is version 51.0.2704.84 m
Linux I can't check until monday.
In console I get the following errors:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot match against 'undefined' or 'null'.removePlaceholder @ content.js:463releaseElement @ content.js:517removed.forEach.el @ content.js:609(anonymous function) @ content.js:609

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I tried with the current chrome, and I'm still seeing the issue. Changing the js let to var fixed the issue I was seeing in the old Firefox.  I'll have to keep looking into chrome.
