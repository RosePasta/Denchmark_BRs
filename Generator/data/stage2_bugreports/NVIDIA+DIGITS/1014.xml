 Disable button
 Put whitespace after the word 'selected'
 Specify 'related files'

What do the 'related files' encompass?
I guess for deleting a dataset that means deleting all models.
When deleting models, does that then remove pretrained models?

		Well spotted Tim!
When a job is deleted the corresponding job directory is deleted. An error is dropped if you attempt to delete a dataset that has models associated to it. If a model is created from a pre-trained model then deleting the job does not delete the pre-trained model.

		Ah, I see. In that case i think the second warning line is redundant, or change it to say it cannot be reverted/un-done. Grouping is really handy though. If I had to whine I'd say the (location of the) 'Use grouping' checkbox hurts my Feng shui.
