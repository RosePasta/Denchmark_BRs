	<summary>Transpose order needs to have the same number of dimensions as input</summary>
	<description>
This error (explained in the title), keeps getting thrown when using the example scripts "Example.py" and "Use_Archive.py", contained in the DIGITS directory. I think it could be a bug with the underlying caffe system, but im not sure, so i have flagged the issue on the caffe git aswell, just incase.
Anyways, here's a copy of the stack trace that gets thrown on error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;dev@SaveHive:~/DIGITS/examples/classification$ python use_archive.py BeastNet_E200.gz 01.jpg

    raise Exception('Transpose order needs to have the same number of '
Exception: Transpose order needs to have the same number of dimensions as the input.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Any and all help appreciated as per usual!

		Update: Running the same script against an AlexNet model runs fine - Could this be an incompatibility problem with GoogleNet models &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lukeyeager&gt;@lukeyeager&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?

		Ah, I forgot to update the example after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/231&gt;#231&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can you verify that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/311&gt;#311&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes the issue for you?
