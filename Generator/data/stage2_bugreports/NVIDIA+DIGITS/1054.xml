	<summary>Validation images with no objects</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I was trying to create a validation object detection dataset which contains images with no objects. First i tried to create it using empty label files, but digits gave me the error ""Label key 0000 not found in label folder".
I handled this issue by adding a "dummy" label for these images. But i think this is not the best solution.

		Hello, what would be a better solution? It seems reasonable to me to expect one label file per image. You can have empty label files.

		I agree it is reasonable to have a label file per image. But i provide empty label files and it gives the error "Label key 0000 not found in label folder".
Since using empty label files didn't work, I added the following dummy line in each label file:
"dummy 0.0 0 0.0 0 0 1 1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0"
