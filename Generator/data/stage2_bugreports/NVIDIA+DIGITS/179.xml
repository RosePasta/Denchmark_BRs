	<summary>Configuration errors not saved in log</summary>
	<description>
When running DIGITS as a service, the server fails silently on an invalid configuration file. Nothing is printed in the log, so the user doesn't know what went wrong.
The trick is, we load the logfile location from the config file. So, we need to:

Read the config file[s] for a logfile location
Set the logfile
Check the other configuration options
If something is invalid:

If running digits-devserver, prompt the user for a valid value
If running digits-server, log the error before killing the script

		Fixed in deb packaging by piping stderr to the log.
