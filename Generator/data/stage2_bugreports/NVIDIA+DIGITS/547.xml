		Which version of DIGITS are you using? This was fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/534&gt;#534&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ ./digits-devserver --version
3.2-dev

$ git describe
v3.1.0-12-ga95b89e
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Can I input two step values? Means step down at 6%, and then step down again at 50%.
I tried "6.50" it does not work.

		Aha, now I see what you're saying! Sorry, I should have read your OP more carefully. That does look like a bug. Hang on a minute ...

		Wow you found a bug that was present in the initial commit for this repository. Apparently nobody has ever used this feature before - hah!
Thanks for the bug report. Fix is at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/549&gt;#549&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - I'll merge when the TravisCI build passes.

		If it's any comfort, it has never worked for Torch either :-)
