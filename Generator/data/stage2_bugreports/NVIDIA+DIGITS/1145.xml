	<summary>Digits in CPU Mode</summary>
	<description>
When I run Digits in cpu mode to do the tutorial of kitti-data, I got this Error Message below:
ERROR: Check failed: error == cudaSuccess (29 vs. 0) driver shutting down
It seems the model has been trained and it worked too.
What does the Error Message mean ?
PS: cuda-version is 8.0

		I think it's a Caffe bug - something in a destructor somewhere. Feel free to open a bug over at NVIDIA/caffe if it's a problem.
