	<summary>Status of dataset and trained model "Aborted"</summary>
	<description>
I followed the getting started guide and created a dataset for the mnist_10k images and sucessfully trained the default lenet. After stopping the server and starting it up again the status for my dataset and trained model changes to "Aborted".

		To be clear - both your dataset and model jobs completed before you restarted the server?
If so, that's a bug that I've noticed on another machine, but not on mine. Thanks for reporting this issue, I'll look into it and get back to you.

		I just used the DIGIT installer. If I can get it to compile from the source I'll verify it for you. Will installing DIGITS from source give me any problems if I already have it installed using the easy installer?
