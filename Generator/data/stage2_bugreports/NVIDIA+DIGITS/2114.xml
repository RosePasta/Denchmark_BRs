		I checked in folder /home/nvidia/DIGITS/digits/jobs/20180926-224358-dda9/.  There is a file named status.pickle.tmp.  I changed that file's name into 'status.pickle'.  now I have another error.

		Getting same issue on a different model. Same behavior where job has a file status.pickle.tmp, so I get an IO error where the status.pickle file is not found.

		Just to indicate that I also encountered this problem and solution for me seems to be the patch by uhfband referenced in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/issues/2024&gt;#2024&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		For all:
You need to install DIGTIS strictly by its document.
Web pages related are shown as follows:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildProtobuf.md&gt;https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildProtobuf.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildCaffe.md&gt;https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildCaffe.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildDigits.md&gt;https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/BuildDigits.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In summary, you need to install protobuf3 firstly, then install caffe from NVIDIA, then install DIGITS.
In this order, your DIGITS will test image successfully.
