	<summary>Segmentation visualization banding</summary>
	<description>
When viewing inference results with the segmentation option, many images have banding or bullseye patterns on areas of a class that should be contiguous. This has happened on multiple network designs.
Has anyone seen this happen?
In this case the proper inference would be all red class:

This is mask copied from the visualization page:

Another example of the mask from a different image, but over a black background. The white areas should be a contiguous block:

		Thanks for the great visualizations!

 can you check please?

		my inference results have the same phenomenon, also don't know why. I guess it is relevant with the deconvolution layer.

		I see this banding effect on the master branch but not on the release 5.0 branch: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/tree/digits-5.0&gt;https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/tree/digits-5.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can everybody confirm?

		I will look at this today. It looks like it's modulating. Is the data normalized?

		I see it on 5.1-dev

		I noticed that by adjusting the mask slider on the inference results page, the areas that should be masked begin to appear as the the mask percentage is increased.

 should fix it. It's a simple fix that will fix the banding, but simply clamps the alpha channel which is used for adjusting the tolerance in the binary segmentation.  It was wrapping every 256 pixels in distance from the isosurface.

, have a look?

		Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/1531&gt;#1531&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - thanks Joe!
