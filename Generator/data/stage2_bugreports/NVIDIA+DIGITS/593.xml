	<summary>Problems with relative server paths</summary>
	<description>
Reported by @gheinrich at #586 (comment)
When selecting files for upload, the file auto-completion is relative to the CWD of the DIGITS server (i.e.  or ). But when the files are actually used, they are relative to the jobs directory (since the subprocess CWD &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/v3.0.0/digits/task.py#L206&gt;is altered&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
We should probably just disallow relative paths in general.
