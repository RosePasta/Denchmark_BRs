	<summary>Classifying many images is not working the same as one at a time</summary>
	<description>
We are seeing different results when trying to classify many images listed in a file as opposed to doing each one individually.  Doing them one at a time gets very accurate results, but when supplying a list of those same test images, many are classified wrong.  The model is only looking for 2 cases.  Either it is a target item or not one.

		So I just pulled the latest version and ran that side by side with the older 2.0 version on our DIGITS-devbox.  The results were the same.  I'm still seeing cars in the list that are classified as not-being cars, yet when I test that individual image against the model, it comes up as a car with 99+% accuracy.  This makes it very hard to verify results when we are questioning the validity of the classify multiple images results.

 I forgot that we only partially fixed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/issues/255&gt;#255&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/261&gt;#261&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Can you verify that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/361&gt;#361&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes your issue?
