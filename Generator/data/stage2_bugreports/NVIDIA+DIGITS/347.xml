	<summary>Error when fine-tuning Caffe model using DIGITS</summary>
	<description>
Hi developers,
I am sorry, if I am posting in the wrong place. I searched user group, but did not find any clues. So, I report a bug here.
When I started fine-tuning a model using  model, I followed tutorials of using Caffe to fine-tune  dataset. If I use Caffe, it was running fine, but it is hard to visualize the loss values. So, I decided to use DIGITS to fine tune my models on my data. The differenc is that I use the latest version of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS&gt;DIGITS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe&gt;NVIDIA-Caffe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to do fine-tuning.
Then it generates this error

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lukeyeager&gt;@lukeyeager&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I downloaded again the caffe model from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/scripts/download_model_binary.py&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 provided in the latest Caffe. The error is still the same. It did not progress after few minutes, so I aborted them.

		Can you post the raw caffe log? I suspect it may just be really slow to respond.

This is my caffe log file [http://pastebin.com/DaC8WNLD]. I observe that  is as the same as previous time.

How big is your dataset? 9 minutes seems like it should be plenty long enough to get some kind of a response, but if you're trying to train on all of ImageNet with a small GPU, I can see how the validation pass might take longer than that.
Can you try fine-tuning on a small dataset? Have you been able to use DIGITS to train any other model successfully on your machine?

 Hi,
For your information, I did training and following tutorial for NVIDIA Deep Learning course [https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning-courses]. It was successful with DIGITS in my local machine with NVIDIA-Caffe 0.12. I never did fine-tune with DIGITS before. Then I upgrade NVIDIA-Caffe to master branch and this error happened.
From what I read from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/issues/41&gt;NVIDIA/caffe#41&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it looks like the problem with post-0.12 version of NVIDIA-Caffe.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lukeyeager&gt;@lukeyeager&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I can confirm that the same thing happened when fine-tuning even on the latest version of BVLC-Caffe. After a few iterations, Caffe will shutdown my workstation. I have repeated the errors multiple times and still don't know why. I might be because of my train_val.prototxt file or Caffe binary model . I do not why I succeeded in the first time.
I will try to localize the problem and report this error to Caffe developers.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lukeyeager&gt;@lukeyeager&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I took your advice and tried fine-tuning on Flickr example provided in Caffe. Something serious problem occurred in my computer.
Could you please execute for me the Flickr fine-tune examples in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/tree/master/examples/finetune_flickr_style&gt;NVIDIA-Caffe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/examples/finetune_flickr_style&gt;BLVC-Caffe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
Whenever I run it, after sometimes, it will restart my workstation whether I run it on CPU or GPU. Please help me to confirm whether it is the same on your machine.
Thanks,

		I have meet the same problem as

And after a short time waiting, the ubuntu system shutted down.
I had do a lot of trys, the problem is still not solved.

I have same error, but the different is my ubuntu did not shut down. Do you guys already know how to fix this problem? I am using the caffe I downloaded one week ago.

Sorry, I did not close this issue previously. After sometime, I figured out that the restarting problem is related to power issues. It might be that your workstation does not support enough power for GPUs (i.e., in my cases, Titan X).
Please check your power issues, power cables, and try disable &lt;denchmark-link:http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/increase-performance-gpu-boost-k80-autoboost/&gt;GPU auto-boost&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if it does not solve your problem.
Here is my summarization of how to set up proper workstation for Deep Learning &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1McEMHewtMOwhIyUSO_2AZxbeEwRihjF2Ql_eYQ6bq2o&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1McEMHewtMOwhIyUSO_2AZxbeEwRihjF2Ql_eYQ6bq2o&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
