	<summary>DIGITS not refresh screen again</summary>
	<description>
Problem:
I had reinstalled all my system right now.
There is a problem that DIGITS not refresh screen again.
Similer with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/415&gt;#415&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but not caused by  this time.
Resolution:
I set my requirements.txt as:

Pillow==2.3.0
numpy==1.8.2
scipy==0.13.3
protobuf==2.5.0
six==1.5.2
requests==2.2.1
gevent==1.0
Flask==0.10.1
Flask-WTF==0.11
wtforms==2.0.0
Flask-SocketIO==0.6.0
gunicorn==17.5
setuptools==3.3
lmdb==0.87
h5py==2.2.1
pydot2

and do for req in $(cat requirements.txt); do sudo pip install $req; done again
then DIGITS can refresh screen for me now.
I think this problem maybe caused by the library upgrading in the list,
but I don't caused by which library.

		You've posted the list of versions that work? That's not very helpful. Can you post the versions which cause the issue?
Also, which instructions are you following that are still using the shell  loop?

		I had try to upgrade all of the list to the last version one by one.
This problem maybe caused by gevent1.1.
There is a new uploaded on at 2016-03-12.
Please have a look of under URL.

		I think I also got the same problem and finally I figured out it's caused by gevent=1.1b4 with the following error:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After I downgrade gevent to 1.0, it works well.

		You're right, it looks like the latest version of  doesn't play nice with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio&gt;python-socketio&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PhoenixDai&gt;@PhoenixDai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'm seeing the exact same error with any  version greater than 1.0.2.

		Doing pip install 'gevent&lt;=1.0.2' fixed the issues for me. Shouldn't the requirements file be updated to enforce this?

 you're right. I thought that  was safe but I didn't realize I was actually using  from a pip installation instead of  that I installed with a deb package on 16.04. When I remove the pip installation I can see that  causes problems.

		I'd like to confirm the same issue on Windows.
Digits 4.0, OS Windows 7 x64, all steps from BuildDigitsWindows.md
Using gevent-1.1.2 results in "must be a native string" error and no autorefresh.
Installing gevent==1.0 solves the issue, but also requires a simple install of MS VC++ for Python2.7 (&lt;denchmark-link:http://aka.ms/vcpython27&gt;http://aka.ms/vcpython27&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
