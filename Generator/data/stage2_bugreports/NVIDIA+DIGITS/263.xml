For long directory paths, you can't see the base filename.

		Hi Luke, is this better with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gheinrich/DIGITS/commit/60dc98f53e6d0b174b7d413a779130f21815d1f9&gt;gheinrich@60dc98f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? This enables scrolling horizontally when the suggestion is longer than the text field.
Alternatively, I think it is possible to register a custom formatting function that could ensure that we show only the last x characters of suggestions.

		It's better, but still not great.
I think ideally the suggestions would only be the next piece of the path, like typing ls &lt;TAB&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;. For example, if you provide /home/ the suggestions would be guest/, lyeager/. And if you click on lyeager/, that would be appended to the current value to make /home/lyeager/. Is that possible?

		Good idea! I will try to implement this.

		I think this does what you suggested: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gheinrich/DIGITS/tree/dev/issue_263&gt;https://github.com/gheinrich/DIGITS/tree/dev/issue_263&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It doesn't append the trailing slash on directories though. This could possibly be implemented with some changes in the autocomplete route.
