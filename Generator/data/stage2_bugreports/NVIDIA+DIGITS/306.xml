	<summary>Address PicklingError for all OS's</summary>
	<description>
See #32 and this thread
People get  when trying to pickle protobuf objects. This happens on OSX, but also on Ubuntu 15.04 and even 14.04 in some cases. We should take the fix from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/commit/9824be9a7e56d1f375e5deac394527f56e73e99f&gt;9824be9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and use it for all platforms.
