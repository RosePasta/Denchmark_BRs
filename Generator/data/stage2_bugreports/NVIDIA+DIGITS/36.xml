	<summary>Incorrect image sizes</summary>
	<description>
Due to problem which was found in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/issues/29&gt;#29&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

the size of images, when "New Image Classification Dataset" are created, are not corresponds to "Mona Lisa" example (width and height are reversed).

Maybe is better to show some hint for sizes?
