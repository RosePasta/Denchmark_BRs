	<summary>Torch doesn't do initial validation phase</summary>
	<description>
Torch takes forever to actually output something on the loss/accuracy graph, and when something finally appears, it doesn't start at x=0. The way to fix this is to run a validation pass before beginning training.
Caffe by default does a pass through the validation data once before beginning to train the model (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/blob/v0.11.0/src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto#L134-L136&gt;see comments here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). They do this partly to ensure memory availability (which shouldn't be an issue with Torch), but it also helps DIGITS to be able to display something quickly.

: fixed the issue. Please test it once and close issue if fix looks good. Thanks for your time.

		That'll work. It doesn't have the initial training loss value, but that doesn't seem necessary.
Thanks!
