	<summary>Bad links to models in "Models" page</summary>
	<description>
In Models page (accessed through "View details") when clicked on model name the resulting page is not found. The URL is localhost/jobID and I guess it should be localhost/models/jobID as then it works as expected.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/p4jos&gt;@p4jos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! This one probably slipped through the net when &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/507&gt;#507&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was merged.
I have pushed PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/568&gt;#568&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for this.
