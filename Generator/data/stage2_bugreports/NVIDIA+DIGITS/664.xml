	<summary>[bug] Training stopped after "Classify one"</summary>
	<description>
I tried to perform a "Classify One" during training of an Alexnet (on Caffe). The new page (which should show the result) remains empty, even after several minutes. The training is now stuck.
I don't usually have this issue, this is the first time it has happened to me. I had to kill the server and restart it.

		I have had the same thing very often, very annoying. But for me it was solved when i built from source, with the latest versions apparently already fixing this issue. What version are you running?

		I was using the source version, dowloaded on the 21st of march. I now updated to the latest version, let's see if it happen again (I hope not!)

		I've also noticed this on version '3.0' . Haven't had it happen with the current source of '3.3'.

		I believe this was fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/573&gt;#573&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Feel free to re-open the issue if you see this again after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/573&gt;#573&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
