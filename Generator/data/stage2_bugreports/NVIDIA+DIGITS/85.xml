	<summary>Testing images with transparencies</summary>
	<description>
If you try to test an image with a transparency (like &lt;denchmark-link:http://images.vectorhq.com/images/previews/436/number-5-handwritten-98876.png&gt;this one&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), the background that gets inserted for the transparency is black instead of white. That's not what I would expect.
Fixing this will require digging into the PIL.Image documentation to figure out how to convert from RGBA to RGB (or LA to L) differently.
