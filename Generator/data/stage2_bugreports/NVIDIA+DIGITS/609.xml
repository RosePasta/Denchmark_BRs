Issue reported on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/603#issue-136531137&gt;#603 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

Output ordering - the wrong network output is displayed (e.g. for GoogLeNet)

and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/pull/603#issuecomment-189362864&gt;#603 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

even before inference jobs were introduced Googlenet was working out of "luck"... on 5efec65 (just before #573) if you change the name of loss1/classifier into z1 (any string greater than "prob" should do) then you get wrong results like:

		We can't rely on the order of outputs in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/pycaffe.py#L62&gt;_Net_forward&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 because a standard dictionary is used to return results. Similarly,  sorts results by name, not by creation order. In my understanding, this comes from these &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/net.cpp#L271-L277&gt;lines&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and the fact that a  is used, which sorts items by name.
The only fields which seem to be sorted in prototxt order and accessible using the Python bindings are _blobs, _blob_names, _layer_names.
