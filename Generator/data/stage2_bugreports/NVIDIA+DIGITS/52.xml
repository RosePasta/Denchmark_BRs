	<summary>caffe BGR issue</summary>
	<description>
hey,
After I trained the model successfully, I tried to test one image, and I found it does not do channel swap. So I am a little confused.
Here is my understanding:
Inside caffe, if you let caffe do decoding on the image, it will always be BGR format(by opencv). And I did not see any code inside digits, which will convert loaded images into BGR mode. Therefore,
digits create db -----&gt; with encoded images
caffe train the db ------&gt; with BGR format
digits test one image -------&gt; with RGB format
So the final result won't work as expected.
Did I miss anything?

		Rats. I intentionally avoided swapping channels because it's annoying and because I want the datasets to be consumable by different deep-learning frameworks which don't require the channel swap. It was all working fine until I added the JPEG compression.
I think the right thing to do is to do the channel swap at inference time only if the dataset was encoded and chalk this up to a caffe "bug".
Thanks very much for bringing this to my attention, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dxj19831029&gt;@dxj19831029&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
