	<summary>Inference error testing a single image</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to test a single image on a Torch network of with 3 layers (200K/200/200K, fully connected, and ReLu activations - similar to the autoencoder example).
Training works perfectly, but when try testing the network with a single image I receive this error:
InferenceError
'torch classify one task failed with error code 1'

		Hello Marco,
are you using DIGITS 3.0? Are you getting this error when using one of the
standard models as well or is this just related to this particular model?
You might get more information out of the DIGITS server log
(/var/log/digits). Otherwise can you post your network description so I can
try myself?
Thanks!

		Hi Greg,
It's 3.0, and it's a custom network, based on the auto encoder example, with just three layers but with bigger i/o (256x256x3).
I also tried commenting out {{blob}} visualization in infer_once.html but it didn't help (same error).

		It's fixed on master, but now I can no longer run inference while training.
I'll close this and open a new ticket.
