	<summary>reader.py misses the the &amp;lt;EX_ENAMEX&amp;gt; annotated entities on LeMonde Corpus</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I recently found that the reader.py script does not parse the entities annotated on the French corpus LeMonde annotated as  &lt;EX_ENAMEX&gt;, meaning that it misses some entities and also that it cuts some sentences as it ignores the text inside the tags.
This should not have a big impact as the number of entities annotated like this is rather little, but still it would be nice to patch the little bug. ðŸ˜„
Thanks!
