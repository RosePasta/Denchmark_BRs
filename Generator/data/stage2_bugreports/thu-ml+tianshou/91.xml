	<summary>Exception-raising in PrioritizedReplayBuffer</summary>
	<description>

 I have marked all applicable categories:

 exception-raising bug
 RL algorithm bug
 documentation request (i.e. "X is missing from the documentation.")
 new feature request


 I have visited the [source website], and in particular read the [known issues]
 I have searched through the [issue tracker] and [issue categories] for duplicates
 I have mentioned version numbers, operating system and environment, where applicable:
import tianshou, torch, sys
print(tianshou.__version__, torch.__version__, sys.version, sys.platform)


Version: tianshou=0.2.3, torch=1.5.1.
raise ValueError("batch_size should be less than len(self)")
When ''collect_per_step'' is less than ''batch_size'' in ''offpolicy_trainer'', the exception is always raised at the begin of the trianing process.

		PrioritizedReplayBuffer sampling without repeat by default, so the exception will be raised when the number of transitions in the buffer is less than the batch size. Please make sure there are enough transitions in the buffer.

		However, in the first epoch of the trianing process, collector collects ''collect_per_step'' data and then trainer ''batch_size'' samples from buffer. So the only solution without changing source code is that make sure ''collect_per_step'' larger than or equal to ''batch_size''. Right? Are there any other solutions?

 Sorry, I will try to fix it, and add the feature of sampling repeatedly as soon as possible tomorrow.
