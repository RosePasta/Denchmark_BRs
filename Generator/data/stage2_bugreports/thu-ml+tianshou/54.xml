I trained 400 epochs and the final result did not exceed 6 points. What parameters need to be adjusted?

		Could you please provide your configuration? (e.g. network architecture, hyperparam, ...)

		It was run on the original code, but increased to 400 epochs.

		It's our fault that we have no time to provide the tuned code example in the  folder currently.
A better solution is to change the example code's hyperparameter and network arch to the DQN paper's setting.

Nope. It hasnâ€™t been finished yet.

		Here it is: we now provide a DQN script which can solve Pong in 1M environment step (about 2000 seconds wall time in my computer). &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/pull/187&gt;#187&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The main issue of the previous version is that it doesn't use the wrapper provided by Deepmind. This is quite crucial.
Many thanks to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/davide97l&gt;@davide97l&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
