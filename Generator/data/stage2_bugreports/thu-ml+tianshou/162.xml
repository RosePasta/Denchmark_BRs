Hi, first thanks for the excellent work!
One thing I found may has potential bug.
When I was using a2c policy, I found that you calculate &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/blob/dev/tianshou/policy/modelfree/a2c.py#L111&gt;a_loss&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in this way, which may not work if the action has multiple dimension, say if the shape of output of dist.log_prob(a) is [bsz, n] while the shape of (r-v) is [bsz, 1] or [bsz] and neither of them can do dot product with the dis.log_prob(a). In my opinion, it would be better to use dist.log_prob(a).transpose(0,1) so that it will do multiplication among the same dimension.
