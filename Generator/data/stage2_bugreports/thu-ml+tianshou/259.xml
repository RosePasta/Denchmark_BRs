	<summary>question about atari_dqn with SubprocVectorEnv</summary>
	<description>
When running atari_dqn with SubprocVectorEnv, I found the memory occupied by each EnvWorker increases gradually when training, e.g. from 115MB to 500MB,  what causes this?

		Could you please provide the task name so that I can have a look?

		the task name is PongNoFrameskip-v4

		I ran 15 epochs and didn't see any memory increase in each worker. They all kept with 132M. I use the command python3 examples/atari/atari_dqn.py --task "PongNoFrameskip-v4" --batch-size 64.
Possible explanations:

the wrapper takes up some memory
the SubprocVectorEnv takes up some memory

But both of them seem impossible to triple their own memory consumption.

		Can you tell me how much memory atari_dqn.py needs? And how do you monitor the memory of each worker? Thank you very much and I run it in windows system.

		I use Linux. The total memory should not be greater than 5GB (about 3~4G). I use htop to monitor memory usage.

		I try again, the total memory of running atari_dqn.py is at least 8GB, it puzzles me. Maybe something wrong happens in windows？

		Hmm...I'm not sure. Could you please do the followings (one by one, not together) to see what happens?

set --training-num 1
set --test-num 1
change SubprocVectorEnv to DummyVectorEnv

		when I set --training-num 1，the total memory is 4GB.

		I find the reason: NumPy 1.16.0 can cause severe memory leak with SubprocVectorEnv. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12793&gt;numpy/numpy#12793&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for details. Maybe you can add a tip about this.

		Thank you very much, this problem is too difficult to find out.

		Interesting. Thanks for your report.
