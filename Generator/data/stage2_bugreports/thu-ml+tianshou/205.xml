	<summary>small bug in example</summary>
	<description>

 I have marked all applicable categories:

 exception-raising bug
 RL algorithm bug
 documentation request (i.e. "X is missing from the documentation.")
 new feature request


 I have visited the source website
 I have searched through the issue tracker for duplicates
 I have mentioned version numbers, operating system and environment, where applicable:
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import tianshou, torch, sys
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(tianshou.__version__, torch.__version__, sys.version, sys.platform)
 0.2.6 1.6.0 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 07:30:14) 
 [GCC 7.3.0] linux


The atari_dqn .py in '/example' is something wrong. The ReplayBuffer is initialled by buffer = ReplayBuffer(args.buffer_size, ignore_obs_next=True, save_last_obs=True, stack_num=args.frames_stack). But in the define is:
class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, size: int, stack_num: int = 1,
                 ignore_obs_next: bool = False,
                 save_only_last_obs: bool = False,
                 sample_avail: bool = False) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__()
Thanks

Mybad. Thanks!

And Maybe the module in PyPi should be updated. I first use pip install tianshou to install it. Some APIs are different from the GitHub version. The examples can't run.

		Yes, I know. However, you can checkout the corresponding version's examples for running.

It is because that in v0.2.6, the tuned atari examples are not added into the codebase.

Thanks, I got it. I don't know about it just now,  I debugged it locally. 2333
