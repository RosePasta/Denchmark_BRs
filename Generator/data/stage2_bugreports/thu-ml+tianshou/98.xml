	<summary>ActorProb has redundant activation function in SAC examples</summary>
	<description>

 I have marked all applicable categories:

 exception-raising bug
 RL algorithm bug
 documentation request (i.e. "X is missing from the documentation.")
 new feature request


 I have visited the source website, and in particular read the known issues
 I have searched through the issue tracker and issue categories for duplicates
 I have mentioned version numbers, operating system and environment, where applicable:
import tianshou, torch, sys
print(tianshou.__version__, torch.__version__, sys.version, sys.platform)


In examples/continuous_net.py, the ActorProb adds a tanh to mu while this is needed for other actor-critic algorithm but redundant for sac. The reason is that sac uses a reparameterization trick in implementation which bases on an unbounded gaussian distribution in original paper.
