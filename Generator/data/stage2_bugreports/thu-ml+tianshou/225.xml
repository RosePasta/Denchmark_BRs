YarsRevenge atari env uses 30GB of RAM (with 1M replay buffer), as other envs usually use 8~10GB ram with the same setting. Also, BattleZone uses 20GB and NameThisGame uses 48GB.

		These games may encounter an infinite-loop and reach the max episode step (typically 100000 or 400000). Since our collector needs to collect a full-length episode at each time currently, this issue cannot be avoided and the temporal solution is to add another gym.wrappers.TimeLimit.
