 directly. Need I install tf and tensorboard additionally for I didn't found these requirements in readme.

		Tianshou has already added the tensorboard in the requirement, in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/blob/master/setup.py#L53&gt;https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou/blob/master/setup.py#L53&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Maybe something went wrong through the installation? Or have you already installed the tensorboard before installing tianshou? Upgrade them first.

		No. I create a new env with conda, and pip install this repo.
conda create -n pytorch python==3.6.5
pip install git+&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou.git@master&gt;https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou.git@master&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hmm...That's a problem. This morning I helped another person for installing tianshou on Anaconda. The following command works fine:
# create a new virtualenv and install pip, change the env name if you like
conda create -n myenv pip 
# activate the environment
conda activate myenv
# install tianshou
pip install tianshou
In short, please make sure the pip is installed in your created venv.

		There is still the same problem...

		Have you tried upgrading your conda, e.g., conda update conda?
		</comment>
		<comment id='8' author='initial-h' date='2020-04-27T13:07:49Z'>
		Make no difference. It's the latest version already I think.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;conda upgrade --all
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done
# All requested packages already installed.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

No. I create a new env with conda, and pip install this repo.
conda create -n pytorch python==3.6.5
pip install git+https://github.com/thu-ml/tianshou.git@master
There may be something wrong among conda and pip

I test it but the second command pip is not in your "pytorch" venv. It will install some package outside your env.

		<comment id='10' author='initial-h' date='2020-04-27T13:10:22Z'>
		conda will install pip, like you mentioned before.
conda create ...
source activate ...
pip install ...

		<comment id='11' author='initial-h' date='2020-04-27T13:12:25Z'>
		So what's the output of "which pip" or "pip -V"?
		</comment>
		<comment id='12' author='initial-h' date='2020-04-27T13:14:00Z'>
		you mean pip version? it's 20.0.2
pip 20.0.2 from /anaconda3/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip (python 3.6)

		<comment id='13' author='initial-h' date='2020-04-27T13:18:58Z'>
		Hmm...that's quite strange. BTW, I think "tensorflow" has no attribute "io" can be resolved by installing tensorflow manually. Though in the unittest it doesn't need to install tensorflow and still runs well.
In [11]: import tensorflow as tf

In [12]: tf.io
Out[12]: &lt;module 'tensorflow._api.v1.io' from '/home/trinkle/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/_api/v1/io/__init__.py'&gt;

		You can also manually comment the lines of SummaryWriter in the test script :)

		<comment id='15' author='initial-h' date='2020-04-27T13:24:42Z'>
		yeah, I pip install tensorflow manually and this problem has been solved. Thanks!
