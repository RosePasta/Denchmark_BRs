 I have marked all applicable categories:

 exception-raising bug
 RL algorithm bug
 documentation request (i.e. "X is missing from the documentation.")

 I have visited the source website, and in particular read the known issues
 I have searched through the issue tracker and issue categories for duplicates
 I have mentioned version numbers, operating system and environment, where applicable

Batch instances are creating infinite recursive loop when used in argument of a multiprocessing Pipe. Here is a snippet to reproduce the issue.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tianshou.data import Batch
from multiprocessing import Pipe
(p, c) = Pipe()
c.send(Batch(a=1.0))
print(p.recv())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Similarly, using Pickle without multiprocessing produces the same issue.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tianshou.data import Batch
import pickle
pickle.dump(Batch(a=1.0), open("save.p", "wb"))                                                                                                                                                     
pickle.load(open("save.p", "rb"))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm going to open a PR that fixes the issue.
