	<summary>Project configuration - multiple save buttons can lose data</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When configuring a project - each section has a save button. However its common to configure multiple options in multiple sections in 'one go'
Hitting save after doing so may cause one to loose configurations in other sections.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Go to 'Project, configure'
Click on 'Collaborators'
Configure options in Instruction, Interface and Completions.
Click one of the save buttons.
Only one of the options configured is saved.

Expected behavior
All options are saved.

		It seems it's not a bug. Each section has own "Save" button. To save anything in section you need to tap corresponding to this section "Save". But yes, it's not very comfortable, in future we'll make an instant saving of options without "Save" buttons.

		I agree it’s not a bug - but it’s a design issue that makes it easy to configure things and then lose the configuration unexpectedly. Thanks for consideration!
