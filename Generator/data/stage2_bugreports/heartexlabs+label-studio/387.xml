		Which script are you using? You will need to add dependencies to the  file and then only bring the containers up. For example if you want to use the simple_text_classifier.py script, then add  in the requirements.txt file, and then  should work. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dslim23&gt;@dslim23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
