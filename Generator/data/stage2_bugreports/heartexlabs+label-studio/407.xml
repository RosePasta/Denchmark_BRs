	<summary>Inconsistent RectangleLabels Export</summary>
	<description>
**Edit: Just my stupidity, no bug... After studying label-studio-converter/label_studio_converter/converter.py in detail, I realized that the mentioned values are not absolute but percentage values w.r.t. the original size.
Straight-forward calculations like x = x * original_width /100.0, etc., did the trick.
My suggestion would be to document this behavior somewhere :-)**
Hi,
When I label bounding boxes, the exported JSON will look like this:
{
"from_name": "tag",
"id": "JEzqD6xkmq",
"image_rotation": 0,
"original_height": 154,
"original_width": 66,
"parent_id": null,
"source": "$image",
"to_name": "image",
"type": "rectanglelabels",
"value": {
"height": 14.285714285714286,
"rectanglelabels": [
"box_name"
],
"rotation": 0,
"width": 28.78787878787879,
"x": 40.90909090909091,
"y": 7.142857142857143
}
}
My intuitive guess was that x and y refer to the top-left corner of the bounding box and that (x+width, y+height) will yield to bottom-right corner of the bounding box. However, this is not the case.
Instead, x and y appear to randomly point to either of the following corner: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.
Furthermore, width and height can be either horizontally or vertically.
Is the mistake on my side, am I missing something, or is this behavior unintended?
Info: The problem occurs with a fresh version of label Studio installed via pip. The corresponding config snippet is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;RectangleLabels name="tag" toName="image"&gt;
    &lt;Label value="box_name" background="red"&gt;&lt;/Label&gt;
&lt;/RectangleLabels&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
