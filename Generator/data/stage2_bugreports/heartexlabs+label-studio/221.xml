Describe the bug
TIFF image can have .tif file extension which is not seen by the server. And it fails with an error.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;user:/project/labelling# label-studio init labeling_project --input-path=/input/img --input-format=image-dir
Empty config has been created in ./labeling_project/config.xml
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/conda/bin/label-studio", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    sys.exit(main())
  File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/label_studio/server.py", line 635, in main
    Project.create_project_dir(input_args.project_name, input_args)
  File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/label_studio/project.py", line 499, in create_project_dir
    tasks = cls._load_tasks(input_path, args, config_xml_path)
  File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/label_studio/project.py", line 440, in _load_tasks

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vfdev-5&gt;@vfdev-5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
Thanks for reporting this. Yes format is what we've missed, only .
But actually the problem is that we have to specify a label config explicitly when  - otherwise we don't know the name of the input tag for . Another option could be preparing all your task in &lt;denchmark-link:https://labelstud.io/guide/format.html#JSON-file&gt;json format&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, then you don't need for label config because JSON formatted tasks already contain the input tag key.
Anyway, here the PR that prevent starting Label Studio in these circumstances and I hope it makes things simpler &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/pull/223&gt;#223&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
