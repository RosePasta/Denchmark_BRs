	<summary>Could not find "default_configs" error when create ML backend</summary>
	<description>
Hi I got this issue when trying to create an example ML back-end
OSError: Could not find "default_configs" at package "/Users/lt/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/label_studio"
I followed the tutorial to create ML backend:
label-studio-ml init my_ml_backend --script label-studio/ml/examples/simple_text_classifier.py
Do you have any idea?

		Hi Niklub,
Thank you for your response! had anaconda (3, python 3.7 on MAC OS) in my machine before I started install label-studio.
I used:
pip install label-studio
To install label-studio.

		It seems that when I install from source code it works. There should be issue with pip instalation when anaconda is present
