		I think it relates with the signature parameter on the generated url.  The structure is:
https://BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/file/filename?AWSAccessKeyId=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&amp;Signature=SIGNATURE&amp;Expires=EXPIRATION
When I remove it, it works (now I'm testing using my bucket public, so maybe it's not required?). Could it be that the signature generation has something wrong?
Here are the signature and url generation docs: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html&gt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Had the same issue. Turns out it is indeed the default boto signature generation that doesn't work on all regions (new regions, introduced after 2014).
Way to reproduce: use a bucket in e.g. eu-central. Images do not load as a result.
I submitted a merge request with the change that fixed it for me: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/pull/402&gt;#402&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Additionally, you may have to create a  file to set the region the bucket is in.
Example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[default]
region=eu-central-1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thank you for the fix, I was having the same issues.
I checkout out release/0.7.5 and it kept failing for me.
Only after setting .aws/config file it finally started showing images.
My config file looks as follows
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;maxim@maxim-ThinkPad-E480:~$ cat ~/.aws/config 
[default]
region=us-east-2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I wonder if label-studio should recommend setting this as best practice, I'd be a bit cautious here as it's a system-wide setting that might break other stuff for the user.
Maybe a better option would be to automatically retrieve the location and then apply the region for a newly established AWS connection?

 May you create a PR with auto region selection?
