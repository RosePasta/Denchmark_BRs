	<summary>Overlapping annotations incorrect and not displayed</summary>
	<description>
When adding an (entity) annotation to text that overlaps an existing one, e.g. starts before and ends after an existing one, an annotation is added that has wrong offsets (start=null, end=0) but no annotation is shown visually.
Correctly dealing with overlapping annotations is important for some tasks.
However if a task explicitly disallowes it, no annotations should get created and an error should get shown.
