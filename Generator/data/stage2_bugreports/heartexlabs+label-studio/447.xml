Describe the bug
Hi all,

I created a new conda environment (conda create -n labelstudio),
activated the environment (conda activate labelstudio),
installed label-studio (pip install labelstudio)
try to init a project (label-studio init labeling_project),
and received the following error.

I thought maybe this was because I omitted specifying the python version when creating the conda env, so I did

conda install python=3.8,
re-ran label-studio init labeling_project and got the same error.

FIX: this was solved by pip install -U six
To Reproduce
Above
Expected behavior
No error on label-studio init labeling_project

 It's known issue, we fixed it in release/0.7.5.
Or you can use 0.7.4.post1:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install label-studio==0.7.4.post1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
