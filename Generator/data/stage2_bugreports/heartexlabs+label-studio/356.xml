	<summary>redirect to /welcome behind a reverse proxy doesn't work</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
We use labelstudio behind traefik and rewrite the path. So users go to /prefix/* When there are no tasks, the home page redirects to /welcome not /prefix/welcome
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

setup like #273
have no tasks
go to the base url

Expected behavior
should redirect to /prefix/welcome
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: aws-linux (eks 1.14)
Browser: all

Should be an easy fix.
just need to add a configuration for the redirect



label-studio/label_studio/server.py


         Line 169
      in
      0c68617






 return redirect('/welcome')
