		Yes, it's not obviously, but there is a such way to label NERs on iOS:


Select category (this step is the first on all devices always)


Select text


After you see iOS menu with "Copy" "Find" "Share" (etc) - double click on the outside rest of the text (not fast double click!)


(optionally) if you select some text region and want to escape of the selection - press "unselect" button on Result panel.

		It worked! As you said, wasn't intuitive at the beginning, but it grew on me. I wonder if it can be a more snappy experience. I am integrating the front-end and I am learning the ropes, will let you know as soon as I would be able to provide a PR with an enhancement. We can probably close this issue otherwise.
