	<summary>JSONDecode Error on Empty file</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
If there is an empty completion file where there is no labelling and you happen to restart the docker container, the project is not loaded even on using --force flag as it throws JSONDecodeError Error on an empty file.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Submit an empty file without labelling
Restart the docker container
The project fails to load due to JSONDecodeError on the empty file

Expected behavior
It should skip the empty file without trying to read it in JSON and load the existing project.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Ubuntu

I am happy to fix this bug and create a pull request.

		Apologies for the late response. I upgraded to the latest version 0.7.0 and this problem seems to have been resolved. Thanks for that! I fixed it in the previous version for my project but it's not required now :) I am closing the issue.
