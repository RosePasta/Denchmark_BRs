	<summary>Polygon and Rectangle examples returning errors</summary>
	<description>

When using  or   examples from &lt;denchmark-link:https://labelstud.io/tags/rectangle.html&gt;https://labelstud.io/tags/rectangle.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://labelstud.io/tags/polygon.html&gt;https://labelstud.io/tags/polygon.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 respectively inside the config.xml using the autogenerated sample data it crashes on the frontend (spinner of death) and in the browser console there was an error 
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Copy example Tag code from docs
Add into config.xml
Autogenerate a task
Add 1 or more polygons and submit (if using Rectangle just clicking the image breaks the UI and console logs error: TypeError: "e is null"

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Backend running in Docker, host machine: MacOS 10.15.4
Browser: Firefox 75.0

Additional context
I can use PolygonLabels and RectangleLabels as a workaround but would be nicer to use Rectangle and Polygon as I have only one type of object to detect

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ghandic&gt;@ghandic&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! We've just fixed this tags so they work again. The only obvious limitation for now â€” they can't be used simultaneously because we don't have any toggle to switch between drawing tools (as it works for RectangleLabels and others, because labels itself are such a toggles).
Playground is still broken, but we'll update labelstud.io soon. You can already use this tags in your project with new 0.7.1 version. Thanks for reporting!
