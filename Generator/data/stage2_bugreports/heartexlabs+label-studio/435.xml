	<summary>DOM vs page loads time (appears on screen)</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Currently, the DOM loads fast, but the browser page renders very slowly. It is taking up to 22 seconds or sometimes even more
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
I've attached the config and JSON file to reproduce the issue

Create a New Project
Save the config which I've attached
Go to the import page and import the JSON file which I've attached
Now try to load the labeling page and it will take a lot of time to appear the work on the screen

Expected behavior
I think, the page loads as quickly as the DOM

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

 In  version, work is impressive.
but I just want to ask you a few questions:

My above issue totally depends on the front-end repository?
If yes, then which branch depicts this LS 0.7.5 in front-end repo for the latest changes. I mean from where I can find the latest front-end code. It is tmp/deserialize branch?
If so then when you guys are going to make an official release for the new changes
