	<summary>JSON dir storage not working correctly</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I am using the latest stable version of label-studio(0.8.1) and I am experimenting with dir-jsons as tasks storage and found out that it's not well supported or properly documented.
If I follow the documentation at &lt;denchmark-link:https://labelstud.io/guide/tasks.html#Directory-with-JSON-files&gt;https://labelstud.io/guide/tasks.html#Directory-with-JSON-files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I get the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ mkdir tmp &amp;&amp; label-studio init --input-path=$PWD/tmp --input-format=json-dir test
$ grep source -A 3 test/config.json
  "source": {
    "name": "Tasks",
    "type": "tasks-json", #  &lt;----
    "path": "&lt;REDACTED&gt;/test/tasks.json"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But I am expecting the output to be:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  "source": {
    "name": "Tasks",
    "type": "dir-jsons", # &lt;-----
    "path": "&lt;REDACTED&gt;/test/tasks.json"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Anyway after manually fixing the config.json file I see that there is an error in the Tasks view:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Project loading error
object of type 'generator' has no len()
Traceback

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/label_studio/utils/misc.py", line 91, in exception_f
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File ".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/label_studio/blueprint.py", line 317, in tasks_page

    'task_count': len(self.source_storage.ids()),

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nopper&gt;@nopper&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
The "source" key in config.json points to the storage from where your tasks are taken during the runtime (for the local file system it is tasks.json by default. This storage could be different from where you import your data (directory $PWD/tmp with JSON files in your particular case). So "type": "tasks-json" is expected, and is not intended to be modified (that's why you probably get an error).
I've tried to import data from directory with JSON files (structured as {"text": "one two three"} in each tmp/file.json) with the following command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;label-studio start my_project --input-path tmp/ --input-format json-dir --label-config label_studio/examples/text_classification/config.xml --init
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and it works fine. Please reopen this issue if you'll encounter any runtime problems with your import.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/niklub&gt;@niklub&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for the fast turn around. I am a little bit confused then.
Maybe it's easier if I explain to you my use case: I have another program that, e.g let say daily, creates a series of tasks to for label-studio, as json files in a specific directory.
How can I get label-studio to detect these new tasks and load them from that directory? Before that I was merging all the tasks in a single json file but it's less convenient and error prone.
