	<summary>label-studio: command not found during installation in Ubuntu session of EC2</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I was installing Label Studio on my AWS EC2 instance. In the Ubuntu session, I could successfully install label-studio using the 'pip install label-studio' command.
However, when I was performing the "init" and "start" commands. I am getting an error that says 'label-studio: command not found'.
Python version - 3.6 and Ubuntu 18.4
What could be the possible reason? Also, is this the correct method to deploy on EC2 instance.

		Try this one:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python3 -m pip install label-studio
python3 -m label-studio init my_project
python3 -m label-studio start my_project
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Do you use virtualenv?

 Thanks for the suggestions.
However, a simple re-SSH into the instance did the work. But anyway, thanks. Closing now.
