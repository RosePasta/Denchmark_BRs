	<summary>Labels skewed when viewing after submission</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I first go through and label an image using brush the labels appear as they should. Then, after I submit if I go back to 'Tasks' and view the image the labels are skewed. I think the labels are still correct, just displayed funny.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5555526/80949624-03e80100-8dfd-11ea-9ff0-cb7f65345812.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here's the config -
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;View&gt;
  &lt;BrushLabels name="tag" toName="img"&gt;
    &lt;Label value="Alive" background="green" /&gt;
    &lt;Label value="Dead" background="red" /&gt;
  &lt;/BrushLabels&gt;
  &lt;Image name="img" value="$image" zoom="true" zoomControl="true" /&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Go to tasks
Label the image
Submit
Go back to Tasks
View the submitted task
Labels are skewed.

Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Viewing from the Tasks screen

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Running with docker (latest image)
Browser Chrome
Version [e.g. 22]

Additional context
Not sure if it's helpful or not, but I get this error from the console.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Konva warning: The stage has 6 layers. Recommended maximum number of layers is 3-5. Adding more layers into the stage may drop the performance. Rethink your tree structure, you can use Konva.Group.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 We've released a new LS version 0.7.0. Can you check is this bug persistent in the new version? I can't reproduce it in this version.

		Hello,
I'm in version 0.7.3 and I'm still seeing inconsistencies with the segmentation with brushes. The segmentation gets displaced and scaled when I save it (or update it) and query it again.
Thanks!

		Great thanks. Is it only a visualization problem, or the labels are not correctly saved? This is to understand if I can still use the tool to label regions.

 We've just released label-studio 0.7.4rc2 with a lot of fixes regarding to brushes. The issue with skew and resizes must be fixed there. If it's still actual, please check it.
Also we've added brush converters on export page to save the results as numpy 2d arrays and PNG.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip uninstall label-studio
pip install label-studio==0.7.4rc2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
