	<summary>Large images don't render in Chrome</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Large images (in this case 20000 x 20000) don't render in Chrome, but they do in Edge.
I don't know if it's an issue on the browser side or on LS side, but maybe this behavior should be documented somewhere as I spent quit a bit of time thinking that something was wrong with my configuration.
To Reproduce
Import large images
Expected behavior
Images should render on both browsers

		Can you send us any huge image which has this behavior?
But it seems the problem is in browser.

		You're right &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/makseq&gt;@makseq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It was an image format problem, not related to the size : Chrome doesn't support TIFF. &lt;denchmark-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Image_format_support&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Image_format_support&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for you help ! I'm closing this issue.
