	<summary>Only one task detected while importing data from text file</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
If we import data from text file (I tried for classification by passing config and path to dataset text file from command line), it says only one task is imported. When I checked, it was taking whole file as single task.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Use a text file as the input dataset
Run label-studio start-multi-session --input-path=&lt;path to text file&gt; --input-format=text -l &lt;path to config file&gt;

Expected behavior
It should import each line in the file as separate task
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Mac
Version : 0.5


After debugging for some time and going through code, I found that issue is at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/blob/master/label_studio/tasks.py#L90&gt;function that reads from text file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . When we read from file,  is not incremented.
