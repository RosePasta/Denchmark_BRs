	<summary>Unexpected sequential sampling behaviour</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Tasks are NOT sampled according to the order of id (Tasks are ordered ascending by their "id" fields. This is default mode.)
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Import tasks JSON file.
Confirm the sampling mode is set to sequential.
Start labeling, and tasks are sampled randomly.

Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
Tasks are ordered ascending by their "id" fields. This is default mode.
Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: [e.g. iOS]
Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]
Version [e.g. 22]

Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.
Turns out the ids are not sorted:



label-studio/label_studio/project.py


        Lines 410 to 414
      in
      b23bba4






 task_iter = filter(lambda i: i not in completed_tasks_ids, self.source_storage.ids()) 



 if sampling == 'sequential': 



 task_id = next(task_iter, None) 



 if task_id is not None: 



 return self.source_storage.get(task_id) 








label-studio/label_studio/storage/filesystem.py


        Lines 24 to 25
      in
      b23bba4






 elif isinstance(tasks, dict): 



 self.data = tasks 








label-studio/label_studio/storage/filesystem.py


        Lines 53 to 54
      in
      b23bba4






 def ids(self): 



 return self.data.keys()

What LS version do you use?

I use the docker image heartexlabs/label-studio:latest and import the tasks.json formatted like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "data": ...
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "data": ...
  },
  ...
]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Please, check 0.7.5rc1, it is fixed there.
