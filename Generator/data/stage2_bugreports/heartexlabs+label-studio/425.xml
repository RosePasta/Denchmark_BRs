	<summary>Cannot remove model</summary>
	<description>
In the model page, the X button to disconnect the model does not work.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create a ML backend
Go to model page
Add a ML backend
Click the X button on the connected backend
Confirm that you want to delete the model
The model is still there

Expected behavior
The model should be removed.
Even better, the slider on the bottom of the model card could be used to disconnect the model without removing it altogether -- right now, it is unfunctional.

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

 can't reproduce that issue. Can you check whether there are some error logs in the server console while deleting the ML backend?

		No errors in the console. I noticed that it only happens in Firefox. In Chrome, there is no issue. (I am on MacOS if it helps)
