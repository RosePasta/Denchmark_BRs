	<summary>Tasks path / Completion path not fully shown if long</summary>
	<description>
This is probably trivial to solve, but I don't want to mess with the front-end code too much:
When using a long path (as is often the case with ADLS storage), the full path is not displayed any more.
Edit: In case it is not obvious (maybe not the best screenshot): The path does not end after "user", it goes on, but this is not shown any more.
