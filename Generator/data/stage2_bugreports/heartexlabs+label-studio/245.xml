&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have tried both CSV and Text files.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Go to import task
Click on upload data
Scroll down to '....'
Error: can't upload/process file on server side. Reasons: Critical error, see console for more description

Expected behavior
With Sample file without new addition it is working fine as expected.

 Can you please provide a minimal config and a sample of the CSV file that produces that error. Without that, it's hard to tell if the error is in the code or in the input. Thanks!

 This happened to me too, I was able to fix it; let me take a guess at what happened to you:
I tried to Import Tasks from a file containing Unicode characters that failed to transcode during the conversion from Input Data to Task, causing the process to abort while writing to tasks.json, causing an incomplete JSON document, producing an error similar to the one pasted in your OP whenever Label Studio (LS) tries to read its own tasks.json file before manipulating it during subsequent Import requests.
To see if I'm on the right track, and to take the first step to fixing it, follow:

In the project directory (containing the config.xml generated by you or LS), you should also see tasks.json Open this file and scroll to the bottom. Is it complete, valid JSON? Or does it look like an unfinished homework assignment?
If it's complete, then it's not your tasks file and this was a bad guess; your issue isn't my own.
If it's incomplete, note the id of the incomplete record, because that's the line in your CSV/Source document causing the initial problem. For example, this would point me to Line 213 in my CSV:

Fix the error in the CSV, and either delete tasks.json and start over, or remove the incomplete record and close up the JSON document to make it valid again.
