	<summary>Copy text not possible for document classification task</summary>
	<description>
Create text classification project that shows text to the annotator. The text also includes URLs or terms that the annotator may want to look up.
However normal copying the string to look up is not possible, presumably because the code that normally handles text selection in order create a sequence annotation (like for NER) is active.
"Normal copying" would be that the  user marks the text to copy with the mouse, releases the mouse button (the marked text span stays highligthed) then presses Ctrl-C or right-clicks and chooses "Copy". This is not possible because the highlighted text immediately gets de-selected when the mouse button is released.
A workaround is to press Ctrl-C while the mouse button for selecting the text is still being held, but this is unintuitive and hard to discover.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Browser: Firefox 62.0.3
Version: label-studio 0.5.1
