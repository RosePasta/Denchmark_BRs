	<summary>Labelling tasks hang with untraceable error</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Hi, I am trying to make a Sentence Text Similarity (STS) task using Label Studio. The idea is that given two sentences, we rate a score between 1 to 5.
I was able to configure both config.xml and tasks.csv properly, but when it comes to the actual labelling, it's just stuck at the loading screen.
Can you please guide me on anything I might have missed?
To Reproduce
Minimal config.xml:
&lt;View&gt;
  &lt;Text name="sentences" value="$pair" /&gt;
  &lt;Rating name="rating" toName="sentences" maxRating="5" icon="star" size="medium" /&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
Minimal tasks.csv (I load this via the UI):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pair
The sky is dark tonight. It is a bit dark.
News reports say that the weather will be stormy. The dog is cute.
Label studio is awesome! Label studio is cool!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Logs. There's a 501 error in the POST request, and I'm not sure why it's happening

Expected behavior
I expect that whenever I click the Submit button, it registers as a completion. So far it's just stuck in the loading screen

This also shows up when I try the web app demo

 Thanks for the thorough bug report, I can reproduce and the error seems to be with the Rating component. Looks like it was not updated with the latest release. We're planning to fix that with the 0.6.0 in the next couple of weeks. For now, you can simulate the same functionality using the Chocies tag. Feel free to ping me in Slack meanwhile if you need additional help with that.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deppp&gt;@deppp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks a lot for this! Ok, for now, I'll use the Choices tag instead.
I appreciate the prompt response. Let me know if I should close this Issue or if you'll still use this as a reference for the bugfix.
