	<summary>Docker-compose up not working on Mac OS</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Readme.md states to run the following command to start the application via docker-compose, but when I do this the webapp is not running or not reachable.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Clone the project on Mac OS
Execute the README.md's requested INIT_COMMAND='--init' docker-compose up -d
Wait for command to finish
Web app should be reachable from localhost:8080, but nothing is there

Expected behavior
The web app should come up, or we need to clean up the documentation if docker-compose no longer works
Screenshots
n/a
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Mac OS Catalina
Browser Chrome
Version -  master branch as of todays date

Additional context
last lines of output from docker-compose are as follows

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I even tried again with another command cited in the readme.. no avail.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(base) emcp@EMCPs-Mac-mini label-studio % docker-compose up -d
WARNING: The INIT_COMMAND variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/my_project:/label-studio/my_project --name label-studio heartexlabs/label-studio:latest label-studio start my_project --init --host 0.0.0.0
