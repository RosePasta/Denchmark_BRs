	<summary>CSV Export does not have any mapping with Label studio portal.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
CSV generated through label studio export feature does not contain any task-id, any other mapping to link annotations on the portal. It only has an Image column which is a URL to the image, but one filter task by image URL on the portal. It would require task-id.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Export the annotations as CSV.
Check for columns in the CSV.

Expected behavior
there should be a Task-ID column, task URL in the CSV.
