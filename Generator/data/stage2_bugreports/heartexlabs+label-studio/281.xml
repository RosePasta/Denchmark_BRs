	<summary>Error occurred while export results with more than one completions</summary>
	<description>
After finished my demo task with on multiple-choice and two completions, I tried to export the results. The JSON format export works but JSON_MIN, TSV, and CSV formats throw this error: Error occurred while export.
It seems that this occurs when one task has more than one completions because the other three formats only allow one annotation.
Currently, every time I explore the tasks after finishing, a new empty completion will be automatically created, and then only JSON format can work.
