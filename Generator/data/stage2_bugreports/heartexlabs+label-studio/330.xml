	<summary>Can't export completion as csv</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I try to export results as CSV, I got Chrome message "undefined". And it seems that real reason is an internal error in the server on "GET /api/export?format=CSV HTTP/1.1" 500 -

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu
Browser: Chrome 83
Label-studio 0.7.2

		Can you show your label config?

		Here is it:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;View&gt;
  &lt;Image name="img" value="$image"&gt;&lt;/Image&gt;
  &lt;Choices name="tag" toName="img" choice="single-radio"&gt;
    &lt;Choice value="Overview"&gt;&lt;/Choice&gt;
    &lt;Choice value="Close view"&gt;&lt;/Choice&gt;
    &lt;Choice value="Cuted"&gt;&lt;/Choice&gt;
    &lt;Choice value="Garbage"&gt;&lt;/Choice&gt;
  &lt;/Choices&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I checked this config, everything is ok. Can you send sample of imported tasks?
Probably the problem is in tasks (maybe any encoding problems?)

		I have faced similar issues due to multiple completions on a given task. When I deleted the extra completions on a task and just kept one, exporting CSV was successful. Can you confirm if you have multiple completions as well?

 How to verify this?

		I checked it in the logs and could see errors that said "Currently only one completion can be added per task - we can't convert more than one completions, but 2 completions found in item:" Here the whole task used to be present along with its ID. So you can go to that task and remove that completion.
I am not sure how you can look for multiple completions without checking the log.
I can also see in the converter that they do not support multiple completions for exporting to CSV. I have attached the screenshot of the label-studio-converter that is used for this purpose.

 I verified result.json and you are right there is repeating of one of the tasks. Thank you for the tip.

 At least it will be nice if UI will show some clear message about this.
And that is strange that I did nothing for repeating the same task. Is it possible to check repeats and remove them in UI?

 By parsing json in a more verbose way, found that there is one image with the missed result and one image with the 2 results. In the same time UI says that all tasks completed.

 thank you very much!

 Yes, I will add this in the nearest release. But you can use JSON instead of JSON_MIN, it must work with multiple completions.
