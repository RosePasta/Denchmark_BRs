	<summary>Wrong link opened in case of changing port</summary>
	<description>

In my situation port 8080 was bonded by another process and label-studio gracefully took port 8081 during the start command. And in the text description label-studio correctly shown &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8081&gt;http://localhost:8081&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but opened page was &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run any other server on 8080 port
Start label-studio
Check opened page
