	<summary>Issue import text data for ner</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I drag a .txt file on the import tasks box, I get the error:
(I can load the tasks by clicking the import box and going through the uploader screens.)
"Error: can't upload/process file on server side. Reasons:
Critical error, see console for more description"
The terminal says:
"raise ValidationError('load_tasks: No data found in DATA or in FILES')
label_studio.utils.exceptions.ValidationError: load_tasks: No data found in DATA or in FILES
[2020-04-13 23:31:02,175] [werkzeug] [INFO] 127.0.0.1 - - [13/Apr/2020 23:31:02] "POST /api/import HTTP/1.1" 500 -"
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Go to 'import' tab.
Drag and drop a text file
See error

Expected behavior
The file should load, and tasks should appear in the tasks.json file.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: iOS
Browser: Chrome and Brave
Python Version: Python 3.6.2
I ran pip install label-studio to get the latest version

Additional context
I can upload the document by clicking the upload box instead of dragging and dropping the file.

		Alright...I'm sorry I didn't respond. The issue was happening seemingly randomly, I put off checking why and just didn't get back to you.
