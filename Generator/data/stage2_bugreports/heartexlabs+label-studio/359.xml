	<summary>Task page errors - resources not found</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I am using 'base href' because the host changes in every deployment.
When navigating to 'Tasks' page I get alert box's warning that the following can not be found:

/api/project - Project loading error
/api/project/storage-settings - Error while get api for &lt;storage_settings_all&gt;
-/api/tasks - Tasks loading error

This  similar to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/issues/358&gt;#358&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, where the solution is to remove the leading "/"

		Sorry, I am only using docker and I've pulled 'docker pull heartexlabs/label-studio:latest' but it doesn't appear to have &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/pull/350&gt;#350&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in it. But the code definitively looks better for issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio/issues/358&gt;#358&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .  Thanks!
Do you prefer issues/bug reports or PR's?   Because the latest version of
label-studio/label_studio/utils/schema/data_examples.json could be change to relative paths (this would help my use case), replace all &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;/static with  static

		I'm not sure that it's a good idea to exclude HOSTNAME from there. Because if you use ML backend or other external tools then they will not be able to find resource files. So, the better way is to change "host" in config to hostname you use.
