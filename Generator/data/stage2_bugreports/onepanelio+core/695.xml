	<summary>Bug: label filter skips identical keys with different values.</summary>
	<description>
If you have two labels like:

accuracy: 98
accuracy: 99

and you choose accuracy: 98
the other one will not show up in the list anymore.
It should.
This is because we skip labels with identical keys, but it should be identical key/values.

		Actually, this is not an issue. You can not add two labels with different values to the same object.
E.g. you can not have

accuracy: 98
accuracy: 99

on the same object.
So the current behavior is correct.
