		Ways this can happen:
When ARGO_POD_GC_STRATEGY is set to OnWorkflowSuccess and a workflow fails, it does keep the volume.
Otherwise, I tested this with OnPodCompletion (the default) and a failed or successful workflow deleted the volumes.
This might have been related to the Patch https://10.0.0.1:443/api/v1/namespaces/ issue from earlier. Maybe that specific kind of failure prevented the volumes from being terminated. But that was a system error in general. It might be worth pursuing a kind of cron that checks for bad resources, since it would be external to any failures.
I'll keep an eye on this one, but if anyone is able to reproduce it, please post below.

		This looks to be an issue only when we delete clusters and don't delete paused or running Workspaces. Closing for now.
