	<summary>Workflow execution page back button issues</summary>
	<description>

Going directly to a Workflow via a link - the "go to workflows" at the top left does not work.
Cloning a Workflow causes the back button to go to the previous cloned workflow.
Back button does not take you back when you select a Task in a Workflow.
