	<summary>onepanel ui: going from 0 workspaces to creating a new one - the new one does not immediately show up. You have to refresh the page.</summary>
	<description>
This issue includes a couple of parts

When we create a workspace, the UI still believes there are no workspaces at all, so it doesn't update.


This can be fixed by making a request to check if there any workspaces if there are none whenever we do a poll. Note - we can't update the "any workspaces" flag in the poll because there might be filters applied. If there are no filters, it can be.


When we delete a workspace, the status goes to terminating and eventually terminated. So there is a time delay between clicking delete and the eventual delete.


This can be fixed by updating the "any workspaces" flag when we have 0 results and we have no filter.
Alternatively, we could implement a state and keep track of things like - did that one workspace get deleted, etc. However, this is a bit more involved and error prone.

		Another similar issue to this:

Going from 1 to 0 Workspaces, the last Workspace remains unless you refresh

		Also, when going from 1 to 0, this should show the call to action empty view vs "No workspaces found":

		There is code in place for this. More testing is needed to make sure performance isn't impacted.
