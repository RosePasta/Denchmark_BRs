	<summary>Onepanel syncer - tries syncing if already syncing?</summary>
	<description>
If we are syncing a lot of files, and the timer is set to a low enough value, does the syncer retry the sync action while one is already going?
Need to test this, and if it does happen, stop it.

		This has actually already been fixed as part of the v0.13.0 release.
