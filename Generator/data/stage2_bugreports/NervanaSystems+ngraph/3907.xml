	<summary>as_type_ptr doesn't work for TensorIterator::Input/Ouput desc</summary>
	<description>
Hi!
I faced an issue that as_type_ptr doesn't work for this cast: TensorIterator::InputDescription to TensorIterator::SliceInputDescription, similar for another inputs/outputs descriptions. This issue occurs only on Win10 platform. Tested compilers: MSVC 17/19. The reproducer is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph/pull/3906&gt;#3906&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you please take a look?
