	<summary>Add flag to nbench to ensure synthetic tensor data is always positive</summary>
	<description>
Some ops take input tensors which require their content to be all positive (e.g. the variance tensor in BatchNorm). This information isn't queryable by nbench on a per-op basis, and so I would suggest a flag be added to nbench that causes only positive synthetic data to be generated. Possible alternatives would be to add a min/max command line param. in nbench to specify the RNG domain.

		What bad would happen if we just made all of the data positive all the time. I'm not positive but it should be ok. A flag is easy too. I'm not trying to be negative, just wondering.

		Since nbench is meant only for performance testing and not correctness, I would say this is also likely a valid approach.
