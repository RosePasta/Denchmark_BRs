	<summary>Specialize_function adds redundant ops for functions with Split operation</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I found that specialize_function adds GetOutputElement operations after an operation with several outputs.
I created a reproducer here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph/pull/3931&gt;#3931&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It is really unexpectedly for me.
