	<summary>[Bug] DGLSubGraph.map_to_subgraph_nid error in v0.3</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
The method map_to_subgraph_nid from DGLSubGraph seems to malfunction.
The following example code:
import dgl
g=dgl.DGLGraph()
g.add_nodes(10)
h=g.subgraph([0,1,2,5,8])
h.map_to_subgraph_nid([0,8,2])
produces the following error chain:
File “.../python3.6/dist-packages/dgl/subgraph.py”, line 139, in map_to_subgraph_nid
    return map_to_subgraph_nid(self._graph,utils.toindex(parent_vids)).tousertensor()
File “.../python3.6/dist-packages/dgl/graph_index.py”, line 1137, in map_to_subgraph_nid
    return utils.toindex(_CAPI_DGLMapSubgraphNID(subgraph.induced_nodes.todgltensor(),
AttributeError: ‘GraphIndex’ object has no attribute ‘induced_nodes’ 
This bug does not occur in version 0.2 . The main difference I have found was that in v0.2 (in my code), type(h._graph) was
&lt;class ‘dgl.graph_index.SubGraphIndex’&gt;, instead of
&lt;class ‘dgl.graph_index.GraphIndex’&gt; as it is in v0.3 .
Am I using the library incorrectly? Is this behavior intended? If so, is there a replacement for the method?
Or is it a bug?
Thanks!

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jermainewang&gt;@jermainewang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, is there a way I could contribute to fix this issue? This issue prevents me from upgrading beyond 0.2
