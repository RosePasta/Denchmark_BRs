	<summary>multi_update_all with 'stack' reducer</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;ðŸš€ Feature&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Stack order is inconsistent, better to have it consistent.
The shape of the output is not consistent, when there is only one message-type (single frame), the same frame is returned; while for multiple message-types, an additional dimension is introduced.

 We have submitted a patch.
One quick question: after you stack-reduce the per-type (reduced) messages, how would you like to use it?  For instance, would you pass the whole thing through an MLP, or access each per-type reduced message individually (in this case I would suggest to update_all on each edge type individually instead), or maybe something else?

 Thanks for taking care.
For my current use case, I would pass the whole thing through a MLP.
