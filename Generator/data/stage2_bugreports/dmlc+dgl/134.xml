	<summary>[BUG] Loop detected in BatchedDGLGraph, but no loop found in each DGLGraph</summary>
	<description>
I'm running the latest version of TreeLSTM code, but I met a bug when using the built-in topological traversal.
The problem is that, apply  on each graph in the batch does not yield any error, but when it comes to the batched graph, it says loop detected in the given graph.

More specifically, only 995 nodes visited but there are 999 nodes in the batched graph overall. I've checked the edge number and node number of both the batched graph(999, 975) and each graph in the batch, they're both ok.
I guess the problem is with the , could you guys worked on this module please help locate the bug? To reproduce the bug, you may use the code &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yzh119/dgl/tree/bug/examples/pytorch/tree_lstm&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and run .
