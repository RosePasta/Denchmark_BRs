		This is actually because the backend expects both a country code and a country subdivision code (error on my part). Fix incoming…

		Actually, I take that back. This seems to behave inconsistently.

		Ah, when updating the user, it fills in their old country subdivision code if present, which obviously isn't correct if they changed their country…

 The frontend (iso-3166.js) reports there is a district with code CZ-622, but the backend (pycountry) refers to it as CZ-642.

		Based on the official list, this is an error in the frontend library: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:CZ&gt;https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:CZ&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I will see if there is an updated version of the relevant library.

		Nope, the library is just way out of date. Will find a different one, or worst case, export pycountry somehow
