	<summary>Add Key Bindings for Gameplay Speed</summary>

halite 1 allowed you to press 1,2,3,4,5 to change the game speed. It would be super nice to set that up this time as well

		As another option, having a dropdown of some sort to quickly switch between speeds would be awesome.
Just a thought too, I'd bet a lot of money that most people are using only a few of the speeds between 0.5 and 10 - I'd bet on 0.5 and 10 definitely, and probably 2-5 more fuzzily. I'd be fine if 7-9 are gone completely.

 why are we not adding support for 6,7,8,9,10? Can you add that as well?

 okay, but there is no key 10, do you want me to map the key 0 to 10?
