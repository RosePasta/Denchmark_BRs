		Does default bot work? Or is this default bot failing as well?

		the standard bot is working. this error occurs when a large number of ships are simultaneously on the map.

 can you take a look at this?

		Can we get a full traceback of the error? How did you find out this is caused by update map?

		a_times = timeit.default_timer()
game_map = game.update_map()
logging.info(timeit.default_timer()-a_times)
at some point, it takes more than 2 seconds.

Judging by the profile, the readline function is to blame. Please correct!

		One theory would be that the bot didn't send move instructions for one of the turns, so backend isn't sending new map to the bot, so client is stuck waiting for the map from the backend. This assumes no bugs in either backend or python client :P

		Also, readline just reads the line. I mean I could use the c version here, but considering that 2 of the other 4 bots in the game run the same python library and none of them timed out, it's not very likely it's the library...
Could you send me your code so I can take a look?

		<comment id='16' author='julskast' date='2017-10-24T14:38:44Z'>
		I would propose adding check to standard kits that "you ran map update without sending move commands first", regardless of what happens in this issue.

 That sounds like a good idea.

 it seems so it is.
just send a message when waiting for more than a second

		It sounds like you have figured out what is wrong and fixed it. If that is not the case, please reopen and we'll try to figure it out.

		I also noticed game_map.update_map() taking a long time to run. I suspect that the sys.stdin.readline() is blocking until it gets input from the halite engine causing the measured execution time from the perspective of the bot to be too much. Surely the engine counts the "turn time" as starting after the new game state is sent to each bot.

		The  call actually includes the remaining processing time of all active opponents! Whatever you do, do NOT include it in your timeout measurements! This was non-intuitive for me as well, and was stuck for a good couple of days with issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-II/issues/248&gt;#248&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
