 Do you have a screenshot for this: Sign in button falls down on mobile?
And "Reduce font size for table header for nemesis board on mobile (or make it scroll like the rest of the table)" as well, not sure what you mean by this.

. While the page is loading you see a big old mess. Once loaded, looks ok. Solution could be to hide until loaded, etc. vs fully fixing.

About this issue:

Because parsing game is a heavy task, it makes the gif stop spinning. However, there is no event at that time so I can not hook into.
I can change the message 'parsing replay, please wait...' to 'almost done' if you want.
