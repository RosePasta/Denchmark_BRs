 Change "WATCH OUT FEATURED VIDEO" to "WATCH THE LATEST VIDEOS"


 Change "FILTER FOR ALL GAMES" to "FILTER VIDEOS BY PLAYER"


 Change "Usernames" in the dropdown to "Select a Username" since only one is allowed

-[x] If user clicks on a link in the table at the bottom of the page, user should be taken to top of page to see the video


 Link in share widget should contain the game ID of the current video so that they're sharing the video they're watching


 There's no need for the username filter to be full page width - could we reduce the width?
Something that looks like:



 Table breaks on mobile - only 'watch' and 'results' columns should appear on mobile. Same as user profile:
