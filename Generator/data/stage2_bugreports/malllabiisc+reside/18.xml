	<summary>Issue about running the model</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I was trying to run the model with the RiedelNYT dataset. When it processes around 4500 sentences, the program gets killed. I have installed all required libraries with correct versions mentioned in the requirement file and the program works with the GIDS dataset successfully. I am just confused about the error. Could you please give any help? The error is shown as follow:

		It is out of memory error of GPU. Can you try with reduced batch size and dimensions?
