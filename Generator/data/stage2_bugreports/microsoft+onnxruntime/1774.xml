Describe the bug
I want to convert the onnx model from float32 to float16, convert is successful ,but load model failed, I find the pad layer dont be converted  completely, the attribute of value datatype still is float, not my expect float16.
RuntimeError: [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : GENERAL ERROR : Load model from xxxxxxxxxxx.onnx failed:Type Error: Type parameter (T) bound to different types (tensor(float16) and tensor(float) in node ().

		Can you clarify 'attribute of valuedate'? There's a 'value' attribute which is of type 'float' regardless of the input data type, and a 'data' input. Not sure which one you're referring to. Did the conversion incorrectly convert the 'value' attribute to float16?

The Pad layer 'value' attribute is float，the  'data' input is float16

		The 'output' will also need to be float16.

this layer is ok？ but loadding the onnx model is failed，the error info is “ [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : GENERAL ERROR : Load model from xxxxxxxxx.onnx failed:Type Error: Type parameter (T) bound to different types (tensor(float16) and tensor(float) in node ().” do you know why?

		That node looks ok and most likely a different one is the issue. Are you able to share the model?
FWIW it's generally good to give each node a name so that it's easier to debug any issues.

		Just like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/1764&gt;#1764&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this is likely because of an invalid ONNX model. Please upload your model (if you can share it) and I will help you identify the node/layer where the problem lies. You can open a bug against the project that helped you get the model with that information.

		Closing this issue as this is not an ORT issue, rather the ONNX model is invalid as it deviates from spec.

 - Please share your model and I will help you identify the exact issue which you can use to file a bug in the appropriate project. Thanks!
