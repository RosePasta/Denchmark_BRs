 Thanks for reporting. Are you using 'demo.jpg' or the sample test data as sample input? Did you apply the preprocessing step?

		Yes I tried with 'demo.jpg' and wrote/applied preprocessing step in line with the example python code given. Has this model ever been verified with onnx runtime 0.4?

		Thanks Bowen - update from my side - I went through and cleaned up my example to annotate with comments to share with, in process I found and fixed a bug with proprocessing and extracting vals into tensor and now its working as expected. Closing.
