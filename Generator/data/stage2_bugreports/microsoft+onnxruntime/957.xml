	<summary>Tokenizer fails if separators include special characters for regular expression</summary>
	<description>

Last change changed the behaviour of the tokenizer by using regular expression when separators are used to split into words. The code fails if separators such '?', '.' are used. See
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cpu/tokenizer.cc#L99&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/contrib_ops/cpu/tokenizer.cc#L99&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): all
ONNX Runtime installed from (source or binary): github / master
ONNX Runtime version: github / master
Python version: 3.7


Describe steps/code to reproduce the behavior: add a unit test similar to this one &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/test/contrib_ops/tokenizer_test.cc#L322&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/test/contrib_ops/tokenizer_test.cc#L322&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to check separators = special characters into regular expression
Expected behavior
Either a change to allow ?, either a change in the documentation to tell it is not supported
Additional context
The task is to split into sentances (with separators like . ? !)

 The documentation now states that separators are now regex. Therefore, if you want to use one of the regex special characters, they must be escaped. I can add this sentence to the doc. Would that work?

		That should work. I need to confirm. My first try doing that was not successful. I should try again.
