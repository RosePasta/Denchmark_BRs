	<summary>ConvTranspose auto_pad=SAME_UPPER/SAME_LOWER not working properly</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Using ConvTranspose with auto_pad=SAME_UPPER. Program below prints output shape as (1, 1, 4, 4) which is different than the input shape. Should have been the same shape.
But also, node is created with the correct shape(1,1,2,2)and the checker passed. The actual output values indicate auto_pad=VALID is likely used internally.
Urgency
None
System information
Windows 10
ONNX Runtime installed from binary:
ONNX Runtime version: 1.3.0
Python version:  3.5.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
To Reproduce
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from onnx import helper, checker, AttributeProto, TensorProto, GraphProto
import onnxruntime as rt
import numpy as np

X = helper.make_tensor_value_info('X', TensorProto.FLOAT, [1, 1, 2, 2])
W = helper.make_tensor_value_info('W', TensorProto.FLOAT, [1, 1, 3, 3])
Y = helper.make_tensor_value_info('Y', TensorProto.FLOAT, [1, 1, 2, 2])
node_def = helper.make_node("ConvTranspose", ["X", "W"], ["Y"], auto_pad="SAME_UPPER", strides=[1, 1])
graph_def = helper.make_graph([node_def], 'deconv-model', [X, W], [Y])
model_def = helper.make_model(graph_def, producer_name='')

checker.check_model(model_def)
with open("deconv.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(model_def.SerializeToString())

sess = rt.InferenceSession("deconv.onnx")

X = np.arange(2, 6, 1).reshape(1, 1, 2, 2)
W = np.arange(2, 11, 1).reshape(1, 1, 3, 3)

onnx_pred = sess.run(["Y"], {"X": X.astype(np.float32), "W": W.astype(np.float32)})[0]
print(onnx_pred.shape)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
should print (1, 1, 2, 2), prints (1, 1, 4, 4)
