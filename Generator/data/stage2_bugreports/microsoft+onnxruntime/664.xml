		This is in XML in nuget, may be related

&lt;Override PartName="//LICENSE" ContentType="application/octet" /&gt;

, the PR below should resolve the double slashes in the [Content_Types].xml file within the NuGet package.

		I tried the dev nuget and the issue is now resolved, thanks. I also had to remove the 0.3.0 from packages directory, to get rid of the error: it seems VS looks at all the packages trying to read metadata and if it cannot read metadata from an older one does not ignore it!

		Thanks for confirming it's working after cleaning up the NuGet cache -- looks like stale packages can still have impact.
