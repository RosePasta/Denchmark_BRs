	<summary>Python documentation doesn't load style</summary>
	<description>

When ONNX Runtime 1.0 was released, it seems that the documentation page for the python API is replaced by this page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/&gt;https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I found the updated documentation location to be here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/python/index.html&gt;https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/python/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, this page doesn't have any styling and looks like plaintext with links. This makes the API reference harder to use.
Urgency
The documentation is still usable, just not easy on the eyes at all
