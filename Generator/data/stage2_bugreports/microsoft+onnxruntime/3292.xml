	<summary>pytorch Upsampling with align_corners = True</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
On MacOS, the pytorch Upsample layer:
torch.nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2,  mode='bilinear',  align_corners = True)
does not seem to work well with onnxruntime, even if properly exported/tested with torch.onnx and onnx. The option align_corners = False seems to be working fine. I have also tried opset_version=10.
Urgency
It seems to be working on Windows. We are planning to release a Mac version of your software in May 2020 -- this would be fantastic if this could be fixed.
System information

OS Platform and Distribution: MacOS Sierra 10.12.6
ONNX Runtime version: 0.5.0
Python version: 3.6.9
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
GPU model and memory: None

To Reproduce
#create a simple function
import torch
class simple(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(simple, self).__init__()
        self.up = torch.nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2, 
                                    mode='bilinear', 
                                    align_corners = True)
    def forward(self, x):
        output = self.up(x)
        return output

# sanity check
net = simple()
batch_size, channel, dimx, dimy = 2,3,5,7
batch_input = torch.zeros(batch_size, channel, dimx, dimy).float()
output = net(batch_input)


#export the model
import torch.onnx
torch.onnx.export(net,            # model being run
                  batch_input,    # model input (or a tuple for multiple inputs)
                  "model.onnx",   # where to save the model (can be a file or file-like object)
                  export_params=True,        # store the trained parameter weights inside the model file
                  opset_version=11,          # the ONNX version to export the model to
                  do_constant_folding=True,  # whether to execute constant folding for optimization
                  input_names = ['input'],   # the model's input names
                  output_names = ['output'], # the model's output names
                  dynamic_axes={'input' : {0 : 'batch_size'},    # variable lenght axes
                                'output' : {0 : 'batch_size'}})

#test the model
import onnx
onnx_model = onnx.load("model.onnx")
onnx.checker.check_model(onnx_model)

import onnxruntime
ort_session = onnxruntime.InferenceSession("model.onnx")
The above throw an error at the very last step:

RuntimeError: [ONNXRuntimeError] : 10 : INVALID_GRAPH : Load model from model.onnx failed:This is an invalid model. Error in Node: : Node () has input size 4 not in range [min=2, max=2].

Expected behavior
It seems to be working find on Windows 10.

		I remember having &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/2463#issuecomment-568917722&gt;some issues&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 exporting networks with Upsample layers for use with onnxruntime on pytorch 1.3.0 and had to patch it a bit. Since 1.4.0, it seems to be working fine. Could that be related to your issue?

 can you try the latest version of PyTorch to export your model and let us know if you still see the issue?

		&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;On MacOS Sierra 10.12.6&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


latest pytorch stable version:
python: 3.6.9
numpy: 1.18.1
torch:  1.4.0
onnx:  1.6.0
onnxruntime:  0.5.0

The code reproduced in the first post is failing (for opset_version=9,10,11,12)

nightly build:
torch:  1.6.0.dev20200401
onnx:  1.6.0
onnxruntime:  0.5.0

The code reproduced in the first post is failing (for opset_version=9,10,11,12)
Only thing that reliably works on MacOS is Upsampling with the option: mode='nearest'

		Have you tried this with one of the latest ONNXRuntime releases - 1.0+ ?
