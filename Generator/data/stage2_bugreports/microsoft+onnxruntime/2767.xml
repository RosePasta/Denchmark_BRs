	<summary>Packaging with 1.1.0 Releases</summary>
	<description>
Hi, it looks there were some changes with packaging for the 1.1.0 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases&gt;release&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

Linux - was packaged as zip wrapping a tgz, but has since been changed to tgz
Mac - packaged as zip wrapping a tgz
Windows - packaged as zip wrapping a zip

Previous releases didn't have the extra zip wrapper, which seems redundant.
It looks like the Linux release was updated, but this broke downloads. I'm not sure the best approach to solve this, but updating the existing assets will likely break more downloads, so it may make sense to put out a new release with updated packaging.

		We're sorry. Due to limited resource available, we'll fix it in the next release.  FYI &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/faxu&gt;@faxu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
