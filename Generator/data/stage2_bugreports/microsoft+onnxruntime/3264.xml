	<summary>DLL version number of current release is 0.0.0.0</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
In the currently released Windows x64 build onnxruntime-win-x64-1.2.0.zip, the DLL version number of onnxruntime.dll is set to 0.0.0.0 instead to 1.2.x.x.
In addition to that, the version number of local builds of onnxruntime.dll is also set to 0.0.0.0.

Download &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.2.0/onnxruntime-win-x64-1.2.0.zip&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.2.0/onnxruntime-win-x64-1.2.0.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Extract  and view the Windows Explorer properties. The file version number will be 0.0.0.0.
In local builds, open onnxruntime.dll and view the Windows Explorer properties of that file.
Expected behavior
I would expect the version number of onnxruntime.dll to be something like 1.2.x.x.
Local builds should at least contain the first two version numbers.

Sorry, only German screenshot:

		Ok, thank you!
But how could I set the version number (e.g., 1.2) in local builds?
