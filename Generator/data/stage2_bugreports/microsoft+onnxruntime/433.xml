	<summary>when there are few cast connected, the result might be wrong</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
look at the graph below. The input is bool[1, 100], we for example feed it with all True.
Then Cast (to 1) change it to all 1.0.
Then ReduceSum(axes=1) generate results [100.0]
Then Cast(to 9) change it to [True]
Then Cast(to 1) change it to [100.0]
So the last step should not expected, because user would expect: when they want to cast a True to float, the value should be 1.0.
I guess this is caused when Cast is computed, the value is not changed actually, maybe just a cast.

 could you fix this issue with your cast update?

		Just verified the eigen (used in cast op kernel) will not produce the described result, when casting float-&gt;bool-&gt;float. in other word, 100.0 will be cast into 1.0 in this case. Could u send me the model for more debugging processes? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pengwa&gt;@pengwa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thanks!
