	<summary>Missing cuda_provider_factory.h file in release for windows gpu</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Using the release onnxruntime-win-x64-gpu-0.4.0.zip.
Following the example to execute a model using the C API, I couldn't activate the CUDA provider because cuda_provider_factory.h file is missing.
I found a workaround compiling the project myself and copying the generated file into my include folder (also modifying the #include inside the file)
Urgency
No urgency as I found the workaround but it would be easier for future releases.
System information

Windows 10
ONNX Runtime installed from (source or binary): binary
ONNX Runtime version: 0.4.0
Python version: 3.7 (irrelevant)
Visual Studio version (if applicable): 2017
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.1 / 7.1

Thanks and good work
