This PR prompts the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/1714&gt;#1714&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Pass
Additional context
Turns out InferenceSession object is not properly initialized. The test is written in a way that some shared state presence depends on the order of test execution. While what needs to be done to fix it is clear, it is not not clear how it's been working until now.
