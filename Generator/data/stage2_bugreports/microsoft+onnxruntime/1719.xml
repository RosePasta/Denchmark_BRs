Can you attach your py script from the original issue? It is hard to re-write the script from a  screenshot. And I need to script to try and repro.


Also, this is a vanilla test case for Resize op. I am surprised it is failing. I think there must be some other issue that isn't easily visible. Please provide these details to investigate further -
Which version of ORT are you using?
Is it the CPU or GPU package?
And which platform are you running the script ?


Thanks

		Closing this as this seems to be an artifact of local environment issue.
This is a vanilla use-case for the Resize op and there are unit tests covering a very similar case (the only change is the raw data involved) -

 TEST(ResizeOpTest, ResizeOpLineartUpSampleTest_4DBilinear) { 




.
If you haven't resolved this, please re-open with the *.py script attached that we can use to re-pro.
Thanks!
