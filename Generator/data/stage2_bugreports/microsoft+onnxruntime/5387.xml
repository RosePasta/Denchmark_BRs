	<summary>Pre-built release files are missing an include</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The pre-built binaries for both Linux and macOS seems to be missing the header . This files is required since it is referenced in :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/v1.5.1/include/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.h#L8&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/v1.5.1/include/onnxruntime/core/session/onnxruntime_c_api.h#L8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The file  was a renamed (from ) that happened in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/4854&gt;#4854&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The Windows zip archive does contain the header file.
Because of this, the main header file onnxruntime_c_api.h from the release archives on mac and linux cannot be used.
Urgency
none
