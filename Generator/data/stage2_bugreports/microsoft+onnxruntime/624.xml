		What is your ONNX version?

		ONNX from master branch cloned today, this is how I build onnxruntime. The behaviour seems different based on the setting used to compile.
python3.7 ./onnxruntime/tools/ci_build/build.py --build_dir ./onnxruntime/build/linux --config Release --build_wheel --use_mkldnn --use_openmp --use_llvm --numpy_version= --skip-keras-test

		That's the problem. You must use the same one in onnxruntime's submodule.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xadupre&gt;@xadupre&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please reinstall your onnx python package and let me know if the error is gone.

		I did not see any improvment and two others tests were failing:     '^test_averagepool_2d_ceil_cpu.',
'^test_maxpool_2d_ceil_cpu.',. Maybe that's some tests which were renamed. I pull onnx and onnxruntime fomr github this morning.

 , you can't install onnx from your onnx repo, you should install it from onnxruntime's sub folder, so that we can ensure it's the same version used by onnxruntime.

		That's not a common scenario, what if onnxruntime requires a specific runtime and torch another one. What's the difference between onnx from onnxruntime and official onnx?

For end users, they can choose any ONNX release version from 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.  For non-released ONNX versions, we won't support. And it's not possible to do it well.
And, for example, ONNX Runtime v0.2.1 only supports ONNX 1.2 and 1.3. Even ONNX 1.4 is already released, we shouldn't let user use ONNX Runtime with ONNX 1.4. Because they may get unexpected errors.
In your case, you are using a non-released ONNX version. You need to pay your risk. If you want to get all tests passed, then please switch your ONNX version, to the same one in ONNX Runtime's repo.

What's the difference between onnx from onnxruntime and official onnx

We extended the protobuf definition.(aka, model format) . see: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/core/protobuf/onnx.in.proto&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/onnxruntime/core/protobuf/onnx.in.proto&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ok let's close the issue then. The failure is not tested and out of scope.
