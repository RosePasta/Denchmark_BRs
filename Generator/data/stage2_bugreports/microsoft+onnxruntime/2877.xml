	<summary>Android build is failing both on Windows and Linux</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to cross compile for Android both on Windows 10 and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04), and none of them work!
I've downloaded the protobuf last stable branch to cmake/external, and:
On windows, it builds the protobuf successfully but when it goes on, for some reason CMakeFiles\3.16.2\VCTargetsPath.vcxproj is created with  ToolsVersion="4.0" !! which I don't have and have no way to download (VS2010.... )
The cmake insisted on using NVidia NSight. Ok I installed it (though I build for android and don't intend to use Nvidia specific api but whatever). Perhaps this what forces such an old tools version?
command on windows:
build.bat --android --android_ndk_path C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\20.1.5948944 --android_abi arm64-v8a --android_api 27 --cmake_generator "Visual Studio 16 2019"
I tried adding --msvc_toolset 15.00 it didn't change anything.
On Linux, it says a funny thing: "unknown command /home/.../protobuf.cmake". well, indeed, it's a folder. (cmake is in the PATH)
Please help, it's quite urgent for me,
Thanks.

		I am facing the same issue on windows 10. When I try to build, CMake insist to have Nvidia Nsight installed? Is it compulsory to have it installed though I don't want to use it in android?
build.bat --android --android_ndk_path C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\20.1.5948944 --android_abi arm64-v8a --android_api 26 --cmake_generator "Visual Studio 16 2019"
I was able to build an onnxruntime java package but can't use it in android.
Can someone put exactly how can we use onnxruntime in android?
Thanks.

		Right, currently it is failing in the master branch.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/runs/411725399&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/runs/411725399&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you know how to fix it, welcome to submit your pull requests.  Otherwise I'll do it next month.
Thank you

		Thanks for reply &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/snnn&gt;@snnn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Still, one doubt, is it compulsory to have Nvidia Nsight Visual studio installed for the android build?

		I'm sorry but I've just cloned and tried to build by the instructions for Andoird at the bottom of the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/BUILD.md&gt;build instructions page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and it didn't work for me nor on windows or linux.
On windows it first claimed that the protobuf (cmake/externals) folder is empty, and later (after I've poured there the relevant repo) it claimed that git clone protobuf failed since the folder isn't empty (guess why... :) )
On linux (ubuntu 18.04) - again complained that protobuf is empty, and then complained that snap failed on protobuf...
Did I do something wrong?
Thanks

		git clone --recursive
Did you add this flag when doing the clone?

		Silly me. Thanks for pointing this out. However, this does not solve the issue. Now it's the previous error I had.
on Windows:
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime.git --recursive
Then
build.bat --android --android_ndk_path C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\20.1.5948944 --android_abi arm64-v8a --android_api 27 --cmake_generator "Visual Studio 16 2019"
Got:
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (project): ... to get the value of VCTargetsPath: ... onnxruntime\build\Windows\Debug\CMakeFiles\3.16.2\VCTargetsPath.vcxproj ... error MSB8020: The build tools for Visual Studio 2010 (Platform Toolset = 'v100') cannot be found.

, should I look for an additional problem on my side ? everything works for you from clean clone?

		The new build instruction here (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/BUILD.md#Android&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/BUILD.md#Android&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The sub module folder empty issue was fixed by this PR (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/3935&gt;#3935&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
