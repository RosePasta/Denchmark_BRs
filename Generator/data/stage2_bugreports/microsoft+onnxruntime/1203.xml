	<summary>Test failed when building wheel</summary>

I met a problem when running  ./build.sh --config RelWithDebInfo --build_wheel
result:

		is the test failing consistently or it's an intermittent failure?
to disable running tests when building the wheel, use the following build command
./build.sh --config RelWithDebInfo --build_wheel --update --build

the test failed intermittently
i tried to disable the test using that command and build complete
but whether it would work well if i disable the test?

		It should work.
Which test in onnxruntime_test_all fails and why? You'd have to scroll back up in the test output to find the information.

		I believe that test fails due to missing locale on your system.
From the System Requirements section in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/README.md&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/master/README.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Certain operators makes use of system locales. At the very least you will need to install English language package and configure en_US.UTF-8 locale.
For Ubuntu install language-pack-en package
Run the following commands:
locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
Follow similar procedure to configure other locales on other platforms.

		Ok i was able to build onnxruntime with the comment like
./build.sh --use_cuda --cudnn_home /usr --cuda_home /usr/local/cuda --use_tensorrt --tensorrt_home /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ --update --build
it works with --update --build but without it am getting this kind of error

		it works with apt-get install language-pack-en on ubuntu 18.04
