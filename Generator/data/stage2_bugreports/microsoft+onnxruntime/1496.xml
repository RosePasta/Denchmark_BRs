	<summary>Squeeze requires axes attribute bug</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
This line (ORT_ENFORCE(status.IsOK(), "Attribute axes is not set.");) from the squeeze operator seems to indicate a problem when the axes attribute is not set (and is shown as an error when the axes attribute is not provided when using the squeeze operator), but the documentation says that "if axes is not provided, all the single dimension will be removed from the shape."
To Reproduce
Do not provide an axes attribute when using the squeeze operator.
Expected behavior
When the axes attribute is not provided, all single dimensions should be removed from the shape as specified in the documentation and there should be no error asking the axes attribute to be set.
