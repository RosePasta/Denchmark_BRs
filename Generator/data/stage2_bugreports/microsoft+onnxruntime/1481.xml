		You might have missed a step for sourcing environment variables. Could you please follow the steps in the above link? Especially source setupvars.sh step.

		So after you source the setupvars.sh, did you see a message saying OpenVINO environment is initialized?
Can you send me the build output log and also can you send me the output of the command echo $INTEL_CVSDK_DIR?

		ONNX Runtime currently supports OpenVINO version 2019-R1.1. Your environment shows that you have installed version 2019-R2. Please try to build with R1.1.
