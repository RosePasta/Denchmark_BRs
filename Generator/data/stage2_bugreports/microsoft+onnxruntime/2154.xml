	<summary>GENERAL ERROR : GSL: Precondition failure at /onnxruntime_src/cmake/external/gsl/include/gsl/span: 475</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I am running a simple model with the following architecture:
input -&gt; MaxPool -&gt; MaxUnpool -&gt; output
The maxpool has a kernel_size and stride of 2 whereas the input has a shape of 45x45. The MaxUnpooling operation uses the third output_size input
my intended shapes are:
45x45 -&gt; 22x22 -&gt; 45x45
However, when I run this small model, I get the following error:
RuntimeError: Method run failed due to: [ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : GENERAL ERROR : GSL: Precondition failure at /onnxruntime_src/cmake/external/gsl/include/gsl/span: 475
which is not exactly clear. I believe that this is a valid graph so I am not sure if this is a bug in ONNX Runtime or in the model itself.
System information

I am attaching the ONNX file and a reproduction script to this issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/files/3740645/runSpanError.zip&gt;runSpanError.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Can you try one of our nightly python pkgs? We'll be releasing a new version of onnxruntime (1.0) soon (in the next 2 weeks) and it'll be better to use the latest version. I tried the nightly and didn't see this error.

		It seems that the nightly build works on my end. I will close this issue.
If you happen to know which commit resolves this problem, could you point me to the commit?

		I think this is just masked in later releases as some bounds checking is turned off in release builds.
Looking into it. Possibly related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2398&gt;onnx/onnx#2398&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi, can we re-open this issue?
I am still getting this error in ONNX Runtime. despite the fix. I tried running this in the nightly onnx runtime and in the released onnx runtime 1.1. I am attaching the file in question. Can you please confirm whether or not this is a bug? I believe that this is a valid ONNX file.
