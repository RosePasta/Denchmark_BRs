	<summary>Error using output of one model as input for another C#</summary>
	<description>

I would like to use the output of one model as input to another, and avoid data marshaling/copy of large tensors.
Similar to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/2983&gt;#2983&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and I get exception

Exception thrown: 'System.OverflowException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll

The difference is that I re-create the NamedOnnxValue because I want to give it a different name.
Urgency
I am now going to export with a different name and try passing the output as-is without change, hopefully it works otherwise I will update the issue.
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows
ONNX Runtime installed from (source or binary): nuget
ONNX Runtime version: 1.4.0

To Reproduce

Describe steps/code to reproduce the behavior.

NamedOnnxValue inputIds = NamedOnnxValue.CreateFromTensor("input", val.AsTensor&lt;long&gt;());
Where val is DisposableNamedOnnxValue with name "output". I want to change that to "input".
Expected behavior
Easy way to work with intermediate tensors. It is also hard to unit test with "DisposableNamedOnnxValue" and I currently wrap everything.

		There is an interface to update the name of the DisposableNamedOnnxValue and you should be able to re-use that directly. Is that what you are looking for ?

		Yes. I already exported with the expected names but this should do too.
Another question: Is there anyway to moq DisposableNamedOnnxValue? I want to moq the result of Run and test the rest of the code which deals with tensor's ReadOnlySpan.Buffer for example.

		Closing this. There's a separate issue with the question about mocking.
