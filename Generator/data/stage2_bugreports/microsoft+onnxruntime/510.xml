		What numpy version are you using, and how was it installed (conda or pip)? The output from 'conda list' would be helpful to determine this.

		This was fresh install of Anaconda3 I also updated numpy with the same error. This is from conda list:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;numpy                     1.15.4           py37h19fb1c0_0
numpy-base                1.15.4           py37hc3f5095_0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also, I have not install onnx itself because it is giving me error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ pip install onnx

I also updated numpy with the same error.

That would strongly suggest it's an issue with the numpy install. You could try uninstalling and reinstalling numpy. If you can't import numpy into python, the issue is below onnxruntime.

		I can import numpy fine
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ ipython
Python 3.7.1 (default, Dec 10 2018, 22:54:23) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)]

IPython 7.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: import numpy as np
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What about onnx? isn't that a dependency? I guess it has no wheels installs for Windows

		I believe there's a binary install.
conda install -c conda-forge onnx

		<comment id='6' author='dashesy' date='2019-02-22T02:36:12Z'>
		Ok I did pip install --upgrade numpy and now I have numpy-1.16.1 and that fixed the issue. I think you should add numpy &gt;= 1.16 to your requirements

		<comment id='7' author='dashesy' date='2019-02-22T02:39:37Z'>
		conda install -c conda-forge onnx does install onnx, but it also downgrades numpy to 1.15, I wonder why there is a hard requirement to 1.15

		<comment id='8' author='dashesy' date='2019-02-22T02:45:00Z'>
		huh it also downgraded the entire python py37 to py36 (I wonder why conda even allows that!) and installs conda-forge/win-64::onnx-1.1.1-py36_0
What is a working environment to try onnxruntime in Python? what is the suggested Python version, ...?

		hi sorry for replying late:

for onnxruntime numpy issue: yes it is a known issue. upgrading to latest numpy version will solve it. we are looking into it.
for onnx: currently conda-forge did not have a 3.7 protobuf package. We suggest u working on python 3.6 with conda installed 3.5.2 version protobuf library. 3.6.1 protobuf for python 3.6 is also missing some symbols. We are thinking of switching to build protobuf lib on the fly instead of using shipped binary soon. see https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/appveyor.yml for steps.

Thanks ðŸ˜ƒ

		I had the same problem. Uninstalling numpy 1.15.3 and installing numpy 1.16.1 solved it for me (it also solved the segfault issue I was having).

		Started with a miniconda
Installed a py36 conda environment,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;conda create --name py36 python=3.6 anaconda
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and upgraded numpy
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install --upgrade numpy
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then I can install and import both
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install onnx
pip install onnxruntime
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This will get resolved in the latest release coming out soon (few days). Stay tuned.
