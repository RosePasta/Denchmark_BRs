	<summary>Segfault when calling from_xml_path with meshes files</summary>
	<description>
Duplication of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/issues/11&gt;#11&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but I wanted to open a new issue with my .xml. My setup is Ubuntu 16.04, MuJoCo 2.0 and Python 2.7. The .xml file works fine with  example of MuJoCo Pro. Currently, I am able to use call from_binary_path but it is not very convenient since everytime I want to change something in the environment I have to  the binary model from xml.
Here is my &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/tkelestemur/25b57cdb5009d7f24ed1ffd3334f122f&gt;.xml file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I can share my meshes files as well if you want to reproduce.

 they are.
You need to change the  at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tkelestemur/sawyer_mujoco/blob/master/model/sawyer_mujoco.xml#L2&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 line.

		I think this is related to the ABI conflict mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/issues/24#issuecomment-433733298&gt;#24 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I was able to reproduce the segfault in a clone of your repository by setting  in  and changing  to load from the XML path instead of the binary. However, if I launch using  it works correctly. Again, the problem seems to be specific to the GLFW backend, since  also doesn't segfault (although with OSMesa you won't be able to use the viewer).
