	<summary>Segmentation fault when the viewer window is closed.</summary>
	<description>
I run the code about viewing the environment with a policy in "&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/tree/master/dm_control/viewer&gt;https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/tree/master/dm_control/viewer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
" and it works very well.
However, when the episode terminated, it will report "Segmentation fault: 11" in the command window.
