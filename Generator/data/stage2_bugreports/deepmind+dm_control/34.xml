	<summary>Returned observations will be mutated when the environment steps.</summary>
	<description>
from dm_control import suite
import numpy as np

env = suite.load(domain_name="cartpole", task_name="swingup")
action_spec = env.action_spec()
action = np.random.uniform(action_spec.minimum,
                             action_spec.maximum,
                             size=action_spec.shape)
time_step = env.step(action)
obs = time_step.observation['velocity']
print('obs', obs)
for i in range(10):
    time_step = env.step(action)
print('obs', obs)
print('obs_new', time_step.observation['velocity'])
Gives
obs [-0.00617124  0.00592542]
obs [0.65594909 0.9535503 ]
obs_new [0.65594909 0.9535503 ]
So if I obtain observation from the environment, the array will be mutated when the environment steps. I believe that this behavior can cause a lot of trouble for people.
It would be great if something like copy(qvel) can be added instead.
