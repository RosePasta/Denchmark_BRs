	<summary>Asterisks in filenames prevents checkout in Windows environment</summary>
	<description>
Many of the file names in:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/tree/master/dm_control/suite/dog_assets/extras&gt;https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control/tree/master/dm_control/suite/dog_assets/extras&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

contain * symbols, which prevents Windows users from checking out the code. I know Windows is not officially supported, but it seems like up until now it has been possible to get the environment working with a little bit of effort. Is there any chance of renaming these files?
