	<summary>simplenet.cpp has incorrect pooling layer</summary>
	<description>
In call to pooling_forward, pool_indices_memory should appear as 4th parameter.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;net.push_back(pooling_forward(pool_pd, lrn_dst_memory, pool_indices_memory, 
    pool_dst_memory));                                                      
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
