	<summary>Build error on Gentoo hardened</summary>
	<description>
MKL-DNN build error on Sabayon linux. The error is error: "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" redefined.
It just like the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zmap/zmap/issues/7&gt;zmap/zmap#7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .  I just changed the following lines in 
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn/blob/d3835f4df25c3d33a7a2f968c3c9ef26434bfe91/cmake/SDL.cmake#L27-L28&gt;https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn/blob/d3835f4df25c3d33a7a2f968c3c9ef26434bfe91/cmake/SDL.cmake#L27-L28&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

just like this PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zmap/zmap/commit/5e4143973dc71207f087005ee0891b2c86499eae&gt;zmap/zmap@5e41439&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE} -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE")
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE} -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE")
The compile is OK now.
I am not sure whether this is a bug of the cmake files. Should it be merged into upstream?

		Seems like Gentoo changes the default behavior of gcc by putting  into list of the predefined macro. See this thread in &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.gentoo.org/621036&gt;Gentoo Bugzilla&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and similar thread to this bug in &lt;denchmark-link:https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-29982&gt;MongoDB JIRA ticket&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
While the fix is pretty simple and straightforward I am not sure it worth putting in Intel MKL-DNN cause it really relates to some particular OS peculiarity.
Short summary:

(if I read the thread correctly) Gentoo is still evaluating how to proceed with predefining _FORTIFY_SOURCE
MongoDB refuses to apply the patch with -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE, blaming Gentoo's tool chain
zmap applies the patch with -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rsdubtso&gt;@rsdubtso&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, what do you think?

		I am inclined to think that we should not apply this patch. Gentoo should know better than just patching their GCC to add -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE unconditionally.
