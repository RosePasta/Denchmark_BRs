	<summary>examples/simple_net_int8.cpp not working</summary>

Installed the MKL-DNN debian package, and encountered an error when trying to compile an example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;~/p/m/m/examples ❯❯❯ apt list libmkldnn-dev
Listing... Done
libmkldnn-dev/now 0.13~20180406-ga5f6077-1 amd64 [installed,local]
~/p/m/m/examples ❯❯❯ g++ simple_net_int8.cpp -lmkldnn
~/p/m/m/examples ❯❯❯ ./a.out 
status: 5
message: could not create a convolution forward primitive descriptor
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The other examples are fine.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cdluminate&gt;@cdluminate&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
What is the hardware?
Int8 requires the CPU with avx512-bw support, e.g. Skylake server.
For other systems there is a fallback code based on Intel MKL (or Intel MKL-ML binary blob), but if you build Intel MKL-DNN as a standalone library then this fallback is unavailable.
We should probably adjust the example to report more meaningful error message in case of hardware incompatibility...

 My CPU is 7440HQ, which has no AVX512-bw as far as I know. The library was built standalone without MKL or MKL-ML,so I guess the fallback is unavailable.
So this is a issue about a more meaningful error report.
