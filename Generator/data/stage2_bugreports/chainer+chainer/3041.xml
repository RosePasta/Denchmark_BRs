	<summary>Optimizer tries to update uninitialized parameters</summary>
	<description>
MWE: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pastebin.com/DXp4msHx&gt;https://pastebin.com/DXp4msHx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Running the code will result in the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/home/tommi/.pyenv/versions/2.7.12/lib/python2.7/site-packages/chainer/optimizer.py", line 628, in __call__
    g += self.rate * p
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'NoneType'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The issue is that the parameter p above is None due to model.l3 having no initialized parameters yet on the first forward pass.
This happens since when we are using shape placeholders, model.l3.params() returns an empty set, which the optimizer tries to update. An easy fix for this is to write the code as self.l3 = L.Linear(n_units, n_units) instead, but I think it is confusing for Chainer users that this error occurs when using placeholders. Would it perhaps be possible to modify the optimizer so that it will not update links with uninitialized parameters?

		I came across this issue too.
Another way to fix this issue is to modify all hook functions.
This is good because a hook function can be called to do something with a uninitialized param.
