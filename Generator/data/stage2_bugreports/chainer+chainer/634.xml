	<summary>Error? AttributeError: 'numpy.int32' object has no attribute 'ctypes'</summary>
	<description>
I am using windows 7 + cuda 7.5 on chainer 1.4.1.
I have this weird error when try to run example "train_mnist.py" :
File "C:\Anaconda\lib\site-packages\chainer-1.4.1-py2.7.egg\cupy\cuda\module.py", line 65, in call
print _native.get(type(x), _get_ctypes)(x)
File "C:\Anaconda\lib\site-packages\chainer-1.4.1-py2.7.egg\cupy\cuda\module.py", line 29, in _get_ctypes
return x.ctypes
AttributeError: 'numpy.int32' object has no attribute 'ctypes'
I try to debug and it seems that _native.get(type(x)) cannot work when type is numpy.int32 ????
Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

		Just for your information, my system works fine for the branch "fix-imagenet-for-windows", which is chainer 1.3.2. I suspect the error comes from softmax_cross_entropy.py (and/or accuracy.py) because they use int32 for the label to do computation.

		Thank you for trying Chainer. We have already solved this problem in CuPy branch. Could you wait until this branch will be merged in master?
