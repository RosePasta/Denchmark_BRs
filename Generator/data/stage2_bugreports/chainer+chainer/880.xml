	<summary>check_cuda_version and check_cudnn_version failed although compile and link are successful.</summary>
	<description>
check_cuda_version and check_cudnn_version check the version of CUDA and cuDNN respectively by making a temporary cpp file, compiling and linking it.
In some environment, the compiler used is gcc although the extension is .cpp. As checking code does not  return exit code explicitly, the return code can be other than 0 although all procedures are successful. If g++ was used, this problem would not occur because the code return 0 by default.
