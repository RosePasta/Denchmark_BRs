	<summary>Making the CTC function to be the same as Graves 06</summary>
	<description>
In Graves 06, eq.(6) tells that the first line should be taken if l'_s = b or l'_{s-2} = l'_s.
However, in ConnectionistTemporalClassification class of the chainer implementation, only the l'_s = b condition seems to be implemented.
This makes the CTC probability larger when the same label is repeated, then the CTC loss goes smaller, and the network tend to give repeated labels excessively.  We observed slowness of the training process too.
(Supposing that the repeated labels are 'aa', the current implementation allows both 'aaa' and  'a_a' output, however, the Graves 06's paper supposes that only 'a_a' output should be allowed.)

 , on which your code is based, seems to have the same problem.
