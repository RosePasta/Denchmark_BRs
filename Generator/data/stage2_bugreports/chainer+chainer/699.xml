	<summary>Cannot build on MacOS10 under python3</summary>
	<description>
Thank you very much for this useful package! I have been using chainer installed with pip under python3.4 on my MacOS Yosemite machine. Now I need some newer features and I cannot build it with python3.4 from Anaconda. And it is even hard to debug why:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$python3 setup.py install
Unable to find pgen, not compiling formal grammar.
Killed: 9
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It takes quite some time between the second and the last lines.
The machine has  8GB RAM in case.
Under python2.7 build does work.

		This error message is found in setup script of Cython:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/setup.py#L127&gt;https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/setup.py#L127&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you check if you can install cython correctly?

		Thank you very much. Upgrading cython helped. It was either a broken installation, or version compatibility. Solved.
