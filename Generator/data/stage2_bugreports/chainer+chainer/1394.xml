	<summary>FileExistsError at first epoch finished</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;I try the Chainer v1.11.0 on windows 10(64bit). My python is python3.5 on anaconda. I tested the MNIST sample code was obtained from  http://qiita.com/_329_/items/bcc306194d52f7b81b5a. The code was good working at start. However, it stopped when the first epoch had been finished.  The error message is below. Is this error global or depend on windows 10?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Windows is perhaps the only OS on which os.rename cannot override file that already exists.
I now use work-around below.
94  log_path = os.path.join(os.path.join(trainer.out, log_name))
95  if os.path.exists(log_path):
96     os.remove(log_path)
97  os.rename(path, log_path)

		Thank you very much for quick response, and I'm sorry for my late reply.
I fixed the "log_report.py" according to  your reply, I found that the problem had fixed.
Thank you for your help! I'm closing this issue.

		I fixed the implementation in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/1412&gt;#1412&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . As I do not have Windows environment, so does anyone check it with Windows?
