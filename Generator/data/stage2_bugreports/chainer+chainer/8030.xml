	<summary>Installation fails when `CHAINERX_CUDNN_USE_CUPY=1` and cupy is installed in `python3`</summary>
	<description>
When installing ChainerX with option CHAINERX_CUDNN_USE_CUPY=1, the installer seems to find cupyx package by executing a command python -c import "...".



chainer/chainerx_cc/CMakeLists.txt


         Line 154
      in
      a5989bf






 COMMAND python -c "import sys, cupyx; info = cupyx.runtime.get_install_info(); sys.stdout.write(info.get_data_path('include'))" 





However, in some environment such as Ubuntu16.04, the default interpreter of python is python2. When cupy is installed in python3, this command would fail and its error message is not easy to understand.
Adding an additional variable such as PYTHON_EXECUTABLE may be helpful to resolve this issue.
Or, at least it would be useful to explicitly say that "if you specify CHAINERX_CUDDN_USE_CUPY, our installer will see python command" in the documentation.
