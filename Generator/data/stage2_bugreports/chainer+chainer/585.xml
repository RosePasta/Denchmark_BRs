	<summary>cupy.count_nonzero does not work correctly</summary>
	<description>
count_nonzero(x) should return the count of non-zero elements in x. The current implementation is not correct.
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = cupy.eye(4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; cupy.count_nonzero(a)
1
Note that this bug is overlooked because the test also has a bug. testing.shaped_random with dtype=bool almost always returns an array filled by False. It seems a bug of shaped_random(dtype=bool), since it should return a random boolean array. We should fix it, too.
