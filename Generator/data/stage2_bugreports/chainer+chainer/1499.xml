	<summary>ProgressBar iters/sec is too low in CPU mode</summary>
	<description>
The 'iters/sec' speed displayed in the ProgressBar extension seems too low when running a model in CPU mode. I suspect this is due to the use of time.clock() instead of time.time(). time.clock() apparently measures the total time spent in all CPU cores, which can cause the measured time to (sometimes greatly) exceed the wall clock time.
