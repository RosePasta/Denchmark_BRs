	<summary>chainerx.max_pool floating point exception for stride=0</summary>
	<description>
Passing  as  to  causes a crash. The strides should be validated prior to this. This issue was reported by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shinh&gt;@shinh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Reproduction code follows.
import chainerx
chainerx.max_pool(chainerx.random.uniform(-1, 1, (1, 3, 32, 32)), ksize=3, stride=0)
# 48279 floating point exception (core dumped) 
As for reference, Chainer raises a  ZeroDivisionError.

		This is also the case for ksize=0 for which Chainer raises a ValueError. Also, probably applies to convolution.
