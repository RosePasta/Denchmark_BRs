	<summary>`create_huffman_tree` fails when two entries have the same counts in py3</summary>
	<description>
The function uses a priority queue in its implementation. When two entries have the same counts, the queue tries to compare two tuples but it is not possible in py3.
For example, create_huffman_tree({'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}) fails because the function tries to compare (3, ('x', 'y')) and (3, 'z'), and compares a tuple and a str. It causes an error.
