	<summary>Invalid CuPy cache problem with different version of CUDAs</summary>
	<description>
When a user update CUDA, caches of CuPy for old CUDA is sometimes incompatible with new one. We need to check CUDA version and to store kernel cache with its information.
@cosmo__ reported this problem on Twitter. Thank you!
