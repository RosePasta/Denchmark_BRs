	<summary>Empty Sequential has different semantics than other cases</summary>
	<description>
As you can see from below, an empty chainer.Sequential() has different semantics: it wraps an argument with a tuple and return it. If at least one built-in links or functions exist, it returns a single Variable object.
I think it's better to forbid calling an empty Sequential.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import numpy
import chainer
from chainer import functions as F

x = numpy.array([1, 2], numpy.float32)
seq = chainer.Sequential()
ret = seq(x)

print(ret)
print(type(ret))
print(type(ret[0]))
print()

seq = chainer.Sequential(F.tanh)
ret = seq(x)
print(type(ret))
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Result&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(array([1., 2.], dtype=float32),)
&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
&lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;

&lt;class 'chainer.variable.Variable'&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I don't think it's "different".  Chainer functions may return Variable, ndarray, or tuple of them.  Example: F.max_pooling_2d(return_indices=True).

That's because  itself returns such values. That's a different story, I think.
Let me rephrase:
Sequential can be considered as a sequence of transforms. If there are one or more operations, that holds. If there's no operation, one would expect the input is returned as is. But currently this is not the case in empty Sequential.

		What do you think chainer.Sequential()(x0, x1) should return?

I think there's no reasonable result everyone can agree with.
That's why I want to forbid calling an empty .

		Therefore I don't think the semantics is "different".
