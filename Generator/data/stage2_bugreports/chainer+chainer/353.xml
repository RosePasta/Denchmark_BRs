	<summary>XConstant functions whose value is integer cannot access to label attributes</summary>
	<description>
Functions in basic_math which involve operations on constant values (namely, AddConstant, SubFromConstant, MulConstant, DivFromConstant, PowConstVar, and PowVarConst) admit that the constant value is integer. But when we do access their label properties, ValueError is raised because _convert_value_to_string, which is called when creating labels, forbids the value being integer. We should allow broader constant cases.
In the first place, it could be inappropriate to check the type of the constant value in constant_value_to_string. I think we should check the type in instantiation.
