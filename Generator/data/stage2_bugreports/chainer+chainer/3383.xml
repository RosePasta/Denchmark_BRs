		Additionally, this test takes too much time (21.5 seconds) in Linux.

		In windows, this test freezes indefinitely.
It's caught in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/blob/master/tests/chainer_tests/iterators_tests/test_multiprocess_iterator.py#L499&gt;this busy loop&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, taking up 100% CPU power.
ing in this loop lowers CPU consumption, but still the test does not end.

		In my environment (Windows 7 + Python 3.6.1), neither parent nor child process receives KeyboardInterrupt.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import subprocess, time, os, signal
try:
    p = subprocess.Popen(["python", "child.py"])
    time.sleep(1)
    os.kill(p.pid, signal.CTRL_C_EVENT)
    while True:
        print("?")
        time.sleep(2)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("PARENT KeyboardInterrupt")

print("PARENT EXIT")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

child.py:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import time
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(2)
        print(".")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("CHILD KeyboardInterrupt")
print("CHILD EXIT")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
