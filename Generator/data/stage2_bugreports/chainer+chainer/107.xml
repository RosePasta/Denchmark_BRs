	<summary>Behavior of 0-dimensional array</summary>
	<description>
Behavior of 0-dimensional array is strange.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x = numpy.array(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
array(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x + x
2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, infix operators of Variable also have the same problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; x = chainer.Variable(numpy.array(1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.data
array(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = x + x
&gt;&gt;&gt; y.data
2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We have two choices:

Forbid 0-dimensional array. Instead use 1-dimension array which has only one element.
Check type of an array in Functions. When an array is converted to a scalar, we need to re-convert the value to 0-dimensional array.

This issue is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/100&gt;#100&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We are assuming that  is  or , but this problem breaks this assumption. (related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/101&gt;#101&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi
You may be able to use numpy.matrix instead of numpy.array.
numpy.matrix does not automatically change its data type as array does.

		Thank you for the suggestion. numpy.matrix is dedicated for two dimensional arrays. I think it's not suited as the basic array type of Chainer, since we sometimes have to use arrays with more than two dimensions (e.g. a batch of images has four dimensions). I think converting between numpy.matrix and numpy.ndarray is as cumbersome as converting between scalars and numpy.ndarray.

		I  understand the situation. It  seems inappropriate to use matrix type. Please forget it.
