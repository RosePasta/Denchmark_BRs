	<summary>CaffeFunction cannot be pickled</summary>
	<description>
Some attributes (forwards, layers and variables) of CaffeFunction cannot be pickled directly. We have to provide a customized pickling methods (e.g. __getstate__ and __setstate__).

		Do you mind showing any example of how to make the pickling work? I am getting this error message, "ReferenceError: weakly-referenced object no longer exists".
**Just to provide an update: CaffeFunction can be fully pickled using dill (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill&gt;https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), an improved variant of pickle
