	<summary>Errors in numpy-cupy comparison tests are ignored if accept_error=True by default</summary>
	<description>
 has decorators for comparing results from numpy and cupy functions such as . In these decorators,  by default, so even if test code has typo or access to undefined names, they would pass. Such decorators are used everywhere without specifying : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=numpy_cupy_array_equal&amp;type=Code&gt;https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=numpy_cupy_array_equal&amp;type=Code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For example, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/1404&gt;#1404&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has typo in test code, calling  instead of , but the tests pass. I suppose errors should not be ignored by default. It would be better to have users to specify which type of errors should be accepted.

		It is a good suggestion. How about making default value False, or adding an argument specifying acceptable error type?
