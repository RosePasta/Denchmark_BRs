	<summary>Console log does not display correctly in windows7</summary>

ANSI escape code (ex. \033[J) is used in logging function (ex. progress_bar), and the text which contains ANSI escape code cannot display correctly in windows (except windows10) console view.
if you have counter-measure, please fix this problem.
