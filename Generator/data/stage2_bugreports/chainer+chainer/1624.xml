	<summary>Function.backward's docstring says it returns tuple but some functions don't</summary>
	<description>
's docstring says it returns tuple: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/blob/79fbe0338023a8ccab82d71e5dee6171f9b77ad4/chainer/function.py#L362&gt;https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/blob/79fbe0338023a8ccab82d71e5dee6171f9b77ad4/chainer/function.py#L362&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, some functions'  return list, not tuple: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/blob/79fbe0338023a8ccab82d71e5dee6171f9b77ad4/chainer/functions/array/vstack.py#L42&gt;https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/blob/79fbe0338023a8ccab82d71e5dee6171f9b77ad4/chainer/functions/array/vstack.py#L42&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We should fix the docstring to allow other types or fix violating functions.

		It is better to fix functions to return tuples.
