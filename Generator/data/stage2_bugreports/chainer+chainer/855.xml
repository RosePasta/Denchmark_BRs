	<summary>eps is a redundant argument of fixed_batch_normalization</summary>
	<description>
eps is used only when BatchNormalization.forward is called with three arguments. So fixed_batch_normalization does not need eps because it calls forward propagation with five arguments.

		See the comment of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/2149&gt;#2149&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  should add  to the accumulated variance, so it should be fixed in a different way: do not remove  argument and actually use it instead.
