	<summary>Documentation bug report: Some of the descriptions in the tables are truncated.</summary>
	<description>
Some of the descriptions in the tables are truncated, e.g. ,  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.chainer.org/en/latest/reference/functions.html&gt;Standard Function implementations page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I made the following observations.

The docstring for each of them is not truncated and written correctly, e.g. chainer.functions.batch_l2_norm_squared .
The detail page for each of them is rendered correctly, e.g. chainer.functions.batch_l2_norm_squared.
(The docstring for each of them has the word a.k.a.)
