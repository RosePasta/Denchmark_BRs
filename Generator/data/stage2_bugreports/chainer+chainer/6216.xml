	<summary>ChainerX's 2D batch norm raises only for cuda device</summary>
	<description>
Repro:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import chainerx as chx

with chx.using_device('cuda:0'):
    x = chx.array(np.random.rand(2, 5))
    gamma = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
    beta = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
    mean = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
    var = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
    chx.batch_norm(x, gamma, beta, mean, var)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note the above works with native:0

		I succeeded to reproduce it. Is the Traceback the same?
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; import chainerx as chx
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; with chx.using_device('cuda:0'):
...     x = chx.array(np.random.rand(2, 5))
...     gamma = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
...     beta = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
...     mean = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
...     var = chx.array(np.random.rand(5,))
...     chx.batch_norm(x, gamma, beta, mean, var)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
