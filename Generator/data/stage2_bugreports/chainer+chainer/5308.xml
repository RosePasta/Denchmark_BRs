	<summary>SubDataset should inherit the indexing behavior of the original Dataset</summary>
	<description>
Currently the chainer.datasets.split_dataset function returns two chainer.datasets.SubDataset objects which implements the __getitem__(self, index) method defined in chainer.dataset.DatasetMixin.
Therefore, when chainer.datasets.split_dataset is invoked with a Dataset with a custom defined __getitem__(self, index) method (e.g. chainer.datasets.TupleDataset), indexing on the the resulting chainer.datasets.SubDataset will result in a non-expected behavior.
Personally, it would be much easier to use if chainer.datasets.SubDataset inherits the indexing behavior of the original Dataset.
