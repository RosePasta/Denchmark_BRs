	<summary>`gc_interval` never used in `_MultiNodeCheckpointer`</summary>
	<description>
gc_interval seems to be never used in _MultiNodeCheckpointer and to have no effect.
cp_interval is used twice. Possibly one of them should be gc_interval instead?
One more thing I wonder is what this value '5' is intended for:

Why is it 5 rather than 0?

		I think that line should be len(self.files) &gt; gc_interval instead. I think I just missed it during the dev and review process. Thank you for reporting.
Also 5 is kind of safety margin in case of inconsistency or partial lost among workers, in order to
step back to older version of snapshot when snapshot files are partially lacking.

		The team has made a decision to deprecate multinode  ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/8207&gt;#8207&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) and this issue won't be fixed. Instead, please use  ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/8003&gt;#8003&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )  which is more efficient.
