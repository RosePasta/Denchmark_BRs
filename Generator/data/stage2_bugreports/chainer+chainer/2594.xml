	<summary>Cupy fusion bug</summary>
	<description>
(not sure if this is supposed to go in github.com/cupy/cupy yet or if this is still the right place)
This code works:
@cupy.fuse()
def sigsbwd(gy, y1, y2):
    for y in (y1, y2):
        gy = gy * y * (1.0 - y)
    return gy
sigsbwd(gy, *ys) # ys is a list of 2 ndarrays
but this doesn't (the code generator makes two v1 variables, one of which is a &amp;float and the other a float, and nvcc throws an error):
@cupy.fuse()
def sigsbwd(gy, *ys):
    for y in ys:
        gy = gy * y * (1.0 - y)
    return gy
sigsbwd(gy, *ys) # ys is a list of 2 ndarrays
I thought these were syntactically equivalent at the Python level, but I guess fusion is doing some fairly low-level Python manipulation and is tripped up by the varargs.
