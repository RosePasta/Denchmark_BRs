	<summary>NegativeSampling and WalkerAlias do not implement to_cpu()</summary>
	<description>
NegativeSampling implements only to_gpu(). Therefore, self.sampler does not come back to the CPU side even if to_cpu() is called. WalkerAlias also does not have to_cpu().
Currently this causes a problem with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/pull/270&gt;word2vec example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 when loading a GPU-trained model based on negative sampling, which &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/blob/0bab97c584d462e4478f360c26ce427bfe81eb0f/examples/word2vec/train_word2vec.py#L183&gt;has been transferred&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 by  before save by pickle.
