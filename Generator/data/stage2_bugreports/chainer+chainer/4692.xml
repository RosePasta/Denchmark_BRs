	<summary>Type checks in some functions not working as expected</summary>
	<description>
For example, in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/blob/v5.0.0a1/chainer/functions/connection/linear.py#L18-L24&gt;F.linear&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
        type_check.expect(
            x_type.dtype.kind == 'f',
            w_type.dtype.kind == 'f',
            x_type.ndim == 2,
            w_type.ndim == 2,
            x_type.shape[1] == w_type.shape[1],
        )
which does not work when x or W is 1-dim:
&gt;&gt;&gt; chainer.functions.linear(np.arange(10), np.arange(10))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/home/kenichi/Development/chainer/chainer/functions/connection/linear.py", line 245, in linear
    y, = LinearFunction().apply(args)
  File "/home/kenichi/Development/chainer/chainer/function_node.py", line 243, in apply
    self._check_data_type_forward(in_data)
  File "/home/kenichi/Development/chainer/chainer/function_node.py", line 320, in _check_data_type_forward
    self.check_type_forward(in_type)
  File "/home/kenichi/Development/chainer/chainer/functions/connection/linear.py", line 24, in check_type_forward
    x_type.shape[1] == w_type.shape[1],
IndexError: tuple index out of range
because we're checking ndim and shape in the same expect declaration.

		Also fix docs: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.chainer.org/en/stable/guides/type_checks.html&gt;https://docs.chainer.org/en/stable/guides/type_checks.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
