	<summary>Fail to load_npz optimizer</summary>
	<description>
When load optimizer by load_npz, it's failed.
KeyError: '/conv5_3/W/m is not a file in the archive'
I think this is numpy bug.
When the follow code is running, the first character of "/" is dropped.
numpy.savez(f, **s.target)

		Yes, it seems a bug of np.savez/np.load caused by their zip archive nature. We are trying to avoid this issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/878&gt;#878&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
