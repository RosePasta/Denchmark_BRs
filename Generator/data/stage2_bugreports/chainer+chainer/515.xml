	<summary>bug in ptb/download.py</summary>
	<description>
I found that example/ptb/download.py does not work in the following situations:

if python3, we get an error

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "download.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    urllib.urlretrieve(
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'urlretrieve'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


if under proxy, we can not get files ptb.*.txt correctly.
(We get Request Error files.)

Oh, sorry. It's right. We'll fix it.

Did you try to use  environment variable?

		Thanks for quick response.
Yes, I've set http_proxy environment variable.
Actually, I can download it with urlopen method, but not with urlretrieve.
Some people are discussing on how to use proxy with

but it looks complicated...

		Humm, did you set https_proxy? In my environment, urlretrieve also uses http_proxy and https_proxy.

		Please try https_proxy. I'll close this issue. If you cannot download the files with https_proxy, please reopen the issue.
