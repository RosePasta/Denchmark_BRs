	<summary>Serialization of link_hooks.SpectralNormalization fails when layer had been initialized lazily</summary>
	<description>
The link_hooks.SpectralNormalization has a bug the same to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/issues/8441&gt;#8441&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
This is because the link does not have a  if the link has been lazily initialized.
Perhaps it can be fixed in a similar way to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/8445&gt;#8445&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
