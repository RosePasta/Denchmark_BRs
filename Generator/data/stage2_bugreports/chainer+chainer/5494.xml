I found the tests in  take more than 10 min at &lt;denchmark-link:https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pfnet/chainer/builds/19508895/job/20x0p70k42glbu08&gt;https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pfnet/chainer/builds/19508895/job/20x0p70k42glbu08&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The tests are skipped with (AppVeyor, Python 2) in PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/pull/4972&gt;#4972&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it's so slow to timeout.
The issue claims it's also slow with (AppVeyor, Python 3).
