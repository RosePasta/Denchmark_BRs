	<summary>where doesn't work with int16 and float64 on cuda6.5</summary>
	<description>
On only cuda 6.5, this code doesn't work:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = cupy.array([1,2,3], dtype=cupy.int16)
y = cupy.array([1,2,3], dtype=cupy.float64)
c = cupy.array([1,0,1], dtype=cupy.bool_)
cupy.where(c, x, y)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other combinations such as (int16, float32) and (int32, float64) correctly work.
Maybe this is a bug on cuda 6.5, and fixed on 7.0.
Note that cupy.where(c, y, x) can work.

		bool, int8, uint8, int16, uint16 has the same problem.
