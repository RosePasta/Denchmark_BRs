	<summary>"Report to the issue tracker" error on backward with broadcasted var-const operators</summary>
	<description>
It seems binary operators taking a pair of a variable and a constant (***Constant Functions in basic_math.py) do not correctly handle the broadcasting of the variable argument. When the variable is broadcasted, it raises an error on backward with the "report this error to the issue tracker" message.
Here is a minimal code to reproduce this (on the __add__ operator):
import chainer, numpy
x = chainer.Variable(numpy.array(1, dtype='f'))
y = numpy.array([1], dtype='f')
(x + y).backward()
Note that broadcasting of the constant argument is (and should be) allowed for simple coding (e.g., to allow multiplication to any variables by constant scalars). We may have to forbid an implicit variable broadcasting, or correctly support it.
