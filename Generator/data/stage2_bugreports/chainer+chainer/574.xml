	<summary>Cupy indexing behaviour</summary>
	<description>
I mistakenly tried to perform the following indexing operation:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import cupy as cp
x = cp.random.randn(16, 1, 9, 9)
y = x[:, :, (2,2):(7,7), (2,2):(7,7)]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This results in a y with shape (16, 1, 0, 0). In numpy an "IndexError: invalid slice" is raised. Maybe the cupy indexing should check for invalid slices of this kind?

		Thank you for reporting a bug! We'll check the specification of numpy and fix it.
