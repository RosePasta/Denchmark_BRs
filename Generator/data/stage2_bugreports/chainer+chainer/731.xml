	<summary>Cannot upgrade Chainer with old cython</summary>
	<description>
I installed cython=0.22.1 with pip in python 3 environment, and then tried to install chainer with pip, but it failed. This is install log.

And, with setuptools=18.3.2 and cython==0.22.1, it causes infinite loop.

		I also have the same problem but for installing in a new env. Using python 2.7 and cython 0.23.4, I already have installed in a env with python 2.7 but with cython 0.20.1. So i am wondering if is an error of the chainer installer or from cython. But I already uninstalled and installed cython and still the problem.

		This problem is very complicated. Chainer requires Cython (&gt;=0.23) when a user install Chainer. So, we wrote cython==0.23 in setup_requires of Chainer. setuptools checks the requirement of Chainer, and tries to install cython==0.23 if old cython is installed. In this process, setup.py of Cython causes infinite loop or a critical error. But, we didn't understand why setup.py causes error (maybe reloading problem in setuptools).
We decided to distribute .cpp files generated by Cython, and remove Cython from requirements of Chainer in the next release. It may solve this problem. We'll release the next version tomorrow. Please wait.

		We remove dependency to Cython, and we tested this situation. I'll close this issue.
