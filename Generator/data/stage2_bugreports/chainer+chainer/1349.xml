	<summary>Only able to use GPU 0 for chainer computation</summary>
	<description>
I am using centos 6.5 and I have installed chainer. I have also installed cudnn v5 (placed .h and .so files in required places) and also have cuda 7.5 and Nvidia driver 352  installed.
When I try to run chainer code like:
with cupy.cuda.Device(GPU_ID):
.....................................
It works only when GPU_ID = 0. But doesn't work for other GPU's. (I have a total of 10 gpu's on my machine)
I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

I have tried a lot but I am not able to solve this problem. Thank you so much for your help!

		I guess it may have something to do with the device your Variable and model are allocated on. If they are not allocated on the same place, such an error may occur.

		Yes, I tried it a few days ago and it worked after that. But in my past experiments, if I wrote with cupy.cuda.DEVICE(GPU_ID) before using variables, it used to work. Now, I had to explicitly set them to GPU using the method to_gpu.
I don't know why it should behave this way, but it might be due to  the updates that I had installed for cuda  and the driver.
Anyways, thank you for your help   ! &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chenzhekl&gt;@chenzhekl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
