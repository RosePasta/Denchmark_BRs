	<summary>Doc: Color highlighting is lost in chainer.functions.reshape code example</summary>

It's seems the line chainer.utils.type_check.InvalidType: is the source of the problem, but I couldn't find why and how to get it fixed.

		In the below page, it is said that

There is a “highlighting language” for each source file. Per default, this is 'python' as the majority of files will have to highlight Python snippets, but the doc-wide default can be set with the highlight_language config value.
Within Python highlighting mode, interactive sessions are recognized automatically and highlighted appropriately. Normal Python code is only highlighted if it is parseable (so you can use Python as the default, but interspersed snippets of shell commands or other code blocks will not be highlighted as Python).

 Can we close this issue as fixed?
