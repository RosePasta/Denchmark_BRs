	<summary>The behavior of Function#parameters= is inconsistent with FunctionSet#parameters=</summary>
	<description>
At &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/commit/aaf2aae14ad683734964590e6ceee9d775d9d7c5&gt;aaf2aae&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, an assertion was introduced into , which requires the argument  to be a list-like object (implementing  method).
However, this assertion seems to be inconsistent with the behavior of .
 passes the iterator of its argument  to its child functions through , and it causes a TypeError exception.
from chainer import FunctionSet
import chainer.functions as F
func_set = FunctionSet(f=F.Linear(10,10))
params = func_set.parameters
func_set.parameters = params # TypeError: object of type 'tuple_iterator' has no len()
