	<summary>Bad gradients pass gradient check</summary>
	<description>
Even when the computed gradients are wrong, the gradient check tests seem to pass.
This started occurring since merge &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainer/commit/85372a2d909f1649a83aab4fd3c4fab0dfa6e732&gt;85372a2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It is easily reproducible, by simply altering the outputs of some function and then running the corresponding test, noticing that the test still passes.
