	<summary>Possibly wrong doc or code for deconvolution cover_all</summary>
	<description>
The documentation says:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cover_all (bool): If True, all spatial locations are convoluted into
            some output pixels. It may make the output size larger.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, when I prepare a small toy example, the output is larger when cover_all=True. I feel like either the code or the documentation needs to be inverted.
See an &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/LukasDrude/8a9ebbaa3a6ba4ae0e2bef611afefd5a&gt;gist notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the toy example or the attached screenshot. I had set the weight matrices to ones and disabled normalization for clarity.

		Thank you for pointing out the problem. I think this is documentation bug. In Convolution2D, It is true that cover_all=True option makes the output larger than False case. As deconvolution is the inverse operation of convolution, this option should the output smaller.
