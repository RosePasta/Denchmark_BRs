This is because to_gpu does not transfer arrays if they're already on GPU (regardless of devices).
Because of this behavior, it's impossible to assume arrays are on the same device after to_gpu, which is not the case in to_device.
One possible solution is to traverse the tree again after to_gpu to check the devicies, and set device to None if multiple devices are found.
