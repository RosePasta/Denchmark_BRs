	<summary>Pickle error when trying to copy MultiNodeBatchNormalization link</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096&gt;BigGAN&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, they use the standing statistics during evaluation. This can be achieved in chainermn by generating several samples with  mode enabled. Since finetuning changes the running_mean and running_var of the training model, an evaluation copy is required in order to calculate the standing statistics.
The problem is that the MNBatchNorm link does not support copy(mode=copy) and throws
a  TypeError: can't pickle mpi4py.MPI.Intracomm objects error.

		Thank you for reporting! We consider this as a bug and will try to fix, but as next two weeks most of the team members take vacation (in Japan people usually take a longer days off for new-year week celebration) so the fix might be later on, likely January.

		The fix is merged to master and will be included in next release. Feel free to report or reopen if you still have this issue at fixed versions.
