	<summary>The genicam.genapi module leaks memory.</summary>
	<description>
Remarks

This issue should address the genicam2.genapi/genicam.genapi module itself but as a fact, it is not maintained in the GitHub repository and another fact that I'm more or less responsible for the package as well so have decided to create a ticket here as a reminder.
The issue has been reported by a Harvester user and confirmed the reproducibility bu a committee member.

Describe the bug
It is very a few amounts, but the genicam2.genapi/genicam.genapi module leaks memory when a node is referenced.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Refer to an arbitrary node.
See error.

Expected behavior
The genicam2.genapi/genicam.genapi module should not leak memory.
Reminder
As described above genicam2 is a prototype and unofficial; sorry having confused you with this problematic name, that's my fault. We as the GenICam committee has released the official version of the Python binding in November 2019 naming it as simply genicam.

		I will close this ticket once the next version of the genicam package is uploaded to PyPI. Any additional comment is not required since the following plan has been clearly stated. Thank you. /Kazunari
