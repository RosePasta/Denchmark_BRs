	<summary>AttributeError: 'DataStream' object has no attribute 'payload_size'</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Running Harvester version 1 with a GenTL Producer that defines payload size by itself, it gives users the following exception when he tries to start image acquisition:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;in start_image_acquisition buffer_size = data_stream.payload_size.
AttributeError: 'DataStream' object has no attribute 'payload_size'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create an ImageAcquirer object.
Try to start image acquisition.
See error

Expected behavior
An ImageAcquirer object must not raise such an exception if the GenTL Producer supports defining payload size.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

Harvester: &gt;= Version 1.0.0.
GenTL Producer: Euresys, iDS, etc.

Additional context
None.
