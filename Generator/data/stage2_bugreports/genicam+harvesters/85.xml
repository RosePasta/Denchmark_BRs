	<summary>Harvester cannot store the Zip file of the remote device if it's corrupted.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
An environment variable, HARVESTERS_XML_FILE_DIR, was desgined to allow clients can store the XML/Zip file in the remote device when it's downloaded to his side. However, the current implementation does not work in some cases; for example, it is a case where the target file is a Zip file and it's corrpted. In this case, the program will be terminated before storing the downloaded file.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Define HARVESTERS_XML_FILE_DIR and assign a path.
Connect a device which has a corrpted Zip file.
Call the create_image_acquirer method.
You will see the BadZipFile and never see the file in the specified directory.

Expected behavior
Even if the target file is corrpted, Harvester must be able to download and store the target file.
Additional context
None.

		As far as I hear from users, it cannot handle the Windows style directory separtor. Need another investigation. In the meantime, please keep sticking with the forward slash.
