	<summary>Trouble updating statistics</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When the GenTL Producer doesn't  support the "BUFFER_INFO_TIMESTAMP_NS" command the "_gentl.Buffer__get_timestamp_ns(self)" throws an "ErrorException" exception, which is not caught by the try/except. This problem can be solved by adding an except for "gentl.ErrorException" in the except starting in line 84 of statistics.py.
To Reproduce

Connect to camera
Fetch a buffer from an image acquirer.

Expected behavior
ErrorException to be caught.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows10 x64
Python: 3.7
Harvester: 0.2.12
GenTL Producer: sensor2image
Camera: sensor2image gige-server
