Describe the bug
Harvester GUI freezes if the attribute controller is opened while it's acquiring images. It seems to be relevant to the number of nodes that has been displayed/expanded.
To Reproduce

Launch Harvester GUI.
Connect a camera and start image acquisition.
Open the attribute controller.
You'll see Harvester GUI immediately freezes.

Expected behavior
Harvester GUI must not be frozen.
Additional context
You may see the similar phenomenon when you try to expand the node tree clicking the Expand button in the toolbar in the attribute controller.
