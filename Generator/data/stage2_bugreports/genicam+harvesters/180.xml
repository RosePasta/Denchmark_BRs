	<summary>Use genicam==1.0.1 if the Python was version 3.8</summary>
	<description>

It fails to install  from Python 3.8 because due to the change made for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/issues/178&gt;#178&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
; it enforces the installation process to install  even though the package does not support Python 3.8.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

From Python 3.8, execute $ pip install harvesters.
Then you will see the following message.


ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement genicam==1.0.0 (from harvesters) (from versions: 1.0.1)

Expected behavior
For Python 3.8, it should install genicam==1.0.1.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Any
Python: 3.8
Harvester: 1.2.4

Additional context
None.

		As a workaround, I have just uploaded a genicam package that claims it's 1.0.0 but the content itself is 1.0.1 to resolve the Python 3.8 specific installation error. I would like Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 users to keep using the familiar genicam=1.0.0 until the GenICam committee officially releases a package that supports Python 3.8.
