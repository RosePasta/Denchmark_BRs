Start image acquisition.
Strike Ctrl+c.

		I've made some improvements to the design at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/commit/d97e83140a3d42d80a7f151c78984d2235d46e62&gt;d97e831&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I'll wait for feedback from a user. If the improvements meet his expectation, I'll close this issue.
