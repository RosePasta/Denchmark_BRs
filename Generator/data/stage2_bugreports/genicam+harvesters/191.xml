	<summary>Problem with Basler after harvester upgrade</summary>
	<description>
I recently upgraded harvesters from 0.2.5 to 1.2.7. I'm working with Basler cameras, with the latest Pylon SDK (6.12) and my code worked okay before the upgrade. I'm getting an error from create_image_acquirer, here's an interactive session that shows the problem with stack trace at the end
**



from harvesters.core import Harvester
h=Harvester()
h.add_file(r"C:\Program Files\Basler\pylon 6\Runtime\x64\ProducerU3V.cti")
h.update()
ia=h.create_image_acquirer(0)
Traceback (most recent call last):

with io.open(file_path, mode, encoding="utf-8") as f:
ValueError: binary mode doesn't take an encoding argument
**




OS: Windows 10 x64
Python: 3.6.6
Harvester: 1.2.7
GenTL Producer: Basler (cti file is ProducerU3V.cti) for USB3 cameras
Camera:  acA1920

I an switch my virtual Python environment back to the old version and everything works. I'd like to take advantage of the callbacks, though, so I'd like to upgrade my harvesters.
Thanks,

 Hi, Andrew. Thank you for the update. I'm going to close this ticket but please feel free to create/open another ticket if you should have any requests regarding the callback feature. /Kazunari
