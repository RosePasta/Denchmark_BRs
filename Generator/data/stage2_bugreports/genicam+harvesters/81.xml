Describe the bug
The create_image_acquirer raises ValueError with the message which says signal only works in main thread if it's called from the outside of the main thread.
To Reproduce

Define a threading.Thread object that tries to create an ImageAcquirer object calling the create_image_acquirer method.
Instantiate the thread object.
You'll see it raises the ValueError exception.

		Hi, not sure if it is the same issue but I am getting the same exception message "signal only works in main thread". If I run my code on python console it run smoothly, but I am implementing and APIREST interface with falcon+waitress and when calling create_image_acquirer from an on_post method I get that exception.
Python 3.6.8, harvester 0.2.8 (originaly), then I updated to 1.2.0 because of the milestone of version 0.2.10. Same results on both versions.

		I am very sorry! Just updated to 0.2.10 and it worked! I need more work to update to 1.2.0, but I will do in the near future. Thank you very much!
