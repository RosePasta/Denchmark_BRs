	<summary>Harvester GUI crashes if the Attribute Controller widget is opened while it's acquiring images.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Harvester GUI crashes if I try to open the attribute controller widget while it's acquiring images.
One exception is the case where I loaded TLSimu. It doesn't reproduce the phenomenon. It is reproducible only if I loaded a GenTL Producer and connected to a tangible device.
The only workaround that I know is stopping acquiring images just before opening the attribute controller. Once it appeared, you can restart acquiring images.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Launch Harvester GUI.
Load a GenTL Producer.
Start image acquisition.
Try to open the Attribute Controller widget.
You'll see Harvester crashes.

Expected behavior
Harvester must keep working even if we try to open the attribute controller while it's acquiring images.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows 7 and macOS 11.13
Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]
Version [e.g. 22]
