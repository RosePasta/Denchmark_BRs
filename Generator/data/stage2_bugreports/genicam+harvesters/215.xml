	<summary>Using port to write to a register</summary>
	<description>
Describe the issue
I have a custom register in my camera at address 0x00080104, but it's not defined as a node in the XML file.
I am trying to write a value to that register using the Port function.
I use ia.remote_device.port but it throws an exception:
{AttributeError}'NoneType' object has no attribute 'remote_port'
To Reproduce
Write to a register without using it's node reference .
Expected behavior
Write a value to a specific register.

		Hi Kazunari, I will post a screenshot, I think it's the best illustration of the issue.

I have to note that everything works perfectly (acquisition, writing to and reading from nodes).
Thank you.

		Hi Kazunari,
I implemented the changes you have committed, and I'm glad to say that it works.
I'm able to read and write memory using the port function.
Thank you!
