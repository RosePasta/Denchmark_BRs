	<summary>"[Errno 2] No such file or directory:" when looking for .xml file</summary>
	<description>
Hello, first of all a big thanks for the work done in this project.
I have an issue with the newest Baumer GAPI SDK for Ubuntu.
Bug description
It seems that Harvesters joins the temporary directory with the static path to Baumer library files.
I also don't have the libbgapi2_gige.cti_2.10.25111.25119.xml file in that Baumer folder anyway.
If I export the xml file dir as an enviroment variable, the final path used just prefixes it to the static Baumer library path.
Baumer has changed the library folder from '/usr/local/lib/baumer/' to '/opt/baumer-gapi-sdk/lib/' in a recent update.
Edit:
I will install and try the mvImpactAcquire SDK from Matrix Vision as is recommended.
To Reproduce

When I try to create the image acquirer, I recieve the error:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/20200414120524_l6mdyngm/opt/baumer-gapi-sdk/lib/libbgapi2_gige.cti_2.10.25111.25119.xml'
Run export HARVESTERS_XML_FILE_DIR=/opt/baumer-gapi-sdk/lib/ in terminal and I get:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/opt/baumer-gapi-sdk/lib/opt/baumer-gapi-sdk/lib/libbgapi2_gige.cti_2.10.25111.25119.xml'
As test, run export HARVESTERS_XML_FILE_DIR=/ in terminal and I recieve the error:
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/.xml' - it does not seem to join directories now.

A quick workaround seem to be to copy the xml files from another machine to
/home/martin/opt/baumer-gapi-sdk/lib/ and run export HARVESTERS_XML_FILE_DIR=/home/martin/ so the paths work.
Expected behavior
Creation of image acquirer.

 Hi, Martin. Thank you for trying out Harvester for the bug report. Yes, I guess it'd be a bug. I will take a look at that and give you an update once I get some. Till then, sorry for the inconvenience. /Kazunari

 Hi. Just one question: The CTI file you showed me looks like a file for? The name looks like a file for an entity that is defined by the GenTL standard such as System or Interface. I would appreciate it if you could tell me a bit more about what were you trying to achieve with that way.

		Sorry for the late reply. I was just trying to use the camera for capture. The CTI files I use are provided by the Baumer bgapi SDK. I load both the USB and the GiGE files. I sometimes use an USB and sometimes GiGE cameras, so I load both CTI files in the program and just search for cameras connected. Previous versions of bgapi work without a problem. I just provided the path to the file with add_cti_file .
After I run the program, I do have a folder created in /tmp/20200414120524_l6mdyngm/ which contains a xml file probably created and stored by harvesters, but when it tries to access it later, it uses the total filepath the the bgapi library folder between the path to the /tmp folder and the xml name.
It should have just been
/tmp/20200414120524_l6mdyngm/libbgapi2_gige.cti_2.10.25111.25119.xml
instead of
/tmp/20200414120524_l6mdyngm/opt/baumer-gapi-sdk/lib/libbgapi2_gige.cti_2.10.25111.25119.xml
Also this is not a complaint and the problem most likely is that Baumer changed their library location in their new SDK version. I only would like some help to get it to work as seamlessly as before.
