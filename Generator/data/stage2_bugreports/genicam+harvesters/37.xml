	<summary>Image acquisition rate doesn't reach to the expected value</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Image acquisition rate doesn't reach to the expected value we expect. It's prominence especially if the device's transmission rate is high.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Launch the Harvester GUI.
Set AcuiqisitionFrameRate high as much as possible.
Start image acquisition.
Check the image acquisition rate which is displayed in the status bar.

Expected behavior
Of course, there would be a limit which depends on Harvester's performance but we should boost it by applying any possible trick.
Screenshots
None.
Device (please complete the following information):

Width: 2448
Height: 2048
PixelFormat: Mono8
AcquisitionFrameRate: 500
OS: Windows 7

Additional context
None.

		I've made some improvements to the design at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/commit/469be0188b7ebee25e00309a3d179f4bc6fd42fd&gt;469be01&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I'll wait for feedback from a user. If the improvements meet his expectation, I'll close this issue.

		This is just a memo but perhaps we could have been facing an issue regarding the GIL.

		This issue should be handled by the GUI project. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters_gui/issues/1&gt;genicam/harvesters_gui#1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
