&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Posting rules&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Duplicated posts will not be answered. Check the FAQ section, other GitHub issues, and general documentation before posting. E.g., low-speed, out-of-memory, output format, 0-people detected, installation issues, ...).
Fill the Your System Configuration section (all of it or it will not be answered!) if you are facing an error or unexpected behavior. Feature requests or some other type of posts might not require it.
No questions about OpenPose or 3rd party libraries:

OpenPose-related issues should check the official OpenPose GitHub repository.
Caffe errors/issues, check Caffe documentation.
CUDA check failed errors: They are usually fixed by re-installing CUDA, then re-installing the proper cuDNN version, and then re-compiling (or re-installing) OpenPose. Otherwise, check for help in CUDA forums.
OpenCV errors: Install the default/pre-compiled OpenCV or check for online help.


Set a proper issue title: add the Ubuntu/Windows keyword and be specific (e.g., do not call it: Error).
Only English comments.
Posts which do not follow these rules will be ignored, closed, or reported with no further clarification.

After cloning the Repo, after downloading the models and Plugins. Using Unity 2018.1.6.f1(64bit) inside Editor While running the Demo.scene On Unity game view i get only grey image on the canvas and the skeleton sprites are not getting rendered. I am not getting any Errors in console. But when i checked the Gameobjects hierarchy i found it as below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;OpenPose
OrthoCamera
Canvas
     BackgroundImage
     OpenPoseLogo
     FPS
     People
     HumanContainer
          Missing Prefab
          Missing Prefab
          Missing Prefab
          Missing Prefab
          Missing Prefab
    Control
EventSystem
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think the child of HumanContainer Game Object are missing some prefab. I followed and downloaded the Plugins and models and the entire repo multiple times under new Unity project. Still getting only Grey image in the Unity Editor Game view. But the actual OpenPose Release binaries are working with webcam and video input in my system. But OpenPose Unity plugin is not working. Please help how to proceed from current status.

		Missing prefab? I think it might be some linking error in Unity.
Anyway try this: there should be five Human2D_Body25 gameObjects under HumanContainer. The prefab can be found in Assets\OpenPose\Examples\Prefabs. Try replacing the missing prefabs with that.
