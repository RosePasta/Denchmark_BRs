		Hi, I'm sorry for my late reply.
This looks like a bug related to framerate calculation. I will fix it and update here!

		Then I should close the issue.
About low camera FPS, that's already opened in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_unity_plugin/issues/2&gt;#2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We will update in there after it is fixed, we hope to fix that one within the next 1-2 weeks.
Best
