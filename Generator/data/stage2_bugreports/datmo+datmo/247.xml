Based on the above, the following are inconsistent


when the notebook is run with datmo notebook  it is shows “completed run” which makes the user think it is complete, but the result in datmo ls doesn’t match that because it says “NOT STARTED”. If the run was not started then it should say the run was not started


the “notebook” run shows “script” in ls -- this is incorrect, since the original request was to run a notebook as per datmo notebook
