		this is not currently working for all cases
I believe this is tied to the nargs issue. it didn't specifically work when an "nargs" argument liks "--ports" was given right before the positional argument for command
so this would make it fail. You can reproduce with the following

pip install datmo
datmo init
create Dockerfile w/ FROM datmo:xgboost:cpu
run datmo task run --ports 8888:8888 "jupyter notebook"

		the flow above works. although this is likely not expected. one note is that the following does not work:
datmo task run --ports 8888:8888 jupyter notebook. In that case "jupyter" is taken as the command and "notebook" is unrecognized. Assuming we do not want to enable that, I'm closing this issue.
