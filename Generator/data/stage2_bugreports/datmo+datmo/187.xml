	<summary>testing of the main.py function in CLI nonexistant</summary>
	<description>

there is nothing testing the main.py file for the CLI. This means that the tests can all pass BUT the CLI can be non-functional
Solution: either include CLI level testing (which is not ideal) or a python based test for the main.py file
