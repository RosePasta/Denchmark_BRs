 show unstaged changes for the snapshot for each component (code, environment, files)
 remove or clarify "unstaged task ids" --&gt; maybe we can just have a list of all runs here

show if code, environment, or files are unstaged in the status -- latest snapshot is the latest visible snapshot created by the user (could be a discrepancy because unstaged changes are based on all snapshots, not just the visible ones)
changed "unstaged tasks" to "tasks run after the latests snapshot"

		Closed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/datmo/datmo/pull/227&gt;#227&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


separated out latest snapshot by user and auto-generated snapshots.
removed any information about task runs since those will be removed in #226 (may replace with experiments TBD)
show unstaged changes else show the latest snapshot if none
