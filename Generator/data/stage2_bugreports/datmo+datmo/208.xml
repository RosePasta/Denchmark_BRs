	<summary>Removal of built image for the run in controller so that the image with that id doesn't exist after the run</summary>
	<description>
In order to fix this we can

fix environment stop controller to remove any artifacts that are created by the environment driver during the run
add environment stop to a finally statement for the task run controller.
(dependent on #124) we can make the environment stop in the task run not run  if the user passes the detach so it doesn't squash the task
