I am trying to add L2 regularization at the end of s2s() method in prof/s2s.jl and get the mentioned error. The added line is
sumlogp += 0.001 * sum(sumabs2(a) for (k,a) in model if isa(a, KnetArray))

		I will look into this.  In the meantime a workaround is to replace the
dictionary with an array.

		I had a chance to look at this in more detail, there were several problems:

AutoGrad does not support Dict iteration. This can be fixed by:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Base.next{T&lt;:Associative}(a::Rec{T},i) = ((kv,j)=next(a.value,i);(k,v)=kv;(k=&gt;a[k],j))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I will add this to AutoGrad.

isa(a, KnetArray) won't work, you need isa(getval(a),KnetArray). When you index elements of a model AutoGrad changes their type to keep track of dependencies.
Finally this won't work either because the model has a hierarchical structure and not all values are KnetArrays.  If you really want to calculate L2, I'd write a function that explicitly goes through model[:embed1], model[:encode][1], model[:encode][2] etc.

		Fixed in latest AutoGrad master.
