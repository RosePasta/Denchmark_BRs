I'm looking to use deconv4 and noticed it was not setup to handle different output channel size.  The way to fix it is in the function dcdims by replacing the line
...
  elseif i == N-1
            size(w,N)
...
with
...
  elseif i == N-1
            size(w,N-1)
...
The reason for this has to do with using the backward conv4 functions for the forward pass.  This means the input and output dimensions are switched for weights though.  Unfortunately I don't know cudnn good enough to add output_padding like PyTorch does.  Looking into it and will provide a pull request once I figure it out.  I'm currently getting a cudnn error when I try to add it.

		I think we should close this since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/issues/232&gt;#232&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was closed.

 does your implementation fix this?

		Yes, this is a duplicate issue and there should not be any problem right
now.
