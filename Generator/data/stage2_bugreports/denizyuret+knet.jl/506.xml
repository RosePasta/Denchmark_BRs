	<summary>RNN serialization issues</summary>
	<description>
When RNN is trained, gcnode may leave dx.ptr as C_NULL which breaks serialization.
serialize, cpucopy, gpucopy for RNNs not properly tested.

		h.ptr and c.ptr also get garbage collected. reverting back to knetgcnode_old until issue resolved. started dy/rnnser branch to fix. added broken tests. cpu rnn and gpu rnn do not match in new tests!
