	<summary>Universal Sentence Encoder Model runs very slow after embedding large datasets</summary>
	<description>
TensorFlow.js version
2.0.1
Node Version
12.18.0
OS
Windows 7
Prerequisite:
yarn add @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-node @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder
Steps to Reproduce:

Download and unzip debug use model.zip
Run node checktime.js  and note down the time taken to execute
Run node embedlargedata.js, this script will embed large amount of data using universal sentence encoder model (takes around 1 hr)
Run node checktime.js and note down the time taken to execute
You will observe that after embedding large amount of data, the universal sentence encoder model will run very slow even for small datasets.

		This seems to solve the issue:
npm cache clean --force
but I have to do it every time, after embedding large datasets, otherwise it will run very slow

 I think there is a mem leak on the USE model based on the benchmark page.

 I think the issue is that on the benchmark page we get the USE output data as part of the  function, which is unlike all our other models (so the benchmarking script's tensor cleanup mechanism fails to apply to the USE). I sent a fix here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/pull/3510&gt;#3510&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
