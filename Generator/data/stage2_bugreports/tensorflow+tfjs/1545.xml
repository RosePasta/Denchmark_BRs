	<summary>Bug: setting trainable property of tf.LayersModel doesn't set the trainable bit of tf.Variable</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;TensorFlow.js version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

1.1.0
If you set the trainable property of a tf.LayersModel instance to false, all the weights of the model should be set to untrainable (trainable = False) (assuming they are originally trainable). That's not the current behavior though and it needs to be fixed.
