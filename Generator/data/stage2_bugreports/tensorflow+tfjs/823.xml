		As a workaround: Setting client.jasmine.random = true; in the karma.conf.js allows for most tests to complete except the optimizer tests.
When I was console-logging the ext object it seemed to be a WebGL2 extension, in which - I believe - getQueryObjectEXT was renamed to something along the lines of getQueryParameter.
