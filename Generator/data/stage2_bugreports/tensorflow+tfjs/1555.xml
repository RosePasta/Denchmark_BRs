		Keeping the issue open so we remember to try to figure out how to create a test case (note this error only occurs on Linux and has to do with how unused channels are handled).

		Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core/pull/1721&gt;tensorflow/tfjs-core#1721&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Closing since there is a test in layers that catches this issue.
