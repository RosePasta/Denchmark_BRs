	<summary>GatherV2 op missing support for batch_dims parameter</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow.js):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow.js installed from (npm or script link): 2.6.0
TensorFlow.js version (use command below):
Browser version:
Tensorflow.js Converter Version: 2.6.0


The GatherV2 op does not support  param as described in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/GatherV2?hl=en&gt;python API&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

tf.raw_ops.GatherV2(
params, indices, axis, batch_dims=0, name=None
)
indices must be an integer tensor of any dimension (usually 0-D or 1-D). Produces an output tensor with shape params.shape[:axis] + indices.shape[batch_dims:] + params.shape[axis + 1:]
Ref model that is failing due to this missing support &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/4128&gt;#4128&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The GatherV2 API should support batch_dims param.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to

		I have investigated the unstack op, the num parameter has to be same as the dimension of the axis, which means it is not needed.
The issue of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/4128&gt;#4128&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is caused by GatherV2 op not supporting batch_dims parameter, I have verified with this fix, the model can be executed without errors.
