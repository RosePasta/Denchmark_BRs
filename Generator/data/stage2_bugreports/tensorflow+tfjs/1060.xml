	<summary>Fix Keras deserialization when using TF eager mode</summary>
	<description>
When enabling eager mode in the benchmark page (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-layers/pull/396&gt;tensorflow/tfjs-layers#396&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), some params of the mobilenet model get serialized as  which tf.js deserialization doesn't understand.
To reproduce, run the benchmarks in layers after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-layers/pull/396&gt;tensorflow/tfjs-layers#396&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 gets in, and open browser console to see the error.
