Codelab doesn't work as shown
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code to reproduce the bug / link to feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried the codelab. The functions shown there, i wrote them as es6 arrow functions. It didn't work as shown, the regression worked but not accurately (there was a big difference). When i checked the code, only thing different was the function syntax. So i changed it and it works fine. Any ideas why it does that ? because function syntax shouldn't make a difference

I tried es6 arrow functions and it works the same. Can you provide your code snippet?
