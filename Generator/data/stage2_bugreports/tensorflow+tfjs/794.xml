	<summary>Browser crashes after loading Keras model with LSTM layers</summary>
	<description>
Hi there,
A month ago or so I reported an issue, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/738&gt;#738&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which turned out to be a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/218&gt;#218&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Layer Dot seems to have been added to tfjs-layer in version 0.8.2, which is excellent news. Good job guys. This finally loads my model, but after a few seconds the browsers crashes. I get this warning on the console log: ""
I'm using , in . The keras model trained can be found here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jscriptcoder/date-translator/tree/master/jupyter&gt;https://github.com/jscriptcoder/date-translator/tree/master/jupyter&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,  file, and the converted model is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jscriptcoder/date-translator/tree/master/tfjsmodel&gt;https://github.com/jscriptcoder/date-translator/tree/master/tfjsmodel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The Jupyter notebook with the training is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://bit.ly/2Oc14Ce&gt;https://bit.ly/2Oc14Ce&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I'm using Tensorflow 1.10.0 as backend and Keras 2.2.2. To convert the model I used Tensorflowjs 0.6.0.
Thasnks a lot,
Fran

 Thanks for reporting this issue. I am able to reproduce issue, in both the browser and node.js (tfjs-node). We'll look into this bug.
