Hi I'm using Posenet for my project.
After the latest update of Posenet version (from 0.2.3 to 1.0.0), I got an error message like below.
Right now I'm using posenet version 0.2.3 and tensorflow 0.15.3 for my project as it works well with them. So fixing this is not urgent for me, but I'm reporting it here anyway. I hope to use the latest version later. Thx!

		Before getting this error I get
TypeError: t.fromPixels is not a function
This is from this sample page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet#via-script-tag&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet#via-script-tag&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Changing it to t.browser.fromPixels then results in the error reported in this issue.

    &lt;!-- Load TensorFlow.js --&gt;

 &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;img id='cat' src='cat.jpg '/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Place your code in the script tag below. You can also use an external .js file --&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    var imageScaleFactor = 0.5;
    var outputStride = 16;
    var flipHorizontal = false;

    var imageElement = document.getElementById('cat');

    posenet.load().then(function(net){
      return net.estimateSinglePose(imageElement, imageScaleFactor, flipHorizontal, outputStride)
    }).then(function(pose){
      console.log(pose);
    })
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

  are you not getting a tf.fromPixels method changed warning with that version?? what is your work around? after 0.2.3, posenet has 1.0.0 directly

		I wonder if this is related to the various Windows WebGL issues: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1400&gt;#1400&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here the same error appears but specifically in MS Edge: &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55188619/ms-edge-script5022-failed-to-link-vertex-and-fragment-shaders&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55188619/ms-edge-script5022-failed-to-link-vertex-and-fragment-shaders&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Can you run tf.ENV.set('WEBGL_PACK', false) right after you load the TF.js library and let me know if it helps so we can narrow down the problem. Thanks!

		Has this fix propagated to
&lt;denchmark-link:https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs&gt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and
&lt;denchmark-link:https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/posenet&gt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/posenet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I still get the same errors when running the sample code at
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet#via-script-tag&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet#via-script-tag&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Not yet, this fix will go in our next release tfjs@1.0.4 which will come out next week. If you are using posenet, you will have to wait for posenet's next release too, which we plan to do next week as well

Also waiting for this fix. Brings up the question. Does Posenet have some script tag version history? The change to 1.0.0 broke a few of my old examples that use the live link. Would appreciate being able to download an old version while I look into how to make updates. I can probably find an old version using github desktop, but other people might be in the same boat as me.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://hpssjellis.github.io/tensorflowjs-bvh/cam/index.html&gt;https://hpssjellis.github.io/tensorflowjs-bvh/cam/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://hpssjellis.github.io/tensorflowjs-bvh/save-video/index.html&gt;https://hpssjellis.github.io/tensorflowjs-bvh/save-video/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Most of my examples were done around TFJS version 0.11.4. perhaps &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/oveddan&gt;@oveddan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has an old version for us to download.

		Well that was strangely easy.
I was going to fork tfjs-models for posenet , but it said I already had a version, then I was going to put it on cloud9 at &lt;denchmark-link:http://c9.io&gt;http://c9.io&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to compile it, but found an old version, looked in the "dist" folder and found "posenet.min.js". Renamed it and put it on my fork at:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hpssjellis/tfjs-models/blob/master/posenet.v011.min.js&gt;https://github.com/hpssjellis/tfjs-models/blob/master/posenet.v011.min.js&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and my old examples work again :)

		Also looking forward to this fix. The real-time speed of 1.0.0 isn't comparable to 0.2.3. I was planning to launch a product tomorrow using posenet-related work. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dsmilkov&gt;@dsmilkov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you happen to know when exactly 1.0.4 will be released? Thanks!

		So I got my Posenet working with tfjs version 1.0.4, which now does not give the shader error that version 1.0.3 was showing for single-pose, but strangely single-pose seems to not be refreshing the screen. mult-ipose works fine.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/56085758-976b2000-5dfd-11e9-9dd0-c6c465a3591c.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think the issue is probably in the function estimateSinglePose, wondering if this is only for my implementation or if others are seeing this. I also probably have the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1472&gt;CPU fall back&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as my version seems kind of slow.
