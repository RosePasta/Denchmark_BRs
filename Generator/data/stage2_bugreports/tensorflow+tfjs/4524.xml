System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow.js):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow.js installed from (npm or script link):
TensorFlow.js version (use command below): 2.8.1
Browser version:
Tensorflow.js Converter Version: 2.8.1

Describe the current behavior
Reproduce steps:

Turn on simd flag by going to chrome://flag and enable simd option
Run this simple codepen example: https://codepen.io/na-li/pen/XWXqgdM
Error message in developer console: Initialization of backend wasm failed. RuntimeError: abort(both async and sync fetching of the wasm failed). Build with -s ASSERTIONS=1 for more info.

Describe the expected behavior
Expect simd wasm to load successfully. Change above codepen's dependency from 2.8.1 to 2.8.0 to see the normal behavior.
For reference, diff between 2.8.0 and 2.8.1: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/releases/tag/tfjs-v2.8.1&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/releases/tag/tfjs-v2.8.1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
