	<summary>Chrome with Mac Silicon(M1): WebGL: CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL: loseContext: context lost</summary>
	<description>
I'm running &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/TensorFlow%20Deployment/Course%201%20-%20TensorFlow-JS/Week%202/Examples/mnist.html&gt;https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/TensorFlow%20Deployment/Course%201%20-%20TensorFlow-JS/Week%202/Examples/mnist.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and get this error.
The same HTML works without any problem on my Intel MacBookPro Chrome browser.
M1 Silicon Versions:

@tensorflow/tfjs@2.7.0
Chrome Version 87.0.4280.88 (Official Build) (arm64)
macOS 11.0.1 (20B29)

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tfjs@latest:17 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Failed to compile fragment shader.

		just a thought - GPU on M1 platform is not a discrete GPU, it is an integrated one so memory is shared.
TFJS memory usage when using WebGL backend is high, so it's likely OSX that denies Chrome's request for memory allocation.
You didn't mention which GPU is in your Intel-based Mac.
