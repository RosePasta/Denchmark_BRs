	<summary>bug: The `tf.all` operation has incorrect behavior in browser in windows 10</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;TensorFlow.js version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

0.14.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Browser version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Tried it on the following browser in Windows 10:

Chrome 71.0.3578.8
Firefox 63.0.3 (64-bit)
Edge 42.17134.1.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The operation tf.all([0, 1, 1, 1, 1]) incorrectly results in 1. This appears to be the case regardless of how many additional ones you had to the input array. However if they are less than 4 ones then it works fine. I also briefly tested this in tf-nodejs (and the equivalent thing in python) and that works as expected.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code to reproduce the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

See the following &lt;denchmark-link:https://codepen.io/somombo/pen/NEQbGX?editors=0011&gt;live code here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;!-- Load TensorFlow.js --&gt;
    &lt;script 
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.14.0/dist/tf.min.js"&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;

      tf.tensor([0, 1, 1, 1, 1])
        .cast('bool')
        .all() 
        .print() // outputs 1 in browser instead of the 0 that this outputs in nodejs/python 

      tf.tensor([0, 1, 1, 1])
        .cast('bool')
        .all()  
        .print() // however this outputs 0
              
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

 that's odd..
I have also tried in Firefox, Edge and Chrome (updated op with browser versions). I'm using windows 10.
For what it's worth, here is a screenshot of what i'm seeing

 after asking around, a friend who has a mac machine and and one with linux ... it appears those OS's are working fine. However, another friend was able to consistently reproduce this issue on windows 10

		Bug confirmed!
Also: tf.all() fails on Chrome on Windows for every 4 elements added to a 1D boolean tensor.
Using Chrome Version 71.0.3578.80 (Official Build) (64-bit) in Windows 8:
Start with a boolean 5 element 1D tensor. tf.all fails. Keep adding a 0 element. You will find that tf.all fails for every 4 elements (9, 13, 17, 21...) added to the 1D tensor. See image.

		wow thanks for finding that as well &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sblabms&gt;@sblabms&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this is quite peculiar! So to be clear, it works fine if there are any other numbers of zeros except those consistent with that arithmetic sequence. So for example [1,0,0,0,0,1] (for zeros) works and so does [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] (eight zeros) passes the test

, kindly confirm you've been able to reproduce this issue (on windows), so that we can start having productive discussions about potential causes.

 how has the "stable" version v1.0.0 been released when this issue (which is a major bug in my opinion) is still open??
