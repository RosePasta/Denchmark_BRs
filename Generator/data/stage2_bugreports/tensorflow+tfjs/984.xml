	<summary>logs returned by model.fitDataset onEpochEnd got updated by later epoch</summary>
	<description>
The logs returned by onEpochEnd during model.fitDataset will be override by a later epoch. For example:
const trainLogs:Array&lt;{}&gt; = [];
const history =
await model.fitDataset(dataset, {batchesPerEpoch, epochs, callbacks:
{
onEpochEnd: async (epoch, logs) =&gt; {
trainLogs.push(logs);
console.log(trainLogs);
}
}
});
for first epoch it would print something like :
[{"loss":0.9236488342285156}]
for second epoch it would print:
[{"loss":0.7229933540026346},{"loss":0.7229933540026346}]
For model.fit it would be [{"loss":0.9236488342285156},{"loss":0.7229933540026346}]
This can be reproduced by updating any train_dataset_test with above code snippet.
