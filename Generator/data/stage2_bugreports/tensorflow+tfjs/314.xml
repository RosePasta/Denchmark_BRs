	<summary>batchNormalization has different parameter order than tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
Using tfjs-0.11.0, &lt;denchmark-link:https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.11.1/#batchNormalization&gt;tf.batchNormalization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has the parameters: 
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/batch_normalization&gt;tf.nn.batch_normalization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has the parameters: .
variance_epsilon is in a different spot, but more importantly: scale and offset are reversed. This tripped me up for a while when I was trying to port code. This is a backwards incompatible change, so maybe it's better to just add a note to the documentation pointing out that this order is different?

		I feel we should fix this and add note for breaking change in release notes.

		Yeah, this is my fault from a long time ago before we were called TensorFlow. This is a super tricky one because we can swap the order, add a note for a breaking change in the release notes, but it will silently succeed for people depending on this ordering right now.
I'm thinking that this might be a version 1.0 thing since we can break the API and the converter tools / layers will be more mature, so less likely people will use the low-level op directly. For now, we should prioritize adding some big documentation to batchNorm.
