	<summary>Possible typo in tf.layers.reshape API documentation</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.15.3/#layers.reshape&gt;https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.15.3/#layers.reshape&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it currently states "Use the ReshapeLayerConfig field input_shape when using this layer as the first layer in a model."
I'm trying 'input_shape', but that's not working. However, 'inputShape' does work.
I believe that input_shape should actually be inputShape. This also seems to align with the LayerArgs interface, which ReshapeLayerArgs extends from.
