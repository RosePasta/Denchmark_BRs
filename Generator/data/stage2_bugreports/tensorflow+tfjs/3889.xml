	<summary>Sandbox Fails on version 2.2.0 and 2.3.0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;TensorFlow.js version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&gt;= 2.2.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Browser version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Chrome Version 85.0.4183.83 (Official Build) (64-bit)
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Describe the problem or feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Upgrade from TFJS from 2.1.0 to 2.3.0 or 2.2.0 keeps getting "Cannot evaluate flag 'DEBUG': no evaluation function found." when tested on codesandbox.com
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code to reproduce the bug / link to feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is a minimal demo:
Take a look at this simple sandbox:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://codesandbox.io/s/angry-upgrade-4l9pu&gt;https://codesandbox.io/s/angry-upgrade-4l9pu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Now on the left side, update the version to 2.2.0

When you refresh the editor, TFJS errors.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/997157/92436592-a8db6780-f16a-11ea-86dd-83aea935e383.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm not finding anything when googling this issue

		Thanks for the report &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GantMan&gt;@GantMan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i think this is probably related to a bug that should be fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/pull/3848&gt;this pr&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We'll get a
new release out as soon as we can.

		Heya &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tafsiri&gt;@tafsiri&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - I just tested and 2.4.0 has the same bug 
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/997157/94607467-93d19000-0261-11eb-9d82-372f7a685100.gif&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 are you able to reproduce this outside of codesandbox? I tried to reproduce this here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tafsiri/tfjs-parcel-test&gt;https://github.com/tafsiri/tfjs-parcel-test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but didn't get any error (on either 2.3.0 or 2.4.0).
I'm assuming codesanbox is running npm run start (or something similar)?

		I can confirm, this ONLY happens when the code is online through codesandbox.
I'm not sure why ONLY 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 cause this conflict.  That's why I filed it here, rather than with the Codesandbox team.
It might not be a bug with TFJS.  I'm quite unsure what changed between 2.1 and 2.2

		How can we determine/trace what codesandbox does to generate the page that produces that error? The error suggests that the flags.js file in tjfs-core has not been loaded. If there is a bundling step that does tree shaking and it doesn't respect the side_effects property in the package.json of tfjs_core that might cause this error. But we'd need greater insight into the bundling/loading process to see if it's a bug on our end.

		I've reached out to codesandbox - I'll see if I can get us some further info.

		<comment id='9' author='GantMan' date='2020-10-01T17:50:44Z'>
		Hey all! Yep, this is definitely an issue with CodeSandbox, it seems like our transpiler has made the imports out of order, which causes /core to be loaded after the others. I'll look into a fix now.

		Just merged it, it should be live within 30 min!

		This works with 2.4 and even the latest 2.5!   Great work!  Thanks so much &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CompuIves&gt;@CompuIves&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for helping.  Codesandbox is my preferred tool for sharing, demonstrating, and updating TFJS codebases.
I'll close this ticket, as it seems it's 100% working!  ðŸ¥³
