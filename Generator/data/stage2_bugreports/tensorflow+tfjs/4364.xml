	<summary>Resize Bilinear behaves differently</summary>

The problem is the tensorflow python code and the tensorflowjs code use different methods for bilinear interpolation. The tensorflow code uses the half-pixel method while the tfjs code uses two different methods depending on align corners and neither one is similar.

Specific Question
I just looked and it seems  resizing is supported in master? &lt;denchmark-link:https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#image.resizeBilinear&gt;https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#image.resizeBilinear&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is not there but in the master &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/blob/master/tfjs-core/src/ops/image/resize_bilinear.ts#L47&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/blob/master/tfjs-core/src/ops/image/resize_bilinear.ts#L47&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it is. Is it possible somehow to use the master and if so how do build it? Second, if we are able to get this custom layer to work, how do we make sure when we do the tensorflow to tfjs conversion to make sure it calls resizeBilinear in the right way. Additionally, right now by default tensorflow python has half-pixels enabled on (you actually can't turn it off from my understanding) tensorflowjs has it false.
Any help would be appreciated.

 has just been added, if it is still not available in the latest release, it should be in the upcoming release 2.8.0, which will be cut this week.
