	<summary>Vega error from tfjs-vis linechart: Unrecognized transform type: "filter"</summary>
	<description>
We're getting this when trying to render a line chart:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;error.js:2 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Unrecognized transform type: "filter"
    at _default (error.js:2)
    at _default (transform.js:12)
    at data.js:12
    at Array.forEach (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
    at parseData (data.js:11)
    at spec.js:29
    at Array.forEach (&lt;anonymous&gt;)
    at _default (spec.js:28)
    at parseView (view.js:56)
    at Object._default (parse.js:8)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm guessing this has to do with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-vis/blob/master/src/render/linechart.ts#L145&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-vis/blob/master/src/render/linechart.ts#L145&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and 211 and 233.
I'm further guessing there is some transitive dependency issue where the vega-embed that tfjs-vis depends on doesn't actually pull in everything it needs, or the deps are loaded in the wrong order, or some such.
Any ideas?  Thanks!

 could you post a sample of arguments you are calling it with so that I can try and reproduce (including what you are using for opts.yAxisDomain)?
Also could you let me know What versions of tfjs and tfjs-vis you are using.

		Never mind, sorry for the false alarm!  It turned out that a dependency on vega 5 had snuck in to our project.  Since tfjs-vis depends on vega 4, things naturally broke.  Removing our spurious dependency fixes it.
