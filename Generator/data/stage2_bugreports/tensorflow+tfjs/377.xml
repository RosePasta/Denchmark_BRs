	<summary>Failing tests in core regarding local storage</summary>
	<description>
See this &lt;denchmark-link:https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/387154917/log.txt&gt;log&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (search for ) for the test that's failing. The relevant snippet is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Firefox 60.0.0 (Mac OS X 10.12.0) ModelManagement {"BACKEND":"test-cpu"} List models: 1 result FAILEDï¿½[39m
	Expected 2 to equal 1.
	&lt;Jasmine&gt;
	@src/io/model_management_test.ts:110:16 &lt;- src/io/model_management_test.js:149:29
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It consistently fails on Travis on Firefox on Mac OS X 10.12.0 as of couple days ago.

		Here is &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.org/tensorflow/tfjs-core/jobs/386952306#L4134&gt;another log&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from another run. Which exact test fails is flaky since the failure depends on the order of execution.

 description for context. tl;dr when we switched from karma 2.x to 3.x, by default tests run in random order and localstorage tests were not isolated properly. Switching back to non-random order will fix this issue, but nevertheless, it would be good to fix those tests.

 That's good info. However, I don't see how random order by itself may affect the test results. The tests are written in a way that doesn't depend on the order in which the individual s are executed. Is it possible that the tests are executing ? That would explain some of the random failures we have been seeing regarding local storage.

		Chatted offline. I'm fairly certain that tests run sequentially, so I think it's related to not properly cleaning up the local database.

		Pretty sure we don't have tests failing at head now, closing this out.
