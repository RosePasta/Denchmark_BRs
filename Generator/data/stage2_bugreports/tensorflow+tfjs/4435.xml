	<summary>Broken links on "Importing a TensorFlow GraphDef based Models into TensorFlow.js"</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_saved_model&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_saved_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This page contains a link that seems to suggest it has either a description of a Frozen Model (the clickable text is Frozen Model) or a description of how to use one. However, the link appears dead, and simply redirects to the main TF Lite webpage.
Link: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/prepare_models#how_do_you_get_a_model_you_can_use_on_mobile&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/prepare_models#how_do_you_get_a_model_you_can_use_on_mobile&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

There is also a dead link (404) to Session Bundles:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/README.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/session_bundle/README.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Correct links&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am not sure of the correct links that should be substituted in here, or if these links should perhaps be removed entirely.

		Submitted a fix to remove links ,as both saved model and session bundle are deprecated.Thanks for reporting.
