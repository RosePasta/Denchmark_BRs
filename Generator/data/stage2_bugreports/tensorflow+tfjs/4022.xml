	<summary>TensorFlow - Posenet not working properly with React-Native</summary>
	<description>
System information

Mobile device: iPhone 11 Pro
TensorFlow.js installed from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native
TensorFlow.js version:
"@tensorflow/tfjs": "^1.7.1",
"@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native": "^0.2.3"
"react": "16.9.0",
"react-native": "0.61.5"

Describe the current behavior
When using tensorflow and posenet realtime with react-native it does not work correctly. Why? Well, upper body parts are not associating as it should. I tried changing the environmental light and it persists. But ... with lower body parts works perfect.
Something really odd is that we tried out the native option for iOS, and it works wonders, fast and it just grabs the key points, body parts, perfect
[Images attached]
Configuration can be found here: PoseCorrector.txt
Describe the expected behavior
It should recognize the key points on my arms. When is extended, it should show the elbow where the elbow really is, same as wrist, etc.

		It's possible that the input image you are feeding in is too small and that is causing accuracy issues. Try increasing the tensor size you pass to the model to see if that improves accuracy.

		Yes ! I redefined width and height and it really improved !
const inputTensorWidth = 228;
const inputTensorHeight = 300;
Thank you !
