	<summary>fromPixels produces different results in WebGL / CPU if the image element has to be resized.</summary>

WebGL directly uploads the image element to a texture which creates artifacts, while CPU first renders to a canvas.
We should investigate rendering to a canvas in the WebGL backend, or playing with image rendering CSS rules to remove the artifacts.
