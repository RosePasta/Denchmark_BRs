	<summary>tfjs-node: progress bar callback doesn't show enough decimal places for small loss values</summary>
	<description>
Currently the ProgbarCallback, which is activated by default for tf.Model.fit() call in tfjs-node, shows only two decimal places. This leads to uninformative printouts such as "loss=0.00, val_loss=0.00" when the loss values are small.
