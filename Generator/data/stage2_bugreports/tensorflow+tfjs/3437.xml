	<summary>wechat plugin support for tfjs 2.0</summary>
	<description>
This is not a issue but a feature needed.
When can we use facemesh with tfjs 2.0 ? And also the wechat-plugin with tfjs 2.0 ?
Looking forward to it ~: )

		You should be able to use facemesh with tfjs 2.0 today, just make sure to include a backend if you are using tfjs-core directly. Have you tried it and run into a problem?

Thx for the reply. I tried but with wechat plugin.
I guess it is because of the wechat-plugin:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-wechat&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-wechat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

which is not updated to fit 2.0 yet.
