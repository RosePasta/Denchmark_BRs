	<summary>TFJS does not work with converted CenterNet models</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/centernet/resnet50v2_512x512/1&gt;CenterNet model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 works when loaded as  in  using , but fails when converted using  to 
it seems to convert correctly and loads correctly using , but fails during call to :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Uncaught (in promise) Error: All tensors passed to tf.addN() must have the same shape

this is a new error message as code changes from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/pull/4100&gt;#4100&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do fix previously encountered error (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/3903&gt;#3903&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for details), but it seems it's like peeling an onion :)
environment: tfjs built from master dated 10/24/2020 on ubuntu 20.10
