	<summary>Increase BEFORE_PAGING_CONSTANT and enable users to disable paging</summary>
	<description>
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/672&gt;#672&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for context.
We should increase our constant that sets the paging threshold and probably also allow users to override it or disable it. Another idea I discussed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nsthorat&gt;@nsthorat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 would be whether we could detect that a single tensor was larger than this threshold and disable paging if that occurs.

		We increased the value and we now allow users to override it with ENV.set('WEBGL_NUM_MB_BEFORE_PAGING', 1000);
