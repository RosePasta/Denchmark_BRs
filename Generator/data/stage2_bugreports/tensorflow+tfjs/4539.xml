	<summary>Regresssion: WASM fails to load due to _scriptDir not defined</summary>
	<description>
This is a regression in tfjs 2.8.4 compared to 2.8.3
Setting backend to wasm on the main thread results in error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;worker.js onmessage() captured an uncaught exception: ReferenceError: _scriptDir is not defined
  threadPrintErr @ e67a52fd-9fdd-4d80-87b0-5a39d7cd567d:1

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

No issues running TFJS 2.8.3 or older.

		Hi Vladimir,
Thanks for reporting! This is a little bit strange because we did test it in 2.8.4. See this codepin: &lt;denchmark-link:https://codepen.io/jing-jin/pen/BaLqJoE&gt;https://codepen.io/jing-jin/pen/BaLqJoE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If you click "Settings", you can see that the program is loading tfjs core and wasm backend @ 2.8.4.
Could you please provide more context/sample code about this issue? Thanks!

		Ok, this is related to both &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/pull/4392&gt;#4392&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/pull/4528&gt;#4528&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Originally  was not fully minification safe when running through a bundler - minify whitespace and minify syntax were ok, but minify identifiers was not. Then &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/pull/4392&gt;#4392&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixed it and everything was fine for a while.
Now &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/pull/4528&gt;#4528&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (i assume its this one since i don't see other differences) broke it once more and it's even worse since not even minify syntax works anymore.
If I disable minification completely, then yes  works in 2.8.4 - but that is not realistic for production code.
So yes, it's a regression.
If you want to see a simple project, it's at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vladmandic/stocks&gt;https://github.com/vladmandic/stocks&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
