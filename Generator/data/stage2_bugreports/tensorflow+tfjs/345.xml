&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Describe the problem or feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The Tiny Yolo model in TensorFlow.js returns different predictions for the same image on different computers. My tests show that the results may depend on the operating system. The predictions were the same on all Linux computers I checked but different on Windows. The model detected the same classes of objects but differences in probabilities reached several dozen percent.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code to reproduce the bug / link to feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

According to a Twitter conversation with Nikhil Throat, the code can be found here on GitHub: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SkalskiP/ILearnMachineLearning.js&gt;https://github.com/SkalskiP/ILearnMachineLearning.js&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Working demo with "tf.ENV" logged: &lt;denchmark-link:http://i-learn-machine-learning.science&gt;http://i-learn-machine-learning.science&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SkalskiP&gt;@SkalskiP&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 have you found the reason for this difference? we are having a similar problem with Tiny YOLO, a model finds objects running under Windows, but nothing if the page is under Linux, same code and model, same Chrome version, same image, but different results.

 no unfortunately I have not been able to explain this phoneme for now.  If you find any explanation let me know. Please.

		Hi guys, do you still see this problem on 0.13.3?

		Hi! i did a quick check and for me with this version the numbers stay exactly the same.

		I will need some time to reproduce my test on all devices. I will come back to you with the information as soon as possible.

		Hi guys, I can confirm this is still an issue in 0.13.5.
It appears to be webgl related. I switched to the cpu backend and the two results were identical. Interestingly the results in my Linux box didn't change, only the one on windows.

		Hi,
We just got a windows machine with Intel GPU where we can do more testing. Does the problem still persist on tfjs@1.0.2? If yes, if you can send us an up-to-date reproduction, that would be very helpful! Thank you!

		Closing this issue. Let me know if someone can still reproduce this problem using the latest tfjs library.
