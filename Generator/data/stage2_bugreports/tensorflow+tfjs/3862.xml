	<summary>tfjs-models/handpose failing on tf.js 2.3 with</summary>
	<description>
When using the latest version of tf.js (2.3.0 at time of writing), hand pose fails to build with this error:
"node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm/dist/tf-backend-wasm.esm.js:17:1325: Cannot resolve dependency worker_threads"
The GitHub version's package.json has the following versions:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm": "2.1.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl": "2.1.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-converter": "2.1.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-core": "2.1.0"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which work ok.
Replace &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/handpose/package.json&gt;package.json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 versions with these and run  to get the error above:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm": "^2.3.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl": "^2.3.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-converter": "^2.3.0",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs-core": "^2.3.0"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/markstrefford&gt;@markstrefford&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - thanks for reporting this. The issue is the latest TF.js requires a node module , but we did not exclude it from the browser build. This will be fixed in the next release, but in the meantime you can do something like this locally to get around the problem: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/pull/518&gt;tensorflow/tfjs-models#518&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I'm experiencing the issue, also missing perf_hooks when trying to build using webpack (in a project built with vue-cli), the error message is here in case it helps anybody else find this thread. A revert back down to 2.1.0 from 2.3.0 resolved this error for me, but the suggested changes to package.json didn't.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;These dependencies were not found: 
* perf_hooks in ./node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm/dist/tf-backend-wasm.esm.js
* worker_threads in ./node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-wasm/dist/tf-backend-wasm.esm.js
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
