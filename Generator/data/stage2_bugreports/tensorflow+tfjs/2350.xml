	<summary>Posenet demo page has left and right confused (only in single pose mode)</summary>

Displays the green dots further to the other side when I move. Works OK in "multi-pose" mode.

While someone is looking into this perhaps the explanatory text could be improved as well. It refers to a "higher image scale" and yet none of the parameters has a matching name. Is it the "multiplier"?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ToonTalk&gt;@ToonTalk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks again for the report. I think we just need to host the latest PoseNet demo online.
Could you try build and run the demo locally from the latest source to see if it fixes the issue.
Here are the instructions: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet/demos&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet/demos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Best,
Tyler
