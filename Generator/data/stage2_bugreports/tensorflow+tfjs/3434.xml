	<summary>Failed to load @tensorflow-models/speech-commands.min.js.map - Links Broken 404</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;TensorFlow.js 1.7.4&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Below link is broken, throwing 404
In code, this is being called as follows
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/speech-commands"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Which gets translated in browser as below url
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/speech-commands.min.js.map
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
