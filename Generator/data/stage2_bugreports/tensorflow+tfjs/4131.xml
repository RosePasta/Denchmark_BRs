	<summary>facelandmarks-detection wrong when image dimensions change</summary>
	<description>
I am using @tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection: 0.0.2 with wasm backend. I am drawing an image onto a canvas and then using the canvas the classify the landmarks.
The first image is classified fine. But when I classify a second image with different dimensions, the classification is wrong. Example:

When I reload the facedetection model after classifying the first image, the prediction on the second image is correct. So I am not sure if the model is caching something

		You have to remove previous calculated regionsOfInterest between classification of two differents images to prevent this issue:
model.pipeline.regionsOfInterest  = []

 Thanks for the response. So is this expected behavior and not a bug? Is this documented somewhere?
