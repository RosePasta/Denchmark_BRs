&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;TensorFlow.js version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;



&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

Also tried this version:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.15.0&gt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.15.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Browser version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Chrome: Version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit)
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Describe the problem or feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Seems like a bug with coco-ssd example
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code to reproduce the bug / link to feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Fairly new to tensorflow js. and was trying out this example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/coco-ssd/demo/test_inline.html&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/coco-ssd/demo/test_inline.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Getting this error when it goes into model.detect:
tfjs:2 Uncaught (in promise) Error: TensorArray : Could not write to TensorArray index 0,
because the value dtype is int32, but TensorArray dtype is float32.

		Not a bug, just a compatibility problem. While they don't update to the newest tfjs make sure you have the version 0.13.5 .
"dependencies": { "@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd": "0.1.1", "@tensorflow/tfjs": "0.13.5" }
Also a duplicate &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1190&gt;#1190&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for pointing me to version numbers.
Seems like "@tensorflow/tfjs": "0.13.5" did not return any predictions.
It worked with "@tensorflow/tfjs": "0.13.1"
