In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/speech-commands&gt;speech-commands&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 model, when I use  or  function,  I get unnormalized &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/speech-commands/src/types.ts#L408&gt;scores&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


excepted to always get normalized &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/speech-commands/src/types.ts#L408&gt;scores&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 when using  or  function
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/CodePen/any notebook.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
Examples of unnormalized scores: 9.917678198689828e-7, 3.500647105525445e-9
I noticed that I see unnormalized scores when the score is supposed to be around 0
And I see more unnormalized scores with recognize function than with listen function
