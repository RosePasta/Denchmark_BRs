&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Describe the problem or feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The previous PoseNet weights data has disappeared recently. They used to be in the following place.

https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/weights/posenet
e.g. a manifest file has been placed on https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/weights/posenet/mobilenet_v1_075/manifest.json

I cannot run the 3rd party implementations using these data like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rwightman/posenet-python&gt;posenet-python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Will these data be never released again?

 , Thank you for uploading files!
But I failed to download manifest.json using urllib.request.urlretrieve with Python or wget command from &lt;denchmark-link:https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/weights/posenet/mobilenet_v1_050/manifest.json&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/weights/posenet/mobilenet_v1_050/manifest.json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The download itself succeeds, but the contents of the file become strange.
Is there anything I need to do?

		Yes, the contents are gzipped and served with the “content-encoding: gzip” header. You’ll have to unzip them via Python. Let me know how it goes and if you run into any complications.

 , Thank you for your advice.
I was able to get the desired data in the way you taught me.
