&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;TensorFlow.js version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

tfjs@0.14.2
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Browser version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

firefox 65.0 android on a one+ one hardware.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Describe the problem or feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have different result on android than I have on my desktop browser.
The model is a simple keras model specified as tf.float32 input, that contain only a  Conv1d input dim 513, output dim 128, kernel size of 1
On desktop
[[[2.2965181, 1.1961352, 2.0413816, ...
On mobile
[[[2.2964766, 1.196128, 2.0413535, ...
It seems to be consistent with numerical issues linked to doing the computation in half_float (16bits) precision.
In models with more layers, this numerical error adds up, and it becomes total garbage.
How can I force the computation to be done with 32-bits float?
How can I detect the available precision?
Can you point to a tutorial/paper explaining how to modify the architecture/ port the model and retain a semblance of performance?
How can I reduce the precision on the desktop to see what the result would look like on mobile ?
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code to reproduce the bug / link to feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I called it with a tf.ones as input.
Thanks
