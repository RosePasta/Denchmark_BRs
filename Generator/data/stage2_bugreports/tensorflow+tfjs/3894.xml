	<summary>Tensorflowjs-node won't compile with create-react-app (Module not found: Can't resolve 'aws-sdk')</summary>
	<description>
System information

Ubuntu 20.04
TensorFlow.js-node installed from npm:
TensorFlow.js-node version 2.3.0:
Mozilla Firefox 80.0.1

Describe the current behavior
I try to compile with npm start and I get the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Failed to compile.

./node_modules/node-pre-gyp/lib/info.js
Module not found: Can't resolve 'aws-sdk' in '/home/user/projects/draw-digit/node_modules/node-pre-gyp/lib'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Standalone code to reproduce the issue
To start off I simply created a react app with npx create-react-app my-app, then I installed the @tensorflow/tfjs-node npm package, then change the App function to:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;function App() {
  const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs-node");
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Without the const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs-node"); line it works fine. I have tried many things including installing aws-sdk manually but that just leads to many more errors.

 thank you for pointing that out, ignoring the modules with  webpack-node-externals worked!

		hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chihuahua&gt;@chihuahua&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I used the "Usage example" configuration in their GitHub and the error went away, that's when I closed the issue. I spoke too soon though because later I found out the react wasn't working properly even though there were no errors. After that I tried to figure out webpack a little more with no success, but in the I just ended up switching to the regular tfjs.
