 ## TensorFlow.js version
1.1.2.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Browser version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Version 75.0.3770.142 (Official Build) (64-bit)
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Describe the problem or feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running the following Snippet in Chrome Dev Tools I see the following in the console and yet the snippet works fine.
tfjs@1.1.2:2 webgl backend was already registered. Reusing existing backend factory.
t.registerBackend @ tfjs@1.1.2:2
(anonymous) @ tfjs:formatted:10442
(anonymous) @ tfjs:formatted:3
(anonymous) @ tfjs:formatted:4
tfjs@1.1.2:2 cpu backend was already registered. Reusing existing backend factory.

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code to reproduce the bug / link to feature request&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Repeated execution of the following (works fine first time):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs";
document.body.appendChild(script);
script.onload = () =&gt; {
a = tf.data.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
        .shuffle(8)
        .map(n =&gt; n*n)
        .batch(5);
a.forEachAsync(e =&gt; e.print());
};
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I think you have have multiple copies of TensorFlow.js on the page with different versions that are stomping on one another.

		I did (unintentionally) load the same version multiple times (and then when reporting it I did try to switch to the version at &lt;denchmark-link:https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs&gt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but the problem did occur before I mixed versions). Of course one shouldn't load TensorFlow.js more than once but if one does maybe one can be warned instead of this strange behaviour.
I'm unclear why when I closed the tab, opened a new tab the problem occured the first time I tried to load TensorFlow.js -- is there any TensorFlow.js state shared across tabs?
