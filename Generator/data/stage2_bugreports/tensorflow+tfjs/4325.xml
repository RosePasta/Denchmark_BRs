	<summary>missing ops in kernel cause misleading error message</summary>
	<description>
If an op is missing in kernel, error messages printed are not helpful at all.
I have a simple home-made tf.sequential model that works with webgl and cpu backends, but fails with wasm backend:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;backend.ts:665 Uncaught (in promise) Error: 'step' not yet implemented or not found in the registry. This kernel may not be supported by the tfjs backend you have chosen
    at notYetImplemented (backend.ts:665)
    at BackendWasm.step (backend.ts:418)
    at step.ts:48
    at engine.ts:625
    at engine.ts:433
    at Engine.scopedRun (engine.ts:444)
    at Engine.tidy (engine.ts:431)
    at kernelFunc3 (engine.ts:625)
    at engine.ts:639
    at Engine.scopedRun (engine.ts:444)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Finally I've traced it to recurrentActivation set to relu inside a layer instead of default hardSigmoid - you'd never guess that based on the message!
Also, I understand that some ops are not implemented in all kernels, but is there a full matrix of ops per kernel?
Environment: TFJS 2.7.0 in Chrome 87

		update: tested with tfjs 2.8.3, error message has changed but result is still a failure:

 Step op was added to WASM in the latest (2.8.3), can you give it another try, see the error message makes more sense now? thanks

 i've noticed it was added and i've tried, but i can't make sense of the new error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;engine.js:487 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Error running Step: Neither modular kernel nor forward func passed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

note that same code works just fine with webgl backend.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vladmandic&gt;@vladmandic&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the missing op is implemented and merged into our codebase, but hasn't been released yet. I will be in 2.8.4, likely happen later this week.

 thanks - i thought it was released in tfjs 2.8.3, my bad. i'll wait for 2.8.4
