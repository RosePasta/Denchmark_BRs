	<summary>.predict &amp; .execute optional arguments type error</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow.js): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOSX Big Sur
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: n/a
TensorFlow.js installed from (npm or script link): 2.7.0
TensorFlow.js version (use command below): 2.7.0
Browser version: n/a
Tensorflow.js Converter Version: n/a


Using Typescript,  &amp;  require 2 arguments, however in the docs these arguments are shown to be optional – &lt;denchmark-link:https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.GraphModel.execute&gt;https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.GraphModel.execute&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 – This therefore throws an error. I'm hesitant to throw an empty object into  because I can't see how the optional keys inside the object are set, and it's I can't find any documentation passing the default option for  from my model so I can't bypass the typechecking.
Describe the expected behavior
For both model.predict &amp; model.execute I should be able to pass one argument – the tensor inputs and it pass type check,.

		I want to add, I'd do a PR but I want to be sure which is incorrect the type or the docs.

 looks like there is some inconsistency on the predict/execute method between InferenceModel interface and GraphModel.
Can you check if you type the model as tf.GraphModel instead, will the type check pass?

		I've changed it to tf.GraphModel but model.execute still fails with tf.LayersModel.
in training.d.ts line 296 execute is written as –
execute(inputs: Tensor | Tensor[] | NamedTensorMap, outputs: string | string[]): Tensor | Tensor[];
so outputs is still required.

 you can use predict() method with tf.layersModel, the output strings are not required there.

		That would mean the docs are wrong then? as it says execute has an optional argument outputs

 The doc for GraphModel and LayersModel are different, only execute on GraphModel says  is optional, LayersModel is consistent with InferenceModel interface, the  is required argument.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
