	<summary>Nightly benchmark fails due to converter's out-of-date import from tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
This started happening today.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
Run the benchmark:
cd tfjs/integration_tests
yarn benchmark --layers
See the error message that happens when the converter runs:

		This integration test is using nightly TF, but our pip is based on 1.14, we should align otherwise this type issue will happen more often.

 I can make that change.
But in the larger context, this problem needs to be fixed in order to unblock future releases, right?
