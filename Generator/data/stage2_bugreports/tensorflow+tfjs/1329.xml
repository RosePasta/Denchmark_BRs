		There are at least two issues here:


The usage examples mention body-pix@0.0.4, but that version does not exist in npm.  The solution is to remove the version numbers for both tfjs and body-pix, or replace them both with 1.0.0 if you want to pin it.


The image data in your example is subject to CORS restrictions.  Hosting the image file yourself, or grabbing an image from the webcam instead etc., should fix that.
