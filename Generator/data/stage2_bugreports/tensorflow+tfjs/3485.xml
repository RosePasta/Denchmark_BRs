It seems a bug with coco-ssd version and tfjs

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

There is a problem with the coco-ssd and tfjs version, I already check the following issues &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1208&gt;#1208&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/1190&gt;#1190&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and the problems doesn't occur in other versions. Are there incompatibilities with these versions?
I tried these packages too and I got the same problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd": "2.0.2",
@tensorflow/tfjs-core": "1.7.2",
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And I already tried import using script in pure js and html, but I had the same.

		I'm also struggling with this, what combination has worked for you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vvasc&gt;@vvasc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
Mine are these:
"@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd": "^2.0.3",
"@tensorflow/tfjs": "^2.0.1",
"@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl": "^2.0.1",
this is a mess really, how is one supposed to use these, by guessing?

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyu10055&gt;@pyu10055&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i updated coco ssd to 2.0.1 and then last version 2.5.0  but i still have the exact same error as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vvasc&gt;@vvasc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 did.
I am also having tfjs and backends version up to date 2.5.0 but error is still here.
Error happens when executing model (mobilenet fpn v1) on an image.
Do you have any suggestion ? Thank you very much
