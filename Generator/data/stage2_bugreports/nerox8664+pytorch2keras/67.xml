	<summary>Does it also support GPU version models?</summary>
	<description>
For the ResNet18 model, we confirmed that the CPU version of tensorflow, keras works well
But GPU version fails and does not work.
Can we fix the problem on GPU version?

OS: Ubuntu 16.04
Python : 3.6.7
Pytorch: 1.0.0
Tensorflow: 1.12

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pride0723&gt;@pride0723&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
You can always move your GPU model to CPU memory and then convert it. The resulting Keras / Tensorflow model is device-agnostic.
