		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Golbstein&gt;@Golbstein&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Yes, I plan to rewrite graph traverse function. It works for very simple models with PyTorch 1.0.
If you'll send me a log with errors, I can fix it in future.

		Actually I think the problem is with my machine...
When I run this code in my laptop it works (windows) but when I run it on my linux server it throws me "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"  error. Do you know what's that?

		Are you sure that PyTorch and Tensorflow works on your machine? My library doesn't have C-backend or any other low-level operations with memory.
