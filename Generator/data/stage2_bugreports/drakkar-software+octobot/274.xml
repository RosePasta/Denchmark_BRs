		Hi,
You don't have the required config.json file.
You can manually create it by copying the config/default_config.json into your root folder as "config.json".
What command you used to start the "windows.bat" ?
It has to be started in the docs/install/windows location.

		Dear Herklos,

Thank you for your quick answer.
Actually, I used the windows_installer.bat, but it seems that any copy of config.json had been achieved.
I will try to perform the manual copy as you recommand.

Best regards,
Lucky92.

Hi, did you use "OctoBot/docs/install/windows/windows_installer.bat" ?

You don't have the required config.json file.
You can manually create it by copying the config/default_config.json into your root folder as "config.json".

Or you can run windows_installer.bat
