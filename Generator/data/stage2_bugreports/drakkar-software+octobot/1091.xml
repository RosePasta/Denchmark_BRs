	<summary>Cannot install OctoBot on Mac</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step 1: Describe your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS : OSX 10.15.3
Python Version: 3.7.1

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Step 2: Describe the problem:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I started the app from launcher_app_osx. Once I installed OctoBot from the webpage. The terminal returned the erorr as following. Actually I could find binary file "OctoBot" in my directory. Then I tried chmod +x OctoBot but it didn't work and returned the error "exec format error: ./OctoBot". Then I tried to get the url of the binary file download the binary file manually. However, the file I downloaded from the web is named as OctoBot_linux, so I guessed that  you had wrongly uploaded the binary file which is built on Linux OS not on Mac OS. If you have any idea about this please let me know. Thank you very much!

		HI &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/r-hou&gt;@r-hou&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, if you already have python 3.7 installed I suggest you install OctoBot with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/wiki/With-Python-only&gt;python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/wiki/With-PIP&gt;pip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. OctoBot on MAC binary is not maintened anymore.
