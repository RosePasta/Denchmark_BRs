	<summary>dropout_rate=0 fails on autoencoder</summary>
	<description>
In auto_encoder.py there is this line which ensures the dropout parameter is valid. This fails when given 0 dropout due to the default behavior of not including the left bound. Also the param_name is set to alpha, leading to a misleading error message:
Error:
ValueError: alpha is set to 0.0. Not in the range of (0, 1).
Original code:
check_parameter(dropout_rate, 0, 1, param_name='alpha')
Fixed:
check_parameter(dropout_rate, 0, 1, param_name='dropout_rate', include_left=True)
