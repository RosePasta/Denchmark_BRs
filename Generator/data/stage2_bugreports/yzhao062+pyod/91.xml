	<summary>Code inconsistency</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
In the documentation of knn, it is said that : we can choose an algorithm between BallTree, KDTree ,brute-force and auto.
However, The Ball Tree structure is always applied with  decision_function() :
If we train a knn with X_train and the algorithm parameter set to KDTree :
It will evaluate decision_score on X_test with a Ball Tree.
Could you modify the code to allow the use of KDTree or brut-force on the testing dataset.

		Thanks for spotting this. This inconsistency is caused by fixing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/issues/23&gt;#23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
We now force the kNN model to use ball tree to be compatible with more distance metrics. I will update the documentation (and code) soon.
Thanks again.

		By the way, the radius parameter is also not used with the Ball Tree :
I think it can be easily fixed by using the function query_radius() 
instead of  query in the decision_function .
