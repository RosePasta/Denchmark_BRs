	<summary>Tooltips duplicate text of headers</summary>
	<description>
On page for creating a new task, headers have tooltips that duplicate text of headers. This complicates search for useful tooltips.

The following headers have these tooltips:

Name
Image quality
Overlap size
Segment size
Start frame
Stop frame
Frame step

This complicates search for useful tooltips.

What do you mean?

I mean, it would be more convenient to have only useful hints, such as:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54434686/70434060-472f8500-1a94-11ea-8449-d2f6a6ce3830.PNG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And tooltips with duplicate heading text do not carry useful information.
Because of this, in order to get the right advice, you may have to take a look at unnecessary advice.

I do not specify these tooltips (like name, image quality, overlap size, etc.). They are added automatically by a framework which I use.
There are also meaningful descriptions for image quality, overlap size, segment size. To get them you need to hover mouse cursor on an input field, not on a label of the input field.

 Any questions about it?
