	<summary>Failed status when uploading the model</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
We tried to upload our model. We have 4 files which CVAT needs (xml, bin, json and py) but finally we have this type of comment:
"Checking request has returned the "failed" status. Message: Work-horse process was terminated unexpectedly (waitpid returned 139)".
What means this error?
Michael

		Hello,
I had the same issue when I tried to upload my model with OpenVino 2019 R1.1.
I used the 2 files in the archive below with the .bin and .xml returned by the Model Optimizer for the model "faster_rcnn_resnet50_coco_2018_01_28".
The same .json and the .py worked with the .xml and .bin returned by the Model Optimizer for the model
"ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28"

		Adding a new model with files that work after this error causes the new model to appear as it should, along with an empty model with no name and no label, with the "upload date" being the moment of the error.

This both are model of "faster_rcnn_resnet50_coco_2018_01_28".
