	<summary>Using the same attribute for label twice -&amp;gt; Stuck</summary>
	<description>
There is no warning that you are using the same attribute multiple times. This can easily happen when copy, pasting stuff.
Errors I've experienced when doing this:

Job doesnt start up. Instead you can only see the loading screen.
2. Can't exit out of drawing the bounding box.

EDIT: Number two has more to do with large files (3.5Gb) I think. I will further investigate.
Also the one line given makes it extremely uncomfortable to type/paste in labels.
Greetings
