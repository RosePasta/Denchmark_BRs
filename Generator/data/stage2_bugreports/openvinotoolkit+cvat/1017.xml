	<summary>Cannot start TF automatic annotation (module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'GraphDef')</summary>
	<description>
Got not error while building and running the following command:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f components/analytics/docker-compose.analytics.yml -f components/cuda/docker-compose.cuda.yml -f components/openvino/docker-compose.openvino.yml -f components/tf_annotation/docker-compose.tf_annotation.yml up -d --build
But while trying to run auto annotation using RCNN Object Detector Model, got the following error:

Could not fetch inference status for the task 3
Error: Inference status for the task 3 is failed. AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'GraphDef'

Branch: develop
UPDATE(03/01/2020):
[1] Installed TensorFlow version inside docker container is somehow 2.0.
But version 1.15 is mentioned in CVAT Requirements.
When I tried to change the version by typing:
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0
it says,

ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied

[2] Also, recreated the container by removing all the volumes and images by:
docker system prune
but still getting the same error

		I am using the latest version of CVAT but getting the same errors as stated above. I also changed the line pip install tensorflow==1.15.0 so that both the CPU and GPU versions are same.
After rebuilding the dockers again, the error now is: Could not fetch inference status for the task2, Open the Browser Console to get details. On the console, the error is: AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'GraphDef'

I am getting the same error while I run the Tf model,

Hello @nmanovic,
I am getting the same error while I run the Tf model,
Error: Inference status for the task 4 is failed. AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'GraphDef'

@itsharsh and @anujonthemove ,
Were you able to get it running?
Thanks a lot!

No, I wasn't able to get it running. I am unable to run even OpenVINO based models also. I completely removed all the dockers, docker volumes but unable to use auto annotation with CVAT currently.
