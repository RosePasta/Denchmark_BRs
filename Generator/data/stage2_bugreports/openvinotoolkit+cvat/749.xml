	<summary>Error when downloading mask</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I am experiencing an issue when trying to download mask annotations for a dataset. I can correctly visualize the annotations on cvat, and I can also download the annotations as .xml but if i request the mask .png I get this error:
Exception at line 307: input type not supported
CVAT logs show the same thing. Any idea what may be happening?
thanks in advance

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/4sfaloth&gt;@4sfaloth&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you please attach your annotation in xml format?

 thanks for following up and I am sorry for taking so long to respond, but I've been out and with no access to the server machine for the last week.
Here you go (had to zip it for some reason):
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/files/3727820/CvatMaskProblem.zip&gt;CvatMaskProblem.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I had to manually edit the task name and the image names for privacy concerns, but I believe that is not relevant for the case.
Thanks again for following up on this

		I suppose it has been solved somewhere in between, or should be solved by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/1352&gt;#1352&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Feel free to reopen.

		The problem should have been here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools/_mask.pyx#L307&gt;https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools/_mask.pyx#L307&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

as the old mask export implementation used pycocotools to convert polygons to masks.
It was fixed by changing the implementation to use Datumaro and then by disallowing truncated polygons with &lt; 3 points in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/975&gt;#975&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
