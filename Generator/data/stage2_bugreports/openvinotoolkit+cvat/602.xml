	<summary>Polygon editor does not open</summary>
	<description>
Hello, according to the manual (section "annotation with polygons") it is possible to edit the polygon after completing it by double-clicking with pressed Shift.
However, if I hover over the polygon and double-click with pressed Shift, the polygon editor does not open. Instead, the zoom level is reset to the default zoom level.
CVAT version is 0.5

		Further testing showed that this is show specific to my computer/browser (Google Chrome version 75.0.3770.142). In incognito mode and a colleague's computer the functionality worked perfectly. Disabling all extensions and cleaning cache did not help.
Since there is no way that any of the CVAT developers can re-produce this, I think that this issue needs to be closed (unless I can find more information about why this happens on my computer).

This is interesting issue. As far as I known your case is the second. We have came across to this issue once before and we also didn't find the reason, just used incognito mode.

I believe it should be investigated. But we couldn't reproduce it, so, I just don't know what to do.

 , let's keep the bug for a while. I hope to hear more from our community how to reproduce it.

		I am facing a similar issue. The first time I try shift + double click it works just fine. The second time the polygon I am trying to edit goes hidden (radio button keeps the same but it has to be double clicked for the object to go visible again). Then the third time I try it the zoom is reset. I can only make it work again by refreshing the page but then the bug loop restarts.

 Sounds like another issue. In your case probably there are some exceprtions in the browser console, aren't they? Anyway, I would recommend you update CVAT because the version 3.2 is rather old

Regarding the version, I installed CVAT following the guide on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just yesterday from develop branch. Is there any way to get a more recent one?

		Correction: I was getting the version in a wrong way. Opening About tab I get
Server version: 0.6
Core version: 0.5.2
Canvas version: 0.5.2

I installed CVAT following https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md
Installed openVINO following https://github.com/opencv/cvat/tree/develop/components/openvino (downloaded 2019 R3 version from Intel website)
Installed DEXTR following https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/dextr_segmentation/README.md
Then during annotation it happens as I first commented:


I am facing a similar issue. The first time I try shift + double click it works just fine. The second time the polygon I am trying to edit goes hidden (radio button keeps the same but it has to be double clicked for the object to go visible again).

Okay, I checked it.
I get a bit other exceptions:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'drawstart' of undefined

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But behavior looks to be similar.

		Let's close the issue. In new UI probably it is not a problem. Do not hesitate reopen if you still experience it.
