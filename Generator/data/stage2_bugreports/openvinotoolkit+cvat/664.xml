	<summary>Users cannot be deleted (Server error: 500)</summary>
	<description>
Hello, thanks for this annotation tool, it's really useful!

Just curious, how do I erase all the users previously registered? I tried deleting a user in the admin panel, but received an Server error: 500.
Once a user logged in, the next time he wants to log in with another account, how to switch between accounts? I don't see a button on the UI for it.

Thanks very much!

It is a bug.

Use &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080/auth/login&gt;http://localhost:8080/auth/login&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or REST point &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/logout&gt;http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/logout&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. In the future we will add a button to logout the user.

		There are several problems here:

 server error when you try to delete a user.
 I don't see a way to delete a user in REST API (need to re-check)
 New user has all groups now (admin, user, annotator, observer)

Thanks for the clarification.
Per the  issue, I reinstalled Docker on my system and the problem disappeared.
I can also confirm the third problem you mentioned above.

I experimented several times and found out that admin&amp;user groups have the right to create a new task, while annotator&amp;observer don't (they receive a 503 error).
All groups seem to have the right to delete a task. Maybe we can change it to only the task creator and admin can delete a task?

It would be nice that in the group section of the admin panel, we can display some info about what privileges a group has.

Hi, I have the same issue with deleting a user.
I found a solution in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/687&gt;#687&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It isn't a problem. Such behavior is expected.

Are you sure? Only admin and task owner can delete a task (I've just checked it). I get code 403

New user has all groups now (admin, user, annotator, observer)

Checked it on both django and rest registrations. Can't reproduce.

I didn't see such code back then. I think the system was having some issues when I was experimenting so the privileges got messed up. It would be nice if each group's privileges are shown in the admin panel.
