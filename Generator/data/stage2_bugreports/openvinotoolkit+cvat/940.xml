	<summary>Loading PDF. RAM consumption.</summary>
	<description>
When I upload a large PDF file (for example a book with 300 pages), memory usage become incredible.
It takes all available RAM (about 16 gigabytes), starts to use swap and my system literally die.
Probably we should not store all pages in memory during extraction
