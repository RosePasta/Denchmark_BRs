	<summary>Incorrect order of labels in the exported masks</summary>
	<description>
Hi!
I'm trying to annotate images for a semantic segmentation task.
Once my images were uploaded, I made the polygonal labeling of the objects of interest using two classes.
However, when I go to "Dump annotatations&gt; Segmentation mask 1.1"
I get two folders: "SegmentationClass" and "SegmentationObject."
In the first folder I have the masks of only ONE class, while in the second folder I have the masks with all the objects noted, but with different colors.
I would like to have masks where annotated objects appear with a single color per class.
Example: [class1] = cat (red) [class2] = dog [yellow]
Like the semantic segmentation in this pic: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-21-at-10.44.23-PM.png&gt;https://www.jeremyjordan.me/content/images/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-21-at-10.44.23-PM.png&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

How can I do?
Thanks in advance

		Hello. The masks you're looking for should be in the SegmentationClass directory. Could you check if labelmap.txt contains all the classes the task has? Please, also specify your CVAT version.

		Thank you for the answer!
Yer the labelmap.txt contains all the classes that the task has:
# label:color_rgb:parts:actions Cat:48,112,32:: background:0,0,0:: Dog:176,112,32::
CVAT version:
Server version: 1.1b0
Core version: 3.1.1

Could you specify the commit hash (git log -1)?

Where can I find it?

		If you downloaded the project by cloning the repository, you need to type the command above. If you just downloaded a release or an archive from github - please tell the version.
