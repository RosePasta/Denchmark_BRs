&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;My actions before raising this issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 Read/searched the docs
 Searched past issues

I connected an MinIO Sever as a file share and when I try to create a task with a lot of images (~15k) the task spins for couple minutes then fails to be created with the following error messages.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69821298/94846235-6a8e3c80-03e6-11eb-9ae2-e9618918d2b1.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It seems to be complaining that there is a a subdirectory but I double checked and the directory I selected only contains jpgs.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create task without any issues. Even if there was a subdirectory I would expect it to search through it for more images and not fail.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

See image above. I have confirmed that other smaller directories work and similarly large directories fail.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Attach file share.
Try to import a large amount of data. 20k+ images.



&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Cannot create large tasks.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

, hi, it seems to me the problem was solved a few pull requests ago.
Could you please update your CVAT version and check if the problem is still there?
Also, could you please attach the logs? ()

 I've pulled the latest changes and no longer have this issue. The task was created just fine. Thanks!
