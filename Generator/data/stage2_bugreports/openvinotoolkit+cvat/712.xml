	<summary>CVAT 0.4.x: A user with the Observer role is able to add, edit, and dump annotations for a given task.</summary>
	<description>
Apologies if this has been fixed in latest CVAT release.

If so, please let me know.

Expectation:

A user with a role of "Observer" should be able to view a Task and maybe SEE the annotations.
But the user should not be able to edit, add, save, or dump annotations for a task.
Note that I am talking about the actual task view, where you can draw shapes and add labels.
Not the TF Annotation button on the dashboard, where all the tasks are listed.

Reality:

I create a task, T1, as User 1
I assign the task, T1, to User 1
I create User 2
Assign "Observer" role to User 2
User 2 sees the task T1(makes sense, he's an observer)
User 2 can go into task and edit annotations

Tested on

Ubuntu 18.04 through Docker
CVAT 0.4.0 version
