Hi, thanks for the report. It looks a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/issues/1030&gt;#1030&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We are going to fix it in the nearest future.

		At the moment as workaround is possible to set  to True here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/settings/base.py#L424&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/settings/base.py#L424&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to remove public access to unassigned tasks. The new permission system will be introduced in future releases.
