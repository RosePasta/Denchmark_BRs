Description: After CVAT install, going to &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080/&gt;http://localhost:8080/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in Chrome shows Bad Request Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand. Size of a request header field exceeds server limit.
Due to something completely unrelated I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 18.04 one week ago.  Everything else (hardware and software) I'm using works fine.  I reinstalled CVAT today following the instructions from
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

to the letter.
CVAT worked fine before my reinstall of Ubuntu, but now when I go to http://localhost:8080/ I get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Bad Request

Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.
Size of a request header field exceeds server limit.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I followed the above linked instructions the same before and after the Ubuntu reinstall.  This never happened before the reinstall.  I'm using Chrome.
My current concern seems similar to:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/issues/36&gt;#36&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But for some reason that is not clear to me that issue was closed, even though two people reported the same concern and there does not seem to have been a resolution, so I figured I'd repost as a new issue.
Per Issue 36 linked above, I did:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd ~/cvat
docker-compose down
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

changed supervisord.conf log level to DEBUG as Issue 36 instructs, then:
docker-compose up -d --build
After which I got the exact same error when going to http://localhost:8080/, the results of the docker-compose up -d --build command are attached.
If I do
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd ~/cvat
docker ps | grep cvat
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cdahms@TPX1G2:~/cvat$ docker ps | grep cvat

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Suggestions ??

		Thanks for the quick response.  1st thing this morning I ran:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd ~/cvat/
docker logs cvat &gt; 'docker logs cvat.txt'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the resulting docker logs cvat.txt is attached

		Very strange update.  If I use Firefox (still on same Ubuntu 18.04 install) it successfully gets to the login screen, and I can enter the Django username and pass I set during the CVAT install successfully.  But then the next screen says:
Your browser is detected as Firefox. This tool does not support it. Please use the latest version of Google Chrome.

Looks suspiciously:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[Fri Jan 03 17:42:53.881906 2020] [core:info] [pid 184:tid 140358356788992] [client 172.19.0.1:46642] AH00561: Request header exceeds LimitRequestFieldSize: Cookie
[Fri Jan 03 17:42:53.881908 2020] [core:debug] [pid 184:tid 140358356788992] protocol.c(1318): [client 172.19.0.1:46642] AH00567: request failed: error reading the headers
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It says one of your headers Cookie is too big.
Could you please send request details from the browser tab 'Network'?
UPD: Try to clear all cookies for this host. Maybe another service worked for you on the host port before and it used big cookies, I am not sure.

		Doing the following resolved the concern:
Open Chrome, go to:
dot dot dot button (at the top right) -&gt; History -&gt; History -&gt; Clear browsing data
set:
Time range =&gt; All time
(check) Browsing History
