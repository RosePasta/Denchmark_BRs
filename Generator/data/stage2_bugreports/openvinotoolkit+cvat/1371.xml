&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This looks like exacly the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/issues/1216&gt;#1216&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but with a different error message.   cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bsekachev&gt;@bsekachev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 because they implemented the last set of related fixes.

Hi, similar issue (moving between frames during resizing/dragging) has been fixed here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/1370&gt;#1370&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you please check if it helps you?

		I don't think so.
git checkout bs/batch_of_fixes
docker-compose build cvat_ui
docker-compose restart
I shift-reloaded the browser window to double-check.

I am able to reproduce issue you described without the fix above and unable to reproduce it with the fix. I haven't used rebuild, restart before and I am not sure whether they do the same what docker-compose up --build -d do.
Just in case try do git pull origin bs/batch_of_fixes before build and be sure you have the latest commit the same like in remote branch.

		docker-compose up --build -d
This apparently did something my other command did not.  Issue fixed for me.  Thanks for the quick response!
