		Hi, I experienced the same issue when deleting tasks from the Admin site. I understand that you will fix this in a coming release. However, how do I get rid of the data belonging to these tasks that have already been deleted via the Admin site? I have (successfully) deleted the data entries from engine_data and related tables, but the data is not deleted from the disk. Is this expected?
