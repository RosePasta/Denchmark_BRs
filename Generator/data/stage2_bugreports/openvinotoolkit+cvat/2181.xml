When I install pip dependencies, it successful and pip says:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.
We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.
astroid 2.4.2 requires lazy-object-proxy==1.4.*, but you'll have lazy-object-proxy 1.5.1 which is incompatible.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tried to use this flag and installation was failed with the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: Cannot install lazy-object-proxy==1.5.1 and -r cvat/requirements/development.txt (line 2) because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested lazy-object-proxy==1.5.1
    astroid 2.4.2 depends on lazy-object-proxy==1.4.*

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#fixing-conflicting-dependencies
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Probably need to fix it ASAP to escape possible future issues of our users.
