	<summary>Outside property not used for rectangle tracks at CVAT for Images 1.1</summary>

We use interpolation of rectangles to annotate objects in annotation mode. Occasionally a rectangle is not visible so we mark it as "outside". The dumped annotation xml using "CVAT for Images 1.1" still includes entries for the "outside" rectangles at the frames where they were marked as "outside" without any indication that they are actually outside. Using CVAT version v.1.1.0

 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/1729&gt;#1729&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The expected behaviour is to exclude entries for the rectangles that are marked as "outside" (as was the case with "hidden" at v.0.6.1).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As a test, we dumped the annotations using the "YOLO 1.1" format directly and the "outside" rectangles were excluded. Dumping with "CVAT for Videos 1.1" provides an "outside" attribute to the resulting xml however the output format of the xml is incompatible with the post-processing steps we developed using the previous CVAT version.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Create a new task
Draw new Rectangle as Track (doesn't matter if 2-points or 4-points)
Mark the rectangle at a random frame as "outside"
Save
Dump annotations as "CVAT for Images 1.1"

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I can't be sure if it a bug or desired behaviour introduced in the new version, however the usability of "hidden" from version 0.6.1 to hide object instances when annotating with interpolation mode cannot be reproduced neither with "hidden" nor with "outside".
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
