&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If a point is selected and mouse gets away from it, its size shall not change similar to the early versions.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When a point is select and mouse gets away from it, it becomes significantly bigger which hinders to see the area near that point.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Reverting back to the previous settings?!
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


start with creating a polygon.
create a point a release the mouse click. you see the points are becoming significantly bigger.
when you select another point and keep the left mouse click still pressed, the points appear with normal size, but as soon a you release the left click, they come larger.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It does not allow fine annotation because it blocks to see area near that point.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I used the "origin/develop" branch which has the commit dating until October 9th. 2020. I did not use any specific git tags as I wanted to clone the latest develop version.
I see the commit below as the latest commit by calling "git log"
commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/commit/2b221d26fd65cd4f7c81d19247459f3f2416ed73&gt;2b221d2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks. I see issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/2307&gt;#2307&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 dates back to 8 days ago. I will pull the merge and try again. I will update this issue afterwards.

I just pulled the repo by "git pull" and compiled it again
"docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml -f components/analytics/docker-compose.analytics.yml  up -d"
Still points appear to be bigger when selected and released.
Is there any way to define the point size when released?

		up -d doesn't rebuild image.
You need to use up --build -d

Oh I missed it. Now it is being built, but it takes long to finish.
In this way, even by a tiny modification in the code, the whole repo has to be built again.
I am wondering whether there is any alternatives to compile the code faster and see the changes.

Internally we use docker deployment only for production. For development &amp; debugging we install the whole system on a host operating system. The process is described in CONTRIBUTING.md

Thanks for the explanation.
I can confirm that the issue has been solved. I will then close the issue.
