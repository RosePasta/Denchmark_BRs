	<summary>"Annotation has failed" for auto_annotation</summary>
	<description>
My openvino model is imported and working properly for small dataset. However, when I select a large image dataset i.e.  than &gt; 500 images, Annotation completed 100% but at the end I get this error" Annotation has failed". I tried to use segment size = 200 and overlap to compress data... but it did not help.
