	<summary>ZeroDivisionError when attempting to download annotations</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;My actions before raising this issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I searched both existing issues and gitter for this error and couldn't find a reference
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

XML that causes this issue attached.
I am running into an issue with the TASK endpoint where annotations that have loaded successfully raise an error when I attempt to download them. The created task has a segment size of 1500 frames and 5 frames of overlap. This generates 2 jobs against which the attached annotation xml file is loaded.
Without making any changes to the annotations, attempting to download them, throws the following error:
