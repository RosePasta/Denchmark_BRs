	<summary>Error when creating superuser in fresh install</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;My actions before raising this issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 Read/searched the docs
 Searched past issues

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After building the docker I expect to be able to create a super user with the following command from the installation guide:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; docker exec -it cvat bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Instead I get the following error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;You have 54 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): account, admin, auth, authtoken, contenttypes, engine, git, sessions, sites, socialaccount.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py", line 84, in _execute
    return self.cursor.execute(sql, params)

                                                             ^


The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Perhaps something with a database?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


git clone https://github.com/opencv/cvat.git
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it cvat bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried this on a pc which had an older version of CVAT running without problems. I also tried it on another pc which did not have a previous install of CVAT to be sure.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Git hash commit (git log -1):

Docker version docker version (e.g. Docker 17.0.05):

Are you using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes?
I don't know, for sure not kubernetes.
Operating System and version (e.g. Linux, Windows, MacOS):

		How long is the cvat container up? I see only ~7 sec time difference between the first and last event and cannot obtain any messages about applied migrations and so on. Please note that cvat cannot start instantly and this process takes some time. It's depend on the machine (disk performance, cpu, etc), especially it's relevant for fresh installation.
Please start container with docker-compose up -d command
Wait about 1min and make sure that you see message like this in the docker logs cvat
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-06-23 16:35:04,590 DEBG 'runserver' stdout output:

After that should be possible to create a new superuser.

		Ah thank you, that might be the issue since I do not wait when starting up. I will test this and report back.

		<comment id='5' author='MuadDev' date='2020-06-24T14:40:16Z'>
		Ok, so these are the steps I tried:

Started the docker and waited for 15 min
docker-compose up -d
Looked at the logs
docker logs cvat
This resulted in similar output as was shown above. Therefore I tried starting from scratch.

Starting from scratch

Shutdown and remove containers
docker-compose down -v
Rebuild without cache
docker-compose build --no-cache
Start
docker-compose up -d
Waited several hours, but the result is the same...

For some context. This happens on a quite powerful machine. The storage is a SSD drive, the CPU is a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6800K CPU @ 3.40GHz, and it also has 2 GPUs but that is probably not relevant. What I am trying to say, I would expect that this machine would not take so long for starting up as it is quite powerful.

 ok, startup process usually takes no more than 1 min. Could you save your log as file and attach it here?

		In the original error message i posted it gave a hint about a migration that needed to be done, see my first post in this thread. I just carried that out:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker exec -it cvat bash -ic '/usr/bin/python3 ~/manage.py migrate'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This gave the following output
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29200372/85727291-2dcfec80-b6f7-11ea-8fe8-6e39e3c15d34.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29200372/85727385-404a2600-b6f7-11ea-9583-6224b304b182.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After that I was at least able to create the superuser and get to the webpage using chrome. However, I cannot use this user to login. This is the error shown:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29200372/85727760-91f2b080-b6f7-11ea-951d-df57b674073d.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

So for me it is unclear if my original error is now solved or that it this is just the next step in the same error?

		You original issue doesn't related with unapplied migrations, for some reason the backend server is not started properly. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this issue. Could you do the following steps:

docker-compose up -d
wait 1-3 min
docker exec -it cvat bash
open  top utility and make a screenshot.

		Hello.  I just wanted to say that I'm getting this same issue.  I've tried both the release-1.1.0 branch, and develop, and I get django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation "auth_user" does not exist as well when I try to run docker exec -it cvat bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'.

I just start the server with 'docker-compose up'.  I don't bother with the -d, but I doubt that has anything to do with anything.  I haven't edited the code-base at all, but I didn't copy-paste the install steps either because I didn't want to use all of these 3rd party repos that I don't necessarily trust.  I'm using docker-ce from a previous project.  Just wondering if this helps at all.  I know it's super hard to troubleshoot issues you can't reproduce yet.

After that, I could create the user too, but also not use it yet to log-in because of the same gateway error.

I do suspect these are layerd problems and the migration thing is a solution to the first one.  There's some additional discussion about the original problem here:

		As far as reproducing goes:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/azhavoro&gt;@azhavoro&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 : Did you try removing your docker volumes and removing the cvat docker containers before doing a "docker-compose up"?  That reproduces it for me every time on the release-1.1.0 branch.

		Ah HA!!! :-D  I finally figured out why this happens for some people and not for others.  It took me days, but I was able to do a binary search on the difference between my machine (where the installation instructions did NOT work) and a machine in the cloud (where the exact same install script worked).  After starting with entire filesystems as potential differences, I eventually got it down to a single line in my .bashrc file.  The line is this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;umask 077
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, it seems, that the ability to run and use cvat (even if I got past the superuser issue with the migration, the server would never actually work when this umask line was in place), depends on the user's umask!!!
This greatly simplifies the problem now, hopefully the point that someone can submit a patch for it.  I don't know enough about the cvat system to determine why the umask is breaking the install process .  I suspect it has something to do with permissions in the git clone but I haven't verified that yet.  Can someone from the cvat team replicate this and maybe adjust the installation instructions to set any permissions as needed after the clone, or better yet, fix whatever permissions thing is happening?  I think 077 should be a valid umask for people to work under.
If it helps, here's my install script - it's the same as your instructions, but in one place so it might be helpful for you.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;set -xe 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# start instructions from cvat

sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y \
  apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg-agent \
  software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository \
  "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) \
  stable"
  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y python3-pip

sudo apt-get install -y python3-setuptools
sudo python3 -m pip install docker-compose compose
sudo chown -R "$USER":"$USER" /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages


sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/cvat
cd cvat
git checkout 820f2c5724a50650f7325508152c3ee166ffe245

#docker-compose build

sudo su -ml "$USER" &lt;&lt;EOF
# TODO: Try to remove the -d
docker-compose up -d
EOF

echo 'sleeping 1m to make sure the server is up.'
sleep 60

# #Exit and re-log in and then do this.  If it errors, then you have the issue.  If it runs fine, then you don't.
# docker exec -it cvat bash -ic 'python3 ~/manage.py createsuperuser'

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Update:  A sudo chmod -R o+rX . after the git clone ... and cd cvat makes it work even if I have umask 077 as my usermask.  Seems to be a permissions thing on something in the repo.  I recommend finding what that thing is and maybe changing permissions in the docker container.  IMHO, people should be able to have restrictive permissions in their home dir.
