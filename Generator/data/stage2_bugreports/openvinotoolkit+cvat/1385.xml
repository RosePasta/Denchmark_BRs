&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When retrieving annotation information for COCO, I would expect that the image name contains the folder as well.  For example if I upload a set of images in a folder for "Task 1" with subfolders "Job1" ... "Jobn" each containing images to be marked that the json would return a path with the folder.  Such as "file_name": img1.jpg "path": path/to/folder/containing/img1 or "file_path": path/to/folder/img1.jpg.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Currently the json returns simply a filename.  So in the event that I have subfolders with conflicting filenames, it requires the end user to determine which folder it came from using some type of logic.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As mentioned above, include some kind of item in the json that allows you to see the path of the image file.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We've had to use other annotation formats and convert them to COCO ourselves.
