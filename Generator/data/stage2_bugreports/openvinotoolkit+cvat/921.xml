	<summary>Display names of selected files when creating a new task</summary>
	<description>
When creating a task, files downloaded from a my computer are displayed simply as the number selected files.
It would be more convenient to see names of selected files added using area “Click or drag files to this area”.

For example, this area after downloading at least one file may change to a list of files.
