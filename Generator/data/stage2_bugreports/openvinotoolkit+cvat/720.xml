	<summary>Uploading of annotations results in all frames being keyframes</summary>
	<description>
Annotations dumped in CVAT XML 1.1 for videos and uploaded for a similar task. However after uploading all frames are keyframes even though XML has information on which frames should be keyframes.
This makes it tedious to make changes to a track as each frame has to be edited

 , need to investigate. If both tasks are in interpolation mode and dumped annotations for videos it is a bug.
