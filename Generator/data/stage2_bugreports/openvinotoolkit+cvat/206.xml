	<summary>Adding label with quotation is successful but does not allow any labels after</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I can successfully add the following label and it is also showing in the UI:
label ~radio=labelattributes:"yes","missing","can't tell"
However, adding any subsequent label via 'Update Task' results in the following error:

Task update error. No closing quotation

I am using cvat github version from 2018-11-19.
