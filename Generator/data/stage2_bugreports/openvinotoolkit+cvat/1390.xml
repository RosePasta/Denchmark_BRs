	<summary>Z-axis-slider in a task with z-order disabled (in new UI)</summary>
	<description>
If the z-order is disabled in the created task, the z-axis-slider is still active or can be made active by clicking on the add new layer button, the order will also switch to the "+" and "-" buttons and the buttons in the action "to background" and "to foreground" is also active.
But the order of objects does not affect the annotation file. This is confusing.
Maybe if z-order is disabled when creating a task, make all the elements related to z-order inactive?

		I suppose we should deprecate z order flag during task creating in the future releases

		I believe the issue was resolved. Now you cannot specify z-order when create an annotation task.
