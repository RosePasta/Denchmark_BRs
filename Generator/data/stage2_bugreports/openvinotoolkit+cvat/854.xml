	<summary>Cliend side merge function has a performance bottleneck</summary>
	<description>
It can take a lot of time to compute and can be easy optimized
Reason is computing of min &amp; max zOrder values for each keyframe in every merged track.
It triggers interpolation of all shapes on all frames.
