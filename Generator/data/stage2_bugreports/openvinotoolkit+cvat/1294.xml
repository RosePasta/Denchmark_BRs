	<summary>Exporting Frame-stepped project in YOLO Format</summary>
	<description>
I have a video project which has been annotated using a frame step of 5. Upon export in the YOLO format, the annotations are wrong. All ###.jpg files have ###.txt files that are completely empty. In addition, many "frame_#####.txt" files are also generated within the export data folder and while they do have annotation data, they do not correctly correspond to the same ###.jpg files.
