	<summary>cvat_ui is loading infinetly</summary>
	<description>
After successful docker-compose build and up, cvat_ui is not responding correctly. Interface is loading infinetly, as shown below:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4639077/64874797-6fa21180-d654-11e9-9def-89413f025148.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried to setup from master (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/commit/c05c7aea8b548d71f9b5cce62370160051535237&gt;c05c7ae&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
Can you help me to solve the issue. Any additional information I will attach at monday. Please specify what is necessary for you.
I made the following changes in docker-compose.yml for our case:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;diff --git a/docker-compose.yml b/docker-compose.yml

It's a pre-alpha functionality. We don't recommend use it till the next release.
Previous UI version is expected to be work.

Could you clarify how to use previous UI version or just use repo from Release 0.5.0 ?

Go to default port: 8080, not 9080

There is error Bad Request (400) on 8080 port.

		Issue resolved ?
I just changed servername and then ui on 8080 is opens normally.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR django.security.DisallowedHost: Invalid HTTP_HOST header
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Great.
Nevertheless we should investigate about new ui.
Let's leave the issue open.

Why is in official manual there is installing from master ?
https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md#additional-components
Is it would be better to checkout release tag/branch before run docker-compose then it would be logical to indicate this in installation manual

 , new CVAT UI was reimplemented. I will close the issue because it isn't actual anymore. Don't hesitate to reopen it if you still can reproduce the issue on develop branch.
