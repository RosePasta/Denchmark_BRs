	<summary>Import error when adding additional labels</summary>
	<description>
I have the following issue. I have an existing task with labels A and B. Now, I want to add labels C and D that appear in a file with annotations. After adding the labels in the task interface, uploading the annotations produces the following error:
TypeError: Cannot read property 'attributes' of undefined
If I instead create a new task with labels C and D, the import works fine.

I am unable to reproduce the issue.
Steps I tried:

Created a task with two labels
Created four objects there
Dumped annotations as CVAT Images
Changed labels in the dumped annotation file for two objects (doesn't exist in the task)
Added these labels on the task page
Uploaded annotations successfully

Please, update your CVAT and the issue probably will go away.
I will close the issue for now, if you still experience it, please reopen
