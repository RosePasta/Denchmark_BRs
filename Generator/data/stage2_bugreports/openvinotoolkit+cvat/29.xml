	<summary>Where does the shared server directory point at?</summary>
	<description>
To create huge tasks the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/master/cvat/apps/documentation/user_guide.md&gt;documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggests choosing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/master/cvat/apps/documentation/static/documentation/images/image005.jpg&gt;Share&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 option in the dialog box.
While trying to select the files I see a modal popping up with the following path as title:

However I can not navigate from there (nor I can find where this path is). The documentation also does not elaborate much for large number of frames. Any advice?

		Hi, thanks for you question.
We have fixed already this problem. It will be merged at near time.
Currently, if you want create task bigger, you can change LOCAL_LOAD_MAX_FILES_COUNT and LOCAL_LOAD_MAX_FILES_SIZE variables in the cvat/settings/base.py. They define max number of files and max files size for data uploading via client.
