	<summary>Uploading large XML Files</summary>
	<description>
I am having issues uploading large XML files. I created a task with 130K images. I uploaded the annotations XML file around 120MB. It says file being processed. Once it says annotations are being saved, it fails. Changed the DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE value to 300 MB from the default 100MB but still no luck.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rnekk2&gt;@rnekk2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Could you please archive your XML file and attach to the issue (or share with us somehow)? We will try to reproduce the problem locally and improve upload functionality somehow.

		This fix works for annotation files which contain large number of shapes.
However there is other case when annotation file contains some tracks each of them is defined for wide range of frames. So, annotation have a short of time to save and we get 504 code again.

		We completely reimplemented upload annotation method. It should work with huge annotation files.
