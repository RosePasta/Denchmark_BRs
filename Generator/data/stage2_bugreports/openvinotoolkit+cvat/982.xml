	<summary>Incompatible CUDA version with tensorflow-gpu 1.15</summary>
	<description>
As in tensor flow gpu support page, cuda-10.0 is required to run the tensorflow-gpu 1.15 . But inside the cvat/components/cuda/install.sh you're still using the cuda9.0
CUDA_VERSION=9.0.176
NCCL_VERSION=2.1.15
CUDNN_VERSION=7.6.2.24
CUDA_PKG_VERSION="9-0=${CUDA_VERSION}-1"

		The PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/968&gt;#968&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the root cause of the issue.
