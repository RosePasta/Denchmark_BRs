	<summary>Annotation file should contain original file names (extension can be wrong)</summary>
	<description>
I have an annotation task which was created for 10 ".png" images. Inside annotation file all files have ".jpg" extension. It isn't correct and leads to problems when you try to use scripts to convert data into COCO format.
