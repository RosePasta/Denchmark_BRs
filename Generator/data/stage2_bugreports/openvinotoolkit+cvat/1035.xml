	<summary>Error: Network Error after PC Restart</summary>
	<description>
CVAT was working fine. But after restarting my PC, I'm getting an error:

Could not check authorization on the server
Error: Network Error.

So I tried to run it again using:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker-compose -y &lt;yml file1&gt; -y &lt;yml file2&gt;.... down
docker-compose -y &lt;yml file1&gt; -y &lt;yml file2&gt;.... up -d --build
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and its working again.
But after restarting my PC, I'm getting the same error.

 , probably it is really necessary to fix. The primary problem here is simple: inside  container we have temporary apache files. The first  command deletes these temporary files and apache can start again normally. It is a well-known problem with apache in a docker container: &lt;denchmark-link:https://forums.docker.com/t/httpd-already-running/33397&gt;https://forums.docker.com/t/httpd-already-running/33397&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It seems it is necessary to remove apache2.pid file explicitly every time.

		Okay, thanks for giving the actual reason for the bug.
So, do I have to do that manually every time? By running this down and up command every time I start my PC.
(Also, a startup script can do this for me).
Or is there a permanent bug fix possible?

 , it is possible to fix. Just need to remove the file explicitly: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/bdfd0fc1d19102cd6f951614072a51eabf7191bf/5.6/apache/apache2-foreground&gt;https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/bdfd0fc1d19102cd6f951614072a51eabf7191bf/5.6/apache/apache2-foreground&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I cross-checked the existence of this apache2.pid file from the container bash (after restarting my pc again), but the folder is empty.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker exec -it cvat bash
cd /var/run/apache2/
ls
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This shows empty directory

		Same issues, same situation on /var/run/apache2/. Is empty. Any other idea?

		pid file (httpd.pid) located here /tmp/mod_wsgi-localhost:8080:1000/. Directory name is generated by mod_wsgi during start up I guess.
According mod_wsgi documentation it should be possible specify pid file location
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;--pid-file FILE-PATH  Specify an alternate file to be used to store the
                        process ID for the root process of the web server.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nmanovic&gt;@nmanovic&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is this issue fixed in the new release?
I am facing this error today. Over the past few days, it was working properly. I am running CVAT on Windows Enterprise. I am attaching the error that I am getting here.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22560434/76821972-9a546900-6835-11ea-9594-48b50ea0b843.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 How can fetch the logs? Is it saved in some location after it's built or should I copy from the docker app on Windows?
