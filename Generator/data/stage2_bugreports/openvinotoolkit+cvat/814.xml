	<summary>Wrong Annotation Per Category using COCO Json</summary>
	<description>
Hello
I finish to annotate a tiny dataset.
This dataset has 4 classes.
I dump the annotations as a MS-COCO json format.
Using pycocotools I ask to access the annotations related to 1 of the 4 classes.
What I got does not correspond to what I ask, In the annotations returned I got annotations that does cover other annotations as well as the one I asked.
I used pycocotools before with different dataset without issues.
----Edit----
I pushed further my investigations... the whole convertion is wrong.
I labeled 200 images only, the number of images id is right but the only image that as been converted is the first one and that for each classe.

 , sorry for the bad experience. Please let's look at the issue and come back with a fix. Could use please provide steps to reproduce the bug? Thus it will be easy for us to fix it in short period of time.

		Actually I just labels my dataset, dump the data as MS-COCO JSON.
Then I wanted to save the mask from the annotations in a folder in order to evaluate if I miss labeled an image.
My first step was to check if the labels names was correct.
There was.
I check that le number of image_ids fit with the number of images I labeled.
Then I wrote the folowing python script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;for cat in  tmp:
    print(len(tmp[cat]))
    anns = tmp[cat]
    for i in range(len(tmp[cat])):
        mask = coco.annToMask(anns[i]) * 255
        output_filename = os.path.join('/home/smile/prog/tiny_labeling_cows/a65/masks', cat,'{}.png'.format(i) )
        cv2.imwrite(output_filename, mask)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

coco in this script is an pycocotools.coco.COCO object.
I can provide you the generated json, and cvat xml files if you want to compare.
The cvat xml file seems to be accurate.

  Hi, when I dump the annotations as a MS-COCO json format, I also have some problems.
I try to do some key annotation on my dataset,  the annotations as a MS-COCO json format are as follows:
{
"licenses": [

"name": "",
"id": 0,
"url": ""
}
],

}
],
"annotations": []
}
Nothing in "annotations":[]. And the annotations as a CVAT XML for IMAGES is normal, just as follows:

In this annotations, I can get the coordinates of the marked points.

 Hi, it's expected. For now CVAT supports export of polygons and rectangles only for COCO (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/README.md#ms-coco-object-detection&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/README.md#ms-coco-object-detection&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 If you have to use COCO format you can extend existing dump functionality (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) to handle your case properly. It would be great if you contribute this feature to CVAT.

 FYI the annotations for class named  must overlap (or almost_overlap in some images) with the classes  and .
If i may help I can also provide you the images

 Hi, I tried to add the human key annotation function for cvat. Now I have basically achieved this function by modifying the file (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/utils/coco/converter.py&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/utils/coco/converter.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
),
I want to add this part of modification to source (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). But I don't know where to call the (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) code file (in fact, I don't know how to define the "file" object, annotations "in line 61 of (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Hi, dumper code is called from here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/3b6961f4db95894229f466cd9b897c5ef3f8db9b/cvat/apps/engine/annotation.py#L722&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/3b6961f4db95894229f466cd9b897c5ef3f8db9b/cvat/apps/engine/annotation.py#L722&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I suggest you make a copy of dumper function and call it from mentioned function directly for debugging, because it's difficult to debug python exec call.

 I'm not sure that understand you question correctly, but  is  defined in the 731th line &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/3b6961f4db95894229f466cd9b897c5ef3f8db9b/cvat/apps/engine/annotation.py#L731&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/3b6961f4db95894229f466cd9b897c5ef3f8db9b/cvat/apps/engine/annotation.py#L731&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I try to explain my previous answer. You code should be smth like that:
# define new function
def coco_dumper_copy(file_object, annotations):
  # copy the dumper code from https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/annotation/coco.py
  # Note also you need copy mask_to_polygon function as well


def dump(self, filename, dumper, scheme, host): 
    # you need to change only the last line:
#   execute_python_code("{}(file_object, annotations)".format(dumper.handler), global_vars)
    coco_dumper_debug(dump_file, anno_exporter)

  So I should  "with open(filename, 'wb') as dump_file:" to get dump_file. But I don't know what kind of file filename here refers to. Can you provide me a sample file in filename formatï¼Ÿ Thank you

 Maybe it will be helpful:
Please read the corresponding section of contributing guide  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-environment&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-environment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After that you can run CVAT without Docker and easily debug backend python code via Visual Studio Code.

 Have you found why the convertion from CVAT xml to MS-COCO json does not compute more than the first annotated image ?

 Hi, apologies for the delayed response. What version of CVAT did you use? I tested on the current develop branch: I created the task, upload *.xml provided provided by you and dumped annotation as COCO json. It's completely different from your *.json file. Also I tried to upload the generated json and it seems to look ok. Could you please try the latest develop branch?

 I think you confused my name with the one of someone else.
I take a look of the version that I have here I did not find any reference of any version.
How can I know which version I am using ?

 Yep, sorry about that. If you cloned CVAT via git it's possible obtain exact commit that you use by  command. However if you downloaded CVAT as zip you can open link . In any case please update to the latest version and try to reproduce the bug, because I cannot reproduce it on my side.

		I took a look when the folder for the version of CVAT I used was created.
I remembered that this folder was created only for this version and never updated.
It was created in august.
I did a git pull to updated, and I rebuild CVAT after.
Do you think it is enough to fix that issue ?

 On my side the latest develop branch works as expected. Since August there have been several fixes to the coco dumper/loader, just try to update. If the update does not solve the issue, let's investigate it further.

		Hello
I made the trial I am talking about in my last post.
I observed that when I dump the annotation as MS-COCO JSON the annotations fit with the image.
The issue I reported in here does not exist anylonger.
I observed another error but minor, I labeled for this trial a set of 200 images but only have 199 image ids in the MS-COCO JSON.
However this is another error.
Thank you very much for your help.
