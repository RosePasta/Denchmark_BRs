	<summary>CVAT new UI: Filter property "shape" and operator "~="</summary>
	<description>
In the new UI, itâ€™s not clear how to use a filter with the "shape" property,
I tried the filter "shape == polygon" and the like, but they just hide all the objects.
And also I did not understand in what cases to use the operator "~ =", for example, applying the filter "width ~ = 100" causes an error:

There were two issues with this operator. First right operator is , not 
Second is that operator allows to use regular expressions (according to specification), but technically a library that we use doesn't support this operator.
So, I've just removed it from CVAT.
