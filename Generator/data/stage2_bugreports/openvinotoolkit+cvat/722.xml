Could you send us this file for investigating?

I suppose your case isn't related with image size. Just the whole request body is too large.
Try to use share to create a task with this set of files.

Also, I suppose it would be better to handle case of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cvadim4two&gt;@cvadim4two&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. At least by showing better message.
Something like: "Too much data to upload thought a browser. Try to create this task via a shared file storage"

@cvadim4two

Can you suggest: where is request body size should be increased in cvat (deployed with docker-compose) ?

 , if you can share with us some files (generated or original) to reproduce the issue it will be easy for us to fix.

 A manager do not have time now for search those images. We will do it later. Please wait.

Just two comments:

Remote input dialog expects direct links to files (these links must have extenstions .jpg, .png, etc.)
Share functionality works well, but it seems to be, one of images which you send to CVAT is broken and CVAT cannot process it.
