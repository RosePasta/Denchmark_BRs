	<summary>cannot login from LAN and WAN at the same time</summary>
	<description>
I notice in some previous issue , some method has been provide to make the system could be login from LAN &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/issues/1093&gt;#1093&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  or WAN &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/issues/1095&gt;#1095&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  . But I found that if I set the system login from WAN for my peers, I could not even login from LAN for task managent . Can any one provide an solution ?
