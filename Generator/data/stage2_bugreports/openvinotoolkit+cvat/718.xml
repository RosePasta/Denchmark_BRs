	<summary>mask problem on coco json style</summary>
	<description>
The overlap part between two masks would disappear,  and the area would only be covered by one of these masks. and another one, would be separated into two parts by the overlap area.

For example, I draw shapes like this.

when I download and upload it as cvat xml, it is normal.
But, when I download and upload it in coco xml format, it changes, the overlap part is disapear.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20524338/64950040-17b21780-d8ad-11e9-9391-d53ed9f8544e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For another example, it even create a new shape itself.

 , I see the problem. Need to check if it is correct behaviours or not. We will investigate.

		I am getting this same issue, even if I export as CVAT XML and convert to COCO JSON using the coco converter in the CVAT utils. Instances can be separated, but if there is overlap, only one instance mask will include those pixels.
