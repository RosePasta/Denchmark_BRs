	<summary>'404 Not Found' error when running docker Analytics</summary>
	<description>
To create the issue:
1- Install CVAT
2- Add docker-compose.override.yml file to add server info and shared path link
3- Run 'docker-compose up -d' to run CVAT on server
4- Run 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/analytics/docker-compose.analytics.yml build' to build docker image
4- Run 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/analytics/docker-compose.analytics.yml up -d' to run docker container
Server version is 0.6.1
Core, Canvas, UI versions 0.5.2
If we run steps 1 to 3, CVAT works fine on the server.
If we skip step 2, CVAT works fine on the local host and Analytics tap works fine as well.
But when we try to have Analytics on server, we see the issue.

 Hi,
When you specify config file(s) with  you should include  file to the 4'th and 5'th commands as well, because docker-compose doesn't read the override file in this case:


I'll close the issue, feel free to re-open if this issue is still actual for you.
