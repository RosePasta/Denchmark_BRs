	<summary>CVAT behave unstable with wrong uploaded auto annotation models</summary>
	<description>
If a user had been able to upload a wrong model, or a script, or something else, dashboard can't be downloaded anymore because of wrong meta information request.
Several users have already come across this problem.
WORKAROUND:
Delete a broken model manually from the CVAT database:
docker exec -it cvat_db bash
su postgres     # change a user to postgres (default you are root, so password isn't needed)
psql cvat     # connect to cvat database
\dt     # show all tables
select * from auto_annotation_autoannotationmodel; 
delete * from auto_annotation_autoannotationmodel where id=&lt;id_of_broken_model&gt;;

		Bug already fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/pull/573&gt;#573&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Also models can be deleted via admin panel without direct query to the database.
