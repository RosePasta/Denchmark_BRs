	<description>
Navigation by frames may will work incorrect in next scenario:

Open any task in CVAT
Resize browser to size which is less then CVAT workspace
Scroll browser slider right
Try to navigate with player progress bar

Player will not react to the progress bar navigation if cursor near start of the progress bar. Such "non react" area will increase if you scroll the browser slider more to the right
