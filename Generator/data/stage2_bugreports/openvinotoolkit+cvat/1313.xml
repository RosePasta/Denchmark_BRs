	<summary>annotation upload corrupt for overlapping segments</summary>
	<description>
i've noticed that if one has a video in CVAT which is segmented into several jobs and then uploads an annotation (containing annotations for one segment) the annotation cannot be changed and saved or deleted and saved if the annotation is bigger than the specific segment range. also the same is if there is an overlap between segments.
an example:
job 1: from 0 to 200
job 2: from 195 to 395
job 3: from 390 to 590
so if the annotation has data for frames 195 to 395, the problem described above occurs.
also there will be a problem if one uploads an annotation for frames in the range 201 to 396.
im only able to edit and save the uploaded annotation if it is in the range of 201 to 395.

		i think this issue doesnt happen for every kind of annotation.
i used a single point with interpolation. fyi.
what is also interesting to explore is that i see the annotation appearing in job 1 if the object appears mostly in job 2 but overlaps with job 1 a bit. however, the interesting part is that the object in job 1 is reverted in its movement, basically it is the mirror of the movement of the object in job 2. this cannot be right.
