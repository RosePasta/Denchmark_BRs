CVAT works well in Google Chrome (where it is tested mainly). It also works in Firefox, but our users often uses Safari to work with CVAT, where the tool doesn't work correctly because of some Safari restrictions.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Except of trying to fix Safari issues with a workaround we might add a warning message with recommendations to use another browser
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
