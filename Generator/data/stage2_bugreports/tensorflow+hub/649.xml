	<summary>Training bert on 1 machine with 8 v100s throws `Trying to access a placeholder that is not supposed to be executed`</summary>
	<description>
Load the hub under a mirrored strategy and training a classification algorithm. This model is trained on 8 v100 gpus in google cloud by submitting a docker container to google cloud machine learning engine.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;... 
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model = MyModel() # uses hub.KerasLayer layer to load bert multi lingual 
    model.fit(..)             # explodes 

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Relevant part of the trace, in which you can see it is a node under the bert embeddings

		After looking further at the stack trace this looks like it was not coming from .fit but predict / eval being ran under the context manager.

 Yes this does look like a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/issues/515&gt;#515&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Lets close this issue and track it in issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/issues/515&gt;#515&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Let me know if you think otherwise. Thanks!
