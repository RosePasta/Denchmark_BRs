	<summary>Vggish Feature Extraction Model</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to use "vggish" for feature extraction of my work. I used "vggish_inference_demo.py" for feature extraction. Input to the code was mono audio with sample rate 16KHz. Few audio giving output embedding vectors of shape of (1, 128) whereas few giving (0,128). I am unable to identify why few audio are not giving any vectors.
Help will be appreciated.

! As far as I can see, the concern is really about tensorflow/models and not tensorflow/hub, so let me close this here.
