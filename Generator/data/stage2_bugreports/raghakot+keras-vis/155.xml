 Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of keras-vis. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/raghakot/keras-vis.git --upgrade --no-deps


 If running on TensorFlow, check that you are up-to-date with the latest version. The installation instructions can be found here.


 Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).


This will throw an error



keras-vis/vis/callbacks.py

 def callback(self, i, named_losses, overall_loss, grads, wrt_value): 



 img = utils.deprocess_input(wrt_value[0]) 



 img = utils.draw_text(img, "Step {}".format(i + 1)) 



 self.writer.append_data(img) 





because deprocess_input's output must be converted to be used in gif
A fix would be:
         img = utils.deprocess_input(wrt_value[0]).astype('uint8')
Demo Generating animated gif of optimization progress from Documentation will currently not work.
