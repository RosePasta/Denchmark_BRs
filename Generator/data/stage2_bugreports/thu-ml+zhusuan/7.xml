	<summary>prettytensor's unimplemented he_init() for conv2d causes forward propagation exploding</summary>
	<description>
Current solution: When using conv2d, apply a patch to
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;.../python2.7/dist-packages/prettytensor/pretty_tensor_image_methods.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

# init = layers.he_init(size[2] * patch_size, size[3] * patch_size,
#                                activation_fn)
init = layers.xavier_init(size[2] * patch_size, size[3] * patch_size)
This issue will be solved in future after we have our own neural layers and get rid of prettytensor.

		Fixed for new examples in master because we use Tensorflow contrib layers now.
