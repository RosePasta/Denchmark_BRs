	<summary>Large-DCUNet-20 decoder misconfiguration</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The configuration provided in _dcunet_architectures.py for Large-DCUNet-20 will lead to an error when decoding.
The decoder isn't set to auto not sure why.
Anyway, I think (need to be checked) the right configuration is
       # Decoders:
        # (in_chan, out_chan, kernel_size, stride, padding, output_padding)
        (
            (128, 90, (5, 3), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (7, 5), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 45, (7, 5), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (90, 45, (1, 7), (1, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            ( 90,  1, (7, 1), (1, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),

		Yeah I realised that as well, there is a typo in the last line. The correct decoders list is
            (128, 90, (5, 3), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (5, 3), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (7, 5), (2, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (180, 90, (7, 5), (2, 2), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (135, 90, (1, 7), (1, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),
            (135,  1, (7, 1), (1, 1), "auto", (0, 0)),

Maybe "auto" actually does the right thing and for some reason I thought it doesn't?

		Ok I missed this figure. Actually "auto" does what I suggested so no we should definitely fix with your config
