	<summary>Wrong sample rate on Wham-ConvTasNet recipe when training a 16000 Hz model</summary>
	<description>
I detected a bug in Wham/ConvTasNet recipe, located in the file train.py :
when training a model with a sample rate of 16000 Hz then the model (best_model.pth file) generated (by run.sh)  is registered with a sample rate of 8000 Hz instead of 16000 Hz,
it's because the sample rate value is not passed when ConvTasNet class is instancied at line 60 of train.py file :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = ConvTasNet(**conf["filterbank"], **conf["masknet"])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

a solution is to add the sample rate value (in order to avoid the default value 8000 Hz) :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; model = ConvTasNet(**conf["filterbank"], **conf["masknet"], sample_rate=conf["data"]["sample_rate"])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid/blob/master/egs/wham/ConvTasNet/train.py&gt;https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid/blob/master/egs/wham/ConvTasNet/train.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
