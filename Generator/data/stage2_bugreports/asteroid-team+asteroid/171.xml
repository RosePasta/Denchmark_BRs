	<summary>Error in Training ConvTasNet on LibriMix</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After having created all mixtures and moving onto stage 1 of run.sh, the following errors show up -
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Stage 1: Training
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "train.py", line 127, in &lt;module&gt;
{'data': {'n_src': 3,

  File "/home/subhanjan/asteroid/asteroid/data/librimix_dataset.py", line 52, in __init__
    md_file = [f for f in os.listdir(csv_dir) if 'both' in f][0]
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/wav8k/min/train-360'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have been trying to train ConvTasNet on n_src=3 for a while now and since LibriMix has this feature conveniently built in, I have been trying to use that, but I have been running into errors with the train_dir, test_dir variables in run.sh. Do they need to be changed? They're being parsed as .csv files so what should these paths be changed to.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is what my run.sh looks like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;storage_dir=../LibriMix3spk

# After running the recipe a first time, you can run it from stage 3 directly to train new models.

# Path to the python you'll use for the experiment. Defaults to the current python
# You can run ./utils/prepare_python_env.sh to create a suitable python environment, paste the output here.
python_path=python

# Example usage
# ./run.sh --stage 3 --tag my_tag --task sep_noisy --id 0,1

# General
stage=0  # Controls from which stage to start
tag=""  # Controls the directory name associated to the experiment
# You can ask for several GPUs using id (passed to CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES)
id=0
out_dir=librimix # Controls the directory name associated to the evaluation results inside the experiment directory

# Network config
n_blocks=8
n_repeats=3
mask_act=relu
# Training config
epochs=200
batch_size=24
num_workers=4
half_lr=yes
early_stop=yes
# Optim config
optimizer=adam
lr=0.001
weight_decay=0.
# Data config
train_dir=data/wav8k/min/train-360
valid_dir=data/wav8k/min/dev
test_dir=data/wav8k/min/test
sample_rate=16000
n_src=3
segment=3
task=sep_noisy  # one of 'enh_single', 'enh_both', 'sep_clean', 'sep_noisy'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Kindly consider making run.sh more user-friendly and modular, since it's the user's only way of interacting with the program.

		I have tried changing data/wav8k/min/train-360 to ~/asteroid/egs/librimix/ConvTasNet/LibriMix3spk/Libri3Mix/wav8k/min/train-360/ (which is where prepare_data.sh has created and saved the mixtures). However, like I said, $test_dir is supposed to be parsed as a .csv so I am running into more errors. I can attach the stack trace, if required

 could you look into that please?

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/subhanjansaha&gt;@subhanjansaha&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thank for reporting your issue.
I have tried to replicate your issue but the  directory was created in the right place for me.
Usually, everything happens  in the directory  from there you run  and everything should work fine.
In your case, the  directory was created in   but it should have been created in .
Did you run  from  or did you run  from the  directory ?
From my understanding the  that you used to generate the mixtures is  right ?
If I'm right,  actually contains .wav files not csv so you shouldn't change   to 
What you should try is to simply move the  folder from  to  and go back to the original code where    are given correctly.
Don't hesitate to ask if you still have an issue or if I wasn't clear enough :)

		Good catch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JorisCos&gt;@JorisCos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,  was probably ran from  and that would explain the problem !

 Yes, the  directory was generated within the  directory for me for some reason. However, I can assure you I did not run  directly from the  dir. It was called as a part of the  code, but all I did was run

		Could you please try to re-run the data prep to see if the problem persists please?
We tried this morning and it worked as expected.

@JorisCos Yes, the data directory was generated within the local directory for me for some reason. However, I can assure you I did not run prepare_data.sh directly from the local dir. It was called as a part of the run.sh code, but all I did was run run.sh

Ok can you try as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mpariente&gt;@mpariente&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested  to re run  with the right storage_dir (the same as the one you specified when you ran  for the first time) but before running it you should edit the  like so
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#!/bin/bash

storage_dir=
n_src=
python_path=python

. ./utils/parse_options.sh

current_dir=$(pwd)
## Clone LibriMix repo
#git clone https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix
#
## Run generation script
#cd LibriMix
#. generate_librimix.sh $storage_dir

cd $current_dir
$python_path local/create_local_metadata.py --librimix_dir $storage_dir/Libri$n_src"Mix"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

to avoid redownloading everything
