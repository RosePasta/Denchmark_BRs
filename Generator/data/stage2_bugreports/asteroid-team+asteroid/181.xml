	<summary>set -e not working?</summary>
	<description>
In ConvTasNet run.sh, there's a set -e at the start of the file, so I'd expect the run.sh script to stop for instance if training has failed. But for me it always "falls through" to the next step, e.g. evaluation, which then fails because training hasn't completed.

		Same here, I looked (a bit) at how to propagate the error from python to bash but didn't find the obvious way.
I don't know much about exist codes in python but we could probably use that to communicate the outcome to bash, IDK.
