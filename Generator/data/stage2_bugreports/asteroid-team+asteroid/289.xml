try to install asteroid on Colab, follow the installation steps in README

ERROR: tensorflow 2.3.0 has requirement tensorboard&lt;3,&gt;=2.3.0, but you'll have tensorboard 2.2.0 which is incompatible.
ERROR: torchaudio 0.7.0 has requirement torch==1.7.0, but you'll have torch 1.6.0+cu101 which is incompatible.

and run a recipe

find torchaudio &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/torchaudio/#history&gt;release a new version 0.7.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on Oct 28
fixed it by installing torchaudio 0.6.0 manually
maybe need version limitation on torchaudio in installation script.

		Let's pin torchaudio's version to 0.6.0 for now then. Do you mind submitting a PR?

		Just to be sure, how did you install torchaudio in the first place? Because it does work on my end..

		I found PyTorch have also relased a new version 1.7.0 on Oct 28...
It seems torchaudio 0.7.0 is based on torch 1.7.0, it will crash if you install a lower version like pytorch 1.6.0 (you can try it on colab which is installed 1.6.0 by default)
So, maybe both new version or both old version?

		Oh ok, I thought it didn't work with 1.7.0..
So we'll revert the PR I guess.
Which colab are you talking about by the way?
