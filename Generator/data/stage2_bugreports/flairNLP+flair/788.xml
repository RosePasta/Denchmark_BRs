	<summary>training.log not closed before next model</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Training multiple models in one script results in the training.log files of earlier models including the log output of all subsequent models.
To Reproduce
Do something like this (which might naturally happen during some sort of grid search):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# [create classifier and corpus somehow]
for outdir in ['a', 'b']:
    ModelTrainer(classifier, corpus).train(outdir)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that the contents of b/training.log are also appended to the end of a/training.log.
Expected behavior
Each training.log file should contain only the log output involved in training that model.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Ubuntu
Flair 0.4.1
