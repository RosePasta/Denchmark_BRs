	<summary>AttributeError: module 'tensorflow_core.keras.activations' has no attribute 'swish'</summary>
	<description>
I am very new to this flair package but belive that it can help me resolve the current challenges I am facing right now. I am just trying to get some basics right and while using the following code:
from flair.data import Sentence
sentence = Sentence('The grass is green.')
print(sentence)
I got this error:
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow_core.keras.activations' has no attribute 'swish'
Can someone explain this to me why is this happening? TF is already there on my system and I am not sure why I am getting this error

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ishan42d&gt;@ishan42d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, you're code is working just fine. Here's my print out:

Flair is built up on PyTorch, not on TensorFlow - so i guess it is rather another error on your side and nothing related to flair. You might wanna look at this issue here which seems more related to your problem: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/7333&gt;Issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Reinstalling Tensorflow helped actually! PyTorch was running fine and was not the issue, TF was. Closing this issue
