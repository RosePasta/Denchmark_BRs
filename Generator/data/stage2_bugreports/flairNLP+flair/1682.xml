	<summary>Issue with wandb</summary>
	<description>
I just installed flair with pip install flair. It was installed without any error message. But after I tried to load various embeddings with flair it shows "module 'wandb' has no attribute 'ensure_configured''. After that, I found that no matter whatever module I try to load from flair it shows the same message. Please help!!!!
