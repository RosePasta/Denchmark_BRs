	<summary>PooledFlairEmbeddings:  expected type torch.cuda.FloatTensor but got torch.FloatTensor</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
when loading a trained model with PooledFlairEmbeddings (on GPU), the following error message
is thrown:
raceback (most recent call last):
  File "predict.py", line 31, in &lt;module&gt;
    tagger.predict(tagged_sentence)
  File "/mnt/flair/flair/models/sequence_tagger_model.py", line 300, in predict
    tags, _ = self.forward_labels_and_loss(batch, sort=False)
  File "/mnt/flair/flair/models/sequence_tagger_model.py", line 268, in forward_labels_and_loss
    feature, lengths, tags = self.forward(sentences, sort=sort)
  File "/mnt/flair/flair/models/sequence_tagger_model.py", line 315, in forward
    self.embeddings.embed(sentences)
  File "/mnt/flair/flair/embeddings.py", line 130, in embed
    embedding.embed(sentences)
  File "/mnt/flair/flair/embeddings.py", line 63, in embed

    aggregated_embedding = self.aggregate_op(self.word_embeddings[token.text], local_embedding)
RuntimeError: expected type torch.cuda.FloatTensor but got torch.FloatTensor
Tested with latest  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/commit/cf56e8413cae79707545f5eddf3a88c05810d0d3&gt;cf56e84&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stefan-it&gt;@stefan-it&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for reporting this. Since I don't currently have good access to a GPU machine, could you try loading the pre-trained 'ner-multi-fast-learn' sequence tagger () to see if the problem also applies here?

		I can see no problems with that model :)
Meanwhile I think I found a patch for that issue:
local_embedding = token._embeddings[self.context_embeddings.name]
local_embedding = local_embedding.to(flair.device)
The last line was missing - after adding it, the test mode runs fine after training.
