Language modelling
When I want to create a language model using more than one split training sets, I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Sinas-MacBook-Pro:finnlp sina$ python3 train_LM_flair.py 
Better speed can be achieved with apex installed from https://www.github.com/nvidia/apex.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Following the errors, I could find out that the error is due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/abad7da384260f0b41bedb726af9785aebe196b6/flair/trainers/language_model_trainer.py#L167&gt;this part&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of the  script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; self.train = TextDataset(path / 'train', dictionary, False, self.forward, self.split_on_char,
                                 self.random_case_flip, shuffle_lines=self.shuffle_lines)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from pathlib import Path

from flair.data import Dictionary
from flair.models import LanguageModel
from flair.trainers.language_model_trainer import LanguageModelTrainer, TextCorpus

# are you training a forward or backward LM?
is_forward_lm = True

# load the default character dictionary
dictionary: Dictionary = Dictionary.load('chars')

# get your corpus, process forward and at the character level
corpus = TextCorpus(Path('corpus'),
                    dictionary,
                    is_forward_lm,
                    character_level=True)

# instantiate your language model, set hidden size and number of layers
language_model = LanguageModel(dictionary,
                               is_forward_lm,
                               hidden_size=128,
                               nlayers=1)

# train your language model
trainer = LanguageModelTrainer(language_model, corpus)

trainer.train('resources/taggers/language_model',
              sequence_length=10,
              mini_batch_size=10,
              max_epochs=10)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Directory structure
This is how my training, validation and testing data sets are organized in my working directory:

Sinas-MacBook-Pro:corpus sina$ tree
.
├── test.txt
├── train
│   ├── train_split_1.txt
│   ├── train_split_2.txt
│   ├── train_split_3.txt
│   ├── train_split_4.txt
│   └── train_split_5.txt
└── valid.txt

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS Mojave
Latest version (as of April 10, 2019)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sinaahmadi&gt;@sinaahmadi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
is your training script located at the same (file system) level as test.txt and valid.txt? Then you have to adjust the following object:
from
TextCorpus(Path('corpus')
to just:
TextCorpus(Path('.')
Normally, I would use the following folder structure:
-&gt; corpus/train/*splits
-&gt; corpus/test.txt
-&gt; corpus/valid.txt
-&gt; train.py
I hope that helps :)

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sinaahmadi&gt;@sinaahmadi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - were you able to fix the problem?

		Well, there were a dummy problem with Mac!
The error was caused by the hidden .DS_Store file where macOS saves the directory details in! Setting a restriction over the file extensions such as .txt may be better for future developments.

		Ah ok - then I'll close the issue for now!

		how can you find the problem, really cool. I think the problem is really hard to find &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sinaahmadi&gt;@sinaahmadi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

really want to learn some insights about the debugging
