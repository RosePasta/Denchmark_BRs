	<summary>ner-ontonotes and chunk tagging not working</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When I try tagging a sentence with either ner-ontonotes or pos, i get no output.
My code is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sentence = Sentence('Either by you or somebody, he must be punished.')
tagger = SequenceTagger.load('ner-ontonotes')
tagger.predict(sentence)

for entity in sentence.get_spans('ner-ontonotes'):
    print(entity)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The output is:
2019-10-27 15:40:20,275 loading file /root/.flair/models/en-ner-ontonotes-v0.4.pt
ner and pos however work as expected.
Any idea what I'm doing wrong.
