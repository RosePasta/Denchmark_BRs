	<summary>Perplexity calculation error for single character words ("a", "I")</summary>
	<description>
For example, if I try to calculate the perplexity of a word like "a" or "I", I get the following error:
"Expected tensor for argument &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/pull/1&gt;#1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 'indices' to have scalar type Long; but got CUDAType instead"
However, this works for any words greater than one character in length. I am assuming this is because the perplexity requires at least 2 characters to be calculated? If somebody could confirm or give me a hint to fixing this, that would be awesome.

		Thanks for reporting this. I can reproduce the error with:
lm = FlairEmbeddings("news-forward").lm

perplexity = lm.calculate_perplexity('a')
I'll add a bug label to this issue.
