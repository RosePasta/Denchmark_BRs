	<summary>albert-base-v2 tokenization broken</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The TextClassifier model loading crashes when model is trained on albert-base-v2
To Reproduce

Train a text classifier using albert-base-v2. Save the model.
Now try to load this model in some other machine.
The loading crashes due to SentencePiece file not existing.

Expected behavior
Model should load successfully.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS [e.g. iOS, Linux]: Ubuntu-20-LTS
Version [e.g. flair-0.3.2]: flair-github-master

Additional context
There is workaround that involves monkey patching a bit of code like this
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from types import MethodType
import transformers
vocab_file  = transformers.tokenization_albert.AlbertTokenizer.from_pretrained("albert-base-v2").vocab_file
def _setstate(self, d):  # Method to patch with
    self.__dict__ = d
    try:
        import sentencepiece as spm
    except ImportError:
        logger.warning(
            "You need to install SentencePiece to use AlbertTokenizer: https://github.com/google/sentencepiece"
            "pip install sentencepiece"
        )
        raise
    self.sp_model = spm.SentencePieceProcessor()
    self.sp_model.Load(vocab_file)

# Actual Patching being done here
transformers.tokenization_albert.AlbertTokenizer.__setstate__ = MethodType(
            _setstate, transformers.tokenization_albert.AlbertTokenizer(vocab_file )
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Having to do this everytime is crazy. Maybe we can implement some better way of handling this issue

 issue lies in huggingface lib, similar &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/5040&gt;issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has been opened last week for MarianMT. SentencePiece save its files in cache, thus they can't be found on another machine. Please open a respective issue according to the linked one in huggingface.
