	<summary>torch 1.0.0 and the GLIBC_2.14 in flair installation</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Since torch 1.0.0 in the system which has GLIBC &lt;2.14 should be installed from the source and in Flair 0.4.4 installation it try to reinstall torch 1.0.0.
It causes problem for the system which has GLIBC &lt;2.14.
what is your advice? install from the source ?
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS [e.g. iOS, Linux]: LINUX CUDA 9
Version [e.g. flair-0.3.2]: flair 0.4.0

 - does this problem also occur if you install flair in a new virtual environment?

		I installed flair from source by excluding the torch reinstallation from setup.py!

 Is it working for you? We recommend to install flair in a new virtual environment. Did you try that?
