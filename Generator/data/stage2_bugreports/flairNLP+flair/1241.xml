Problem description
Since upgrading to flair 0.4.4, on import of flair or any of its submodules, my application crashes with the following output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2019-10-23 09:22:34.826579: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:44] Successfully opened dynamic library cudart64_100.dll
2019-10-23 09:22:44.421302: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:44] Successfully opened dynamic library nvcuda.dll
2019-10-23 09:22:44.421558: F tensorflow/stream_executor/lib/statusor.cc:34] Attempting to fetch value instead of handling error Internal: failed to get device attribute 13 for device 0: CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN: unknown error
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As this is a tensorflow error and I did not think flair used tensorflow, I tried removing the portions from my code that import tensorflow. That did not change anything.
Downgrading back to flair 0.4.3 or setting the CUDA device to -1 fixed the issue.
Environment:

OS: Windows 10
Python: 3.7.4
flair Version: 0.4.4
CUDA 10.0
