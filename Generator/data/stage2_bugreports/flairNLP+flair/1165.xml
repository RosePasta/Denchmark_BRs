	<summary>en-sentiment model contains labels that don't match IMDB dataset</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
According to TUTORIAL 2, classification model en-sentiment has been trained on IMDB dataset.
evaluate() function on en-sentiment  model trained on IMDB produces 0 score when tested on test set of IMDB.
Reasons seem to be a change in label names.
Model: ['POSITIVE'], ['NEGATIVE']
dataset: ['pos'], ???
I have not a single prediction with negative label. (which is another issue)
IMDB is not marked as deprecated in source code.
To Reproduce
from flair.datasets import IMDB, DataLoader

from flair.models import TextClassifier

classifier = TextClassifier.load('en-sentiment')
corpus = IMDB()

sentences = list(corpus.test)

test_results, a = classifier.evaluate(data_loader=DataLoader(sentences[:100], batch_size=16))
print(test_results.detailed_results)
Print:
# print(test_results.detailed_results)
MICRO_AVG: acc 0.0 - f1-score 0.0
MACRO_AVG: acc 0.0 - f1-score 0.0
NEGATIVE   tp: 0 - fp: 13 - fn: 0 - tn: 87 - precision: 0.0000 - recall: 0.0000 - accuracy: 0.0000 - f1-score: 0.0000
POSITIVE   tp: 0 - fp: 87 - fn: 0 - tn: 13 - precision: 0.0000 - recall: 0.0000 - accuracy: 0.0000 - f1-score: 0.0000
Expected behavior
A score which is not zero
Solution
Retrain / reshare a new en-sentiment model? // redo IMDB dataset
Context
PiPy version of Flair / same bug on master branch
Note
Btw, the model seems to not work very well.
"I never saw something that bad." -&gt; positive
"I do not like this film" -&gt; positive
"I hate this film" -&gt; negative (finally)

		FYI I ran the Imdb model against some opinion based news and I didn't find the results to be all that meaningful.

		Yes this model was trained using IMDB data, i.e. film related, so its only a sentiment model for movie reviews. I have to check why the label names changed, very strange!

 This is very strange.
I have cleaned  folder.
Then I executed that code
from flair.datasets import IMDB, DataLoader

from flair.models import TextClassifier

classifier = TextClassifier.load('en-sentiment')
corpus = IMDB()

sentences = list(corpus.test)
It downloads what it has to.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then I do
sentences[0].labels
# Out[12]: [pos (1.0)]
And
a = classifier.predict(sentences=sentences[:100],
                   mini_batch_size=16,
                   embedding_storage_mode="none")
a[0].labels
# Out[13]: [POSITIVE (0.9999998807907104)]
So labels ARE different.
Of course, now:
sentences[0].labels
# Out[14]: [POSITIVE (0.9999998807907104)]
as sentence labels are overriden by predict() call.
first line of /home/.../.flair/datasets/imdb/test.txt
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;__label__pos Back in 1982 a little film called MAKING LOVE shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been waiting for years for a good, old-fashioned romance between two men; LATTER DAYS is all that and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, cliché-ridden, and quite corny. That is what makes it so wonderful. There is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the issue of religion, sorry folks, but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now. It is not just the Mormon church that rejects its gay members. Gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this movie. It has a perfect blend of a fantasy-romance grounded in the reality of the day-to-day lives of the characters. If I could give it more than ten stars I would. Good love stories never go out of style; great love stories like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's about time!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To make it short, label from model is POSITIVE and label from dataset is pos.

		PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/pull/1545&gt;#1545&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 adds new sentiment datasets and homogenizes labels across datasets. Also, there is now an option to define "name maps" to map label names to other names.
