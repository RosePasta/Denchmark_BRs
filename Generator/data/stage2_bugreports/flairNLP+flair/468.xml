	<summary>NER entities change per run</summary>
	<description>
Is it possible to have an option to freeze the model at prediction (enable pytorch eval() mode) so that the predictions don't change every run?
For example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.models import SequenceTagger

tagger = SequenceTagger.load("ner")

for i in range(10):
    print("iteration: ", i)
    s = Sentence("Boston is the capital of MA.")
    tagger.predict(s)
    for e in s.get_spans("ner"):
        print(e.text, e.score)
    print("--------------------------")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Results in:

iteration:  0
Boston 0.9999486207962036
iteration:  1
Boston 0.999962568283081
iteration:  2
Boston 0.9981124401092529
MA. 0.6125262379646301
iteration:  3
Boston 0.9999322891235352
MA. 0.5145224928855896
iteration:  4
Boston 0.9999871253967285
iteration:  5
Boston 0.999849796295166
iteration:  6
Boston 0.9999449253082275
iteration:  7
Boston 0.9998575448989868
iteration:  8
Boston 0.9999393224716187
iteration:  9

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dhairyadalal&gt;@dhairyadalal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - are you using flair 0.4.0 installed through pip?
If so, this is a known issue (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/416&gt;#416&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) that we are currently fixing by retraining all models with the newest flair version. On the master branch, the ner model is updated with this fix. So you could check out the master branch and run from there.
Alternatively, you could wait a bit until we push version 0.4.1 to pip. We originally wanted to already have 0.4.1 ready this week, but now it is looking more like end of next week for the release.

		No worries. Appreciate the follow-up. I'll take a look at the main branch.
