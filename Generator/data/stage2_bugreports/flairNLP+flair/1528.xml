	<summary>Flair doesn't work correctly with CPU optimised torch for linux</summary>
	<description>
Description
Error when calling the method _apply of the class flair.models.language_model.LanguageModel:
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flair/models/language_model.py in &lt;genexpr&gt;(.0)
    391 
    392     def _apply(self, fn):
--&gt; 393         major, minor, build, *_ = (int(info)
    394                                 for info in torch.__version__.split('.'))
    395 

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0+cpu'
It is blocking functionality of the library when it comes to embeddings, or language_model definition.
Error cause
Error is caused by parsing torch version (see the line  of the module ). It fails when a CPU specific torch version is being used. For example, the CPU optimised version of torch-1.4.0 for linux (available &lt;denchmark-link:https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.4.0%2Bcpu-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) has .
Solution proposal
Status quo:
def _apply(self, fn):
        major, minor, build, *_ = (int(info)
                                for info in torch.__version__.split('.'))
Fix:
def _apply(self, fn):
        major, minor, *_ = (int(info) for info in torch.__version__.split('.')[:-1])
The object build unpacked from the torch.__version__ parsing result's tuple is not being used, ergo its removal would be a reasonable solution.
Environment:

OS: linux debian 10 (base of the docker image python:3.8.1-slim-buster)
torch==1.4.0+cpu
flair==0.4.5

Instruction to reproduce
Build the image, it will fail due described error.
FROM python:3.8.1-slim-buster AS base

WORKDIR /

RUN apt-get update -y \
  &amp;&amp; pip install --upgrade pip \
  &amp;&amp; pip install --no-cache-dir "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.4.0%2Bcpu-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl" flair==0.4.5

RUN python -c "import flair; from flair.embeddings import StackedEmbeddings, FlairEmbeddings;\
embeddings = StackedEmbeddings([FlairEmbeddings('mix-forward')]);

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kislerdm&gt;@kislerdm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 sorry for the late reply. This issue was fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/1388&gt;#1388&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and will be part of the next Flair release. In the meantime, you can install with:
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/flairNLP/flair.git
That should fix it!
