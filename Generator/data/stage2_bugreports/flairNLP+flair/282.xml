	<summary>Disable logging from dependencies</summary>
	<description>
Currently, the logging configuration is overwritten by the BERT logging set up. Everything is written to stderr, log level is set to DEBUG and no file handler is applied anymore.
To avoid this, we should read our logging configuration from a file and disable existing loggers as described here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/logging.html#configuring-logging&gt;https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/logging.html#configuring-logging&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
