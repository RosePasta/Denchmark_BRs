	<summary>In param_selector.optimize, missing conjugate error when np.var is computed on GPU enabled machine</summary>
	<description>
I am running a simple SequenceTaggerParameterSelector with a few hyperparameter choices and after the very first run, it fails in
In flair/hyperparameter/param_selection.py, param_selector.optimize, with np.var call failing.
When i examined the error, it is in:
var = np.var(curr_scores)
contains a list of Tensor objects bound to cuda:0 in my case and np.var is unable to handle such Tensor types not bound to CPU.
So, I changed it to
var = np.var(list(map(lambda a: a.cpu(), curr_scores)))
and it started working.
May be its already fixed, but just wanted to let know in case its not addressed yet.
