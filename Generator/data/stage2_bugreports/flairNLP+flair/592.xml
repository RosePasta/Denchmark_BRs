	<summary>Permission error after downloading models on Windows 10</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When downloading models/embeddings to disk on Windows 10, a PermissionError is thrown.
To Reproduce
Install FLAIR and Cython:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install Cython
pip install flair
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Running the following code (in a Jupyter Lab environment):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from flair.embeddings import WordEmbeddings
glove_embedding = WordEmbeddings('glove')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
A successful download of the GloVe embeddings. However, it throws a PermissionError after downloading the file:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'C:\\Users\\my-username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpdd72vob1'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS [e.g. iOS, Linux]: Windows
Version [e.g. flair-0.3.2]: 10

		I get the same error using Flair 0.4.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pkg_resources
&gt;&gt;&gt; pkg_resources.get_distribution("flair").version
'0.4.1'
If you re-run the last command (glove_embedding = WordEmbeddings('glove'), it will execute without error

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kevin91nl&gt;@kevin91nl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/seangrant82&gt;@seangrant82&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - could this be related to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/548&gt;#548&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? If so, we pushed a fix into the master branch (but it is not yet part of a pip release). Could you try checking out the master branch to see if the error persists?

		Same issue here.
As a workaround you could manually copy *.pt file from the temp folder to the .flair\embeddings folder.
