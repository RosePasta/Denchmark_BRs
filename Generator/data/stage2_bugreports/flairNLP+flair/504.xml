	<summary>BytePairEmbeddings serialization error</summary>
	<description>
In the current master branch, the BytePairEmbeddings serialization creates problems when serialized on another machine than where they get deserialized.
Specifically, this line causes the problem:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/4b3562eed534e4e305a36d2f22d12961bc6c25d5/flair/embeddings.py#L261&gt;https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/4b3562eed534e4e305a36d2f22d12961bc6c25d5/flair/embeddings.py#L261&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Since this is only a path, this only works if the sentence piece model is already on your local machine under exactly the same path. If I train remotely and then deserialize locally, I get a No such file or directory Error.
