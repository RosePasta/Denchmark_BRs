	<summary>Bad epochs logging counterintuitive</summary>
	<description>
The current logging of the bad_epochs parameter is potentially misleading since it always logs the state of bad epochs at the start of each epoch. This is problematic since each line gives us the results of each epoch (i.e. the state at the end of each epoch).
Goal: log bad_epochs value as it is at the end of each epoch.
So then a log line might begin like this:
33	10:47:51	1	0.0250	2.6336
and may be read as "epoch 33 is bad epoch 1 with a loss of 2.6336".
