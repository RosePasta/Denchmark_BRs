	<summary>Models not backward compatible - AttributeError: 'DocumentRNNEmbeddings' object has no attribute 'use_word_dropout'</summary>

Describe the bug
I created a model using recent Flair from Github. Then I tried to deploy it using code that was running Flair 0.4.3 and it failed to load the model with the following exception.

 are you using the current master branch? If not, could you update to the current state? This error should already be fixed, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/31cc245f45b38dbbc4ddfc0214a2761a45b2b3a9/flair/embeddings.py#L2689&gt;https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/31cc245f45b38dbbc4ddfc0214a2761a45b2b3a9/flair/embeddings.py#L2689&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ak ok - I guess I'll need to recreate the model.
I hope you now have test to ensure backward compatibility now so that models trained with current master branch can be used in production with stable code.

		Ah, sorry I think I misunderstood. We tested for backwards compatibility in the sense that models trained with previous versions (0.4.3) can still be deployed with the version on master branch. But not the other way around (models trained on master and deployed with 0.4.3). We'll release 0.4.4 early next week - I am actually currently putting together the release notes - so the problem might solve itself then.
