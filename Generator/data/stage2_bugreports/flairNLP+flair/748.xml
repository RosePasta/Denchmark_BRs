		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nagrechachirag8&gt;@nagrechachirag8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this is probably because our current method for reading data reads everything into memory. We just pushed a PR into the master branch that lets you train over classification datasets without loading into memory.
If you can work on the master branch, you could try:
from flair.datasets import IMDB

# read corpus
corpus = IMDB()
