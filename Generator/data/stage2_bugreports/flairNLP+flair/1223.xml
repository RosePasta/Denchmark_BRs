Describe the bug
KeyError: 'GRU'

Following the tutorial at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_5_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDINGS.md&gt;https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_5_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDINGS.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i encountered KeyError: 'GRU' when predicting.
Expected behavior
I have updated flair version,  directly restoring model raises with this error, but about 2 months ago everything is ok.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45623193/67078424-d9698a00-f1c3-11e9-9bdb-6ca93de881f1.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS [e.g. iOS, Linux]: centos
Version [e.g. flair-0.3.2]: flair-0.4.2 with error
