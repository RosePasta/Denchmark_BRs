Description
When I use BertEmbeddings:
from flair.embeddings import BertEmbeddings
embedding = BertEmbeddings('bert-base-chinese')
I find that BertEmbeddings('bert-base-chinese') has an error:

Model name 'bert-base-chinese' was not found in model name list (bert-base-uncased, bert-large-uncased, bert-base-cased, bert-large-cased, bert-base-multilingual-uncased, bert-base-multilingual-cased, bert-base-chinese). We assumed 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-chinese.tar.gz' was a path or url but couldn't find any file associated to this path or url.

Environment

OS [Ubuntu 18.04.2]
Version [flair-0.4.1 Python-3.6.7]:

		Odd. And can you download the link '&lt;denchmark-link:https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-chinese.tar.gz&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-chinese.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
' manually? If I click on the link, it immediately triggers a download for me.

		Thanks for your reply, I can download the link manually, but the speed is very slow, I think the problem is that the speed from my country is very slow to visit s3.amazonaws.com.
