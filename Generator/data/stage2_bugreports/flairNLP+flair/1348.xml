Hello,
I am trying to work on flair. Under virtual environment I ran the following commands on jupyter notebook:
from flair.data import Corpus
from flair.datasets import ClassificationCorpus
But non of the flair related commands are working it gives always one error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flair'
I have already installed flair and torch but still its not running on jupyter notebook.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS [e.g. iOS, Linux]: Linux 64-bit
Version [e.g. flair-0.3.2]: flair ==0.4.3
torch==1.1.0

Kindly help,
Thank you.
