	<summary>still issues when loading some models on Win 10</summary>

Using the newest Flair and torch on Win 10 I still get this error for (other models worked):
tagger = SequenceTagger.load('frame-fast')
or
tagger = SequenceTagger.load('frame')
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		I'd say this error is raised because the model has been trained on a UNIX-based OS and you are trying to load it on Windows.

I'd say this error is raised because the model has been trained on a UNIX-based OS and you are trying to load it on Windows.

Models are platform independent, pickled Python objects should be, too.
I train on Linux and run on Macs or Win10, or even embedded systems without a problem. This is an old issue, potentially related to the model size or, as it says in the log, to PosixPaths. The old error talking about that issue was closed and this is why I posted again.
Needless to say, frame loads just fine on Ubuntu and even on the Win10 Linux Subsystem. I'll test OSX later.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dcavar&gt;@dcavar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this is probably the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/1052&gt;#1052&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and only affects trained models that use . These embeddings have a special serialization mechanism that does not seem to travel well across different OS. I am looking into setting up a better testing environment to spot such errors, but realistically it will be a while before we'll fix this.
In the meantime, on thread &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/1052&gt;#1052&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eurekaqq&gt;@eurekaqq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 posted a workaround - does this work for you?

		Thanks!
It works just fine on Linux, but I'll try the portion of code later on a Win10 box later. It would be good, if it would work on both. I teach with that and many students seem to be on Win10. :-)

		This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
