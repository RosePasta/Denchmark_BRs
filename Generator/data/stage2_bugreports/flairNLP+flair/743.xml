	<summary>Loading from Checkpoint issue</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I am training a language model in aws server and loading it from checkpoint from time to time, its working properly, But when I am trying to load a checkpoint(made in an aws server) in google colab, it gives me a Path doesn't exist assertion error. Same is the case other way around.
To Reproduce

Train a model locally(or in an server)
Upload the code and checkpoints in google drive
Mount google drive in a colab notebook
Load the model from checkpoint and try training the model

Expected behavior
Successful loading and training of the model
