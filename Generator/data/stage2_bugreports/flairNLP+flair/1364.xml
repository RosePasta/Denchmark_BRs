	<summary>Error while installing flair</summary>
	<description>
Error: Packages installed from PyPI cannot depend on packages which are not also hosted on PyPI. tiny-tokenizer depends on SudachiDict_core.
However, SudachiDict_core is a chinese model that is also in PyPI. I keep getting this error while installing flair in any environment or version.
