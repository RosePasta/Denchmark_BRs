	<summary>AttributeError: 'WordEmbeddings' object has no attribute 'embeddings'</summary>
	<description>
After executing the following codes:
'''
from flair.models import SequenceTagger
tagger = SequenceTagger.load('multi-ner')
print(tagger)
'''
I got this error:
'''
AttributeError: 'WordEmbeddings' object has no attribute 'embeddings'
'''
Something should be wrong in extracting the embeddings from the pretrained multi-ner model.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jind11&gt;@jind11&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I was not able to reproduce the error. Have you found out more or got it working on your end?

 The same thing happened to me as well, you need to download models from the web, it does not occur if you trained those models.

		Got the same error when loading 'ner-fast', with torch==1.0.0 and flair==0.4.2.
It seems that the pre-trained model is based on old versions. So I checked the release log and rolled back to torch==0.4.1 and flair==0.3.0 and it worked.
