Describe the bug
I am trying to install the version 0.4.2 with pip, but I'm getting the following error.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Collecting flair==0.4.2 (from -r requirements-embeddings.txt (line 10))

I downloaded the file https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/0f/0e/1600bfbc2f5d95160532eb78edb2cd29840d005f9f8050bec62a98833d42/flair-0.4.2.tar.gz and the file requirements.txt actually doesn't exists. But there is a file with requirements inside flair.egg-info/requires.txt.
The problem is that inside setup.py, on line 3, the setup is trying to get the requirements.txt file:
with open("requirements.txt") as f:
Im running the install with pip install --no-cache-dir --compile --global-option=build_ext flair==0.4.2
Is it really a bug with the deployed library? Or am I missing something?
Environment

OS [python:3.6-slim docker image]:
Version [flair-0.4.2]:

		Hm I think most people can install directly with pip install flair. Do you maybe somehow have an old pip version or are not using Python 3.6+?

		It seems like its the flags --no-cache-dir --compile --global-option=build_ext  I'm using in pip.
I have used the same flags in version 0.4.1 and it worked.
I think the version 0.4.2 might have some configuration problem when these flags are used.

		I am having the same problem with 0.4.5. I think this is a bug starting from 0.4.2.
