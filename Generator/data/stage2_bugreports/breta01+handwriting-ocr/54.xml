I attached my Issue,
I'm Trying to Train the CharClassifier model with my own image dataset, where i converted the image with txt file of bounding box.
But still it throws me key error of '1' and '.'.

		Sorry for delayed answer. The issue is quite simple, go to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Breta01/handwriting-ocr/blob/master/ocr/datahelpers.py&gt;ocr/datahelpers.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 there are in variable  specified all characters which the model can use. There are also some special characters with accents, so remove them first and than add your own characters, for example:
CHARS = ['', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I',
         'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S',
         'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', 'a', 'b', 'c',
         'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
         'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w',
         'x', 'y', 'z', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6',
         '7', '8', '9', '.', ',']
Then you will also have to change number of characters char_size in your code.

		Thanks Bret,
It solved my error.
I got Another Question,
I have been training CharClassifier of CNN model,
I came across Train_steps,Test_iteration,save_iteration, and Batch Size
while I'm giving giving default value for training for 200 word images,and train_steps of 1000 it gives accuracy of 80.
But i need Accuracy above 95,in which OCR have to predict correct output.
may i know the Correct way for that.
