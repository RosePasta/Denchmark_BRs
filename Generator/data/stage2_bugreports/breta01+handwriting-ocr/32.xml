	<summary>Bug of COLOR_BGR2RGB ?</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I am trying to use your code that crops the image for scanned photos.
But here is what I get for output (knowing that the original image is a classic image with normal colors).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://i.imgur.com/8r1WWh6.png&gt;https://i.imgur.com/8r1WWh6.png&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Have you an idea of what is the problem?
Thank you and have a great day.

		Can you share what code exactly produces this image (load and output function)? And what version of OpenCV do you have?
It might be strange, but OpenCV uses BGR as a default format for images.
