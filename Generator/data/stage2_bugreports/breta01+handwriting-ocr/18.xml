Hello,
I have started using the charclassifier model.
I am running the OCR.ipynb and using the following image:  "data/textdet/2.jpg"
The output is very wierd. It cant detect any character.
I think there is some thing wrong with the bounding boxes that we get after recalculating them as per the ratio
Another error that I am getting is:
**IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
 in ()
1 # Crop image and get bounding boxes
----&gt; 2 crop = page.detection(image)
3 implt(crop)
4 bBoxes = words.detection(crop)
~\handwriting-ocr-master-final\ocr\page.py in detection(image)
17                                    np.ones((5, 11)))
18     # Countours
---&gt; 19     pageContour = findPageContours(closedEdges, resize(image))
20     # Recalculate to original scale
21     pageContour = pageContour.dot(ratio(image))

1925     slice2[axis] = slice(None, -1)
1926     slice1 = tuple(slice1)
IndexError: list assignment index out of range**
This for the image: "data/textdet/1.jpg" and 3.jpg and many more.
Please help by checking it for yourself.

		Hi,
I fixed the issue in new commit. I also want to point out that in the folder data/textdet/ the pages are already cropped; therefore, you can skip the page.detection() function.

		Thanks Breta,
Now the output for your images is perfectly working.
However I am getting some issue with the following image.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36536522/37582315-700bcdfc-2b72-11e8-9da5-2c58cb92cd5b.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried with and without page.detection(image) but it did not work.
Output is like this:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36536522/37582437-efa105aa-2b72-11e8-93f7-27ea8210b33d.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think there is some problem with bounding boxes. The co-ordinates returned are not proper.
You can try it for yourself. I can send you the image on your email if you give it.
