Thanks Breta,
Now the output for your images is perfectly working.
However I am getting some issue with the following image.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36536522/37582315-700bcdfc-2b72-11e8-9da5-2c58cb92cd5b.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried with and without page.detection(image) but it did not work.
Output is like this:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36536522/37582437-efa105aa-2b72-11e8-93f7-27ea8210b33d.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think there is some problem with bounding boxes. The co-ordinates returned are not proper.
You can try it for yourself. I can send you the image on your email if you give it.

		Hi,
I fixed the bug, it was error in rescaling of the bounding boxes.
Also I working on new future, so you can try running word detection like:
bBoxes = words.detection(crop, join=True)
This should join bounding box of word and dot above the 'i',
Hope it heps.
