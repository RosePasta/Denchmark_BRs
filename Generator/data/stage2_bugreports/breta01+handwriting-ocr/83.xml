		Thanks for the information. There's not much I can do. You should try looking, if it is stored somewhere else.
Please let me know if you find a new link

		Here is the thing. You can still find the dataset stored on their site. However since they took down the page with all the information and licensing, I won't be sharing it here. But the wayback machine can do the trick ðŸ˜‰
