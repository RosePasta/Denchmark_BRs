	<summary>[Meson] Fix build break of meson on launchpad/nnstreamer</summary>
	<description>
This is a sub-issue of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/issues/1440&gt;#1440&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

If it is simple to create debian package for meson 0.50.1, I will write new my own debian-packaging related files for it.
Otherwise, 1) Just skip some failed tests or 2) choose other ways to fix the build break easily will be done.
