	<summary>[apptest/fake-cam] /dev/video0 is normal?</summary>
	<description>
It  is strange. It seems that enabling /dev/video0 (device node) is not stable. As we all know, the device node is used by PR-checker/apptest when a PR is submitted by a contributor.


Frequency: sometimes

Nov-05-2018: @leemgs found the issue by running "$ dmesg" command.  At that time,  I could not find /dev/video0 file at 15:00 Nov-05-2018 even though PRs are submitted beforehand.



How to reproduce:

Run the below scripts. Then you can check a created time of /dev/video* file.



ubuntu@ip-172-31-27-164:~$ while true; do ls -al /dev/video*; sleep 5; clear; done

Nov-06-2018: It's okay.  TAOS-CI/apptest is normal.

		Will you try "vivid driver"?

		No. From our experiment, we will use continually v4l2lookback.ko instead of vivid.ko module to support a fake USB camera based Gstreamer hooking operation.
