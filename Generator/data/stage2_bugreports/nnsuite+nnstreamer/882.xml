		Uh.. this is typecasting float-to-uint problem.
Didn't we resolve this already???
PTAL &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wooksong&gt;@wooksong&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  (If my memory serves right, it was you who brought this up and solved it)

 Right. The typecasting float-to-uint issue was resolved and unit TCs &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/issues/8&gt;#8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
/&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/issues/9&gt;#9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 were not failed until tensor_transform is refactored. Anyway, I will look into it.
While I am writing the comment, you've already submitted the PR to resolve this issue. Thanks.
