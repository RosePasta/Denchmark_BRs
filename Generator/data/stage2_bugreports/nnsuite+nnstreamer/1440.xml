		I am trying to upload pytorch debian to nnstreamer/ppa
Building pytorch for architecture  and  failed because building  failed - detailed logs - &lt;denchmark-link:https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+build/16798360/+files/buildlog_ubuntu-bionic-armhf.nnstreamer_0.1.3.0-0~201905151322~ubuntu18.04.1_BUILDING.txt.gz&gt;https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+build/16798360/+files/buildlog_ubuntu-bionic-armhf.nnstreamer_0.1.3.0-0~201905151322~ubuntu18.04.1_BUILDING.txt.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The error however is different compared to the error in the log posted by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/again4you&gt;@again4you&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The current error in nnstreamer launchpad for xenial is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 sbuild-build-depends-nnstreamer-dummy : Depends: meson (&gt;= 0.40) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
apt-get failed.
Package installation failed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Maybe... we need to build meson in launchpad/nnstreamer first.
It appears to emit errors in "test" stage; thus, the first workaround will be "disable test" in the meson debian build script.
