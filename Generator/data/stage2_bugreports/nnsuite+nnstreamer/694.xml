	<summary>[TF-Lite/Minor Bug] a minor error occured with new tensorflow-lite-dev package</summary>
	<description>
With new tensorflow-lite-dev package from launchpad, below error is detected.

nnapi error: unable to open library libneuralnetworks.so

When I confronted with this error in the past, the version of tensorflow was too low(&lt;1.9).
However, please check my environment.
$ sudo dpkg -l | grep tensorflow
ii  tensorflow-dev                                       1.9.0-0~201810220136~ubuntu16.04.1                    amd64        Tensorflow development headers and object file
ii  tensorflow-lite-dev                                  1.9.0-0~201810220136~ubuntu16.04.1                                                 amd64        Tensorflow Lite development headers and object file
When I use the previous version(still 1.9, but the old package) the error has not appeared like below.
$ sudo dpkg -l | grep tensorflow
ii  tensorflow-dev                                       1.9.0-0~201810220136~ubuntu16.04.1                    amd64        Tensorflow development headers and object file
ii  tensorflow-lite-dev                                  1.9.0                                                 amd64        Tensorflow Lite development headers and object file
