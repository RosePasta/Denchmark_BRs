	<summary>Subplugin detects tensorflow even when its disabled</summary>
	<description>
CAPI unittest nnstreamer_capi_singleshot.unavailable_fw_tf_n fails when running this unit-test without enabling tensorflow.
This is because the subplugin returns that tensorflow is available (although it is disabled).
This bug can be replicated by building nnstreamer on ubuntu with meson with additional flag of -Denable-capi and testing build/tests/tizen_capi/unittest_tizen_capi.
