SSAT is not executed. (bash/find error?)
Then, ninja install fails

On the other hand, aarch64 is properly built &amp; tested.

		It is now working and we still don't know why it didn't work.
Let's not touch anything and see what happens for about a week. If it happens again, let's look into it again.

		I wonder why the problem occurs repeatedly only in armv7l.
In addition, if I perform it again manually, it works normally.
I will see if there is any conflict with other tasks at that time.

Removing unnecessary debian files...
The binary files will be temporarily archived in /var/cache/pbuilder/ folder.
mv: '../*.deb'를 설명할 수 없음: 그런 파일이나 디렉터리가 없습니다


&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and, you might need --clean option for daily gbs build.

		Looks like the issue is gone;;;; but still no clue.
I'll wait for a few days more and if the error does not occur again, I'll close this.
