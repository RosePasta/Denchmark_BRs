Please add URLs to get all the files required by the examples (i.e., *.tflite, labels.txt)


If possible, we may use github.com/nnsuite/testcase/... ( as long as the files are not touched by us, we do not need to worry administrative problems.)


/dev as an example installation path is not good. Some people will really use it and possible break the system. Let's use something not harmful such as ~/lib/ or ~/test/

The requirement is to allow a developer with a clean system (a newly installed Ubuntu) to build, install, and run the example.
