If we add tensor_converter (other tensor_* filters are not tested) into a pipeviz ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/virinext/pipeviz&gt;https://github.com/virinext/pipeviz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) gstreamer pipeline, we soon get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mzx@kohaku:/source/AutoDrv/pipeviz$ ./pipeviz  --gst-plugin-path ../NNStreamer/build/gst/tensor_converter/:../NNStreamer/build/gst/tensor_filter/:../NNStreamer/build/gst/tensor_decoder/
failed to get the current screen resources

this segmentation fault is caused because there is no data GstTensor_Filter_Framework *fw
in gst_tensor_filter_property_process function.
in case of nnstreamer filter example(working), example app loads tensorflow-lite model, and use filter with tensorflow-lite
but pipeviz, there is no steps to load which nnframework sub-plugin filter use .
so I think there are two possible cadidates to use pipeviz with our nnstreamer.
case 1.
Make own complete filter that loads specific nnstreamer data model.
Pros : no need to modify pipeviz
Cons: have to make every filters with every nnframework
case 2.
Modify pipeviz that allows filter could load nnframework and load data model.
Pros: no need to make every filters that suits for every specific nnframework(tensorflow, tensorflow-lite,caffe ...)
Cons: need to modify pipeviz and don't know it would really works

		when running Pipeviz, all elements are in run-time. so when changing tensor filter's property, set property is
called while run-time. but currently, tensor filter's set property method does not allows set property in run-time with assertion codes. so will be considered allow set property while run-time when pipeviz runnig mode.
