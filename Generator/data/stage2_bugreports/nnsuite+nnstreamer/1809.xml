	<summary>[pytorch] Try/Catch for the first run</summary>
	<description>
PyTorch does not have an interface to get the shape of an input. This makes it impossible to verify the shape of the input set by the user without doing the actual. However, this creates a possibility of a run failing, and causing a crash without any handling. I suggest that the first run can be wrapped in a try/catch, so as to exit gracefully for some of the errors - as this wont catch errors like segmentation fault.
