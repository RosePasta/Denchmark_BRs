	<summary>GstTensorFilterProperties elements should not be modified</summary>
	<description>
Currently, custom and python extension of tensor filters modifies their own GstTensorFilterProperties object based on the model file.
However, this creates problems when multiple such tensor filters are used in the same pipeline with model file which have different characteristics.
This information should be rather stored in the private data of the extension.
