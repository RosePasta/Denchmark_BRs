	<summary>[Bug] Often GstCaps is assumed to have only one GstStructure</summary>
	<description>
Often, in the code, we assume that a GstCaps may have a single instance of GstStructure.
Although it is true for most cases, it is sometimes not true.
We need to fix them. They are potentially dangerous.
