	<summary>[Native] TFLite examples are not working</summary>
	<description>
There are a few examples of TFLite in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnsuite/nnstreamer-example/tree/master/native&gt;nnstreamer-example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 repository.
I detected the examples related to TFLite are not working now.
I don't know the reason intuitively.
