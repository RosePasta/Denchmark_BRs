&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Although the log looks like build was successful, however it was failed (the GBS command exited with status 1). This can be confirmed as - upon completion, GBS posts a done log like below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;info: Done
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which is missing from the above.
Until solved, please use  to rebuild the PR.

		I'm no more seeing such issues; thus I assume it's resolved.
