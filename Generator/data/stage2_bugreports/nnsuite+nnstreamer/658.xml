	<summary>[CI/apptest] Python apptest can't find nnstreamer plugin.</summary>
	<description>
In CI server,  Apptest error message is below.
** Message: start app..
** Message: finished to load labels, total 1001
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "nnstreamer_example_filter.py", line 241, in &lt;module&gt;
    example.run_example()
  File "nnstreamer_example_filter.py", line 75, in run_example
    'tensor_filter framework=tensorflow-lite model=' + self.tflite_model + ' ! '
GLib.Error: gst_parse_error: no element "tensor_filter" (1)
C tests have no problem.
Only python test can't find 'tensor_filter' plugin.
Python packages are already installed.
run command: python nnstreaemr_example_filter.py
Can I get a hint about them?

		Please describe the path (pwd) of your execution and other environments (executions from git clone to where you get the error.)

		Anyway, I think you need to do $ export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=${the_location_where_you_have_libnnstreamer.so} before running the python script.
And if you did't set the variable, this is not a bug. :)
