		Found the reason,
It is uncovered bugs of nnstreamer.
The new test cases from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/commit/f987fbc2c304ad5ee36ddf4c7cc4df1fc8e9d2c9&gt;f987fbc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are supposed to "FAIL" if "nnapi" is not enabled. However, in x86/x64 systems they should FAIL.
Thus, we need to update /tests/nnstreamer_filter_tensorflow_lite/runTest.sh.
