	<summary>Unable to reset single API invoke timeout</summary>
	<description>
Setting single API invoke timeout using ml_single_set_timeout considers the input argument of timeout of 0 as invalid.
However, this does not allow resetting the timeout to 0 once set to a non-zero value.
As timeout == 0 has a meaning, how about allow setting timeout to 0.
