	<summary>Bug/Suggestion. TAOS-CI (or config) update</summary>
	<description>
Whenever there is pkg name or version changes in Tizen:Base, we often get gbs build errors, which requires gbs-clean.
Although we can resolve this manually by cleaning up gbs-root or go gbs-clean whenever we see this issue, there are mechanisms possibly avoid such issues automatically.
Approach 1.

Fix gbs. Let it clean up rpm-db if obs repo is updated.

The ideal and clean fix.
Effective upstream: https://review.tizen.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=tools/gbs.git;a=summary
Used-to-be upstream: https://github.com/intel/gbs



Approach 2.

Do gbs build --clean every Monday (cron.daily)

The dumbest, but quite effective fix.
If release engineers update Tizen:Base during weekdays, this will fail and we'll need to clean up manually.


Evolved version: do gbs build --clean ${iterate-all-arch} if http://download.tizen.org/snapshots/tizen/base/ gets update. (detect with cron.d)

Simplest, fully-automated, and possibly robust as Approach 4.



Approach 3.

Add web interface (a button) to do gbs build --clean or rm -rf $GBSROOT

Kinda manual, but not that PITA.



Approach 4.

When TAOS detects gbs build errors, it reads the fail log and if it appears that it has failed before %prep / %build section, retry once with --clean option

The simplest, fully-automated, and robust method.



If anyone's upset with the outage of 2010-01-14's GBS failures, you are the one who may dare to do this :)
This is glitches created by using the "latest" symbolic links, which change target locations for every snapshot release.

		We've applied the temporal solution.
