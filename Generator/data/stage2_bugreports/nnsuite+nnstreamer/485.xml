	<summary>[Bug Report] Unit Test Not Reliable?</summary>

With GBS, I'm seeing some critical warning messages:

		This is mainly because some unit tests which are to set/get non-existing property or signal as below.

Code: https://github.com/nnsuite/nnstreamer/blob/master/tests/nnstreamer_sink/unittest_sink.cpp#L444

  /** try to set/get unknown property */
  g_object_set (g_test_data.sink, "unknown-prop", 1, NULL);
  g_object_get (g_test_data.sink, "unknown-prop", &amp;unknown, NULL);
  EXPECT_EQ (unknown, -1);

  /** unknown signal */
  handle_id = g_signal_connect (g_test_data.sink, "unknown-sig",
      (GCallback) _new_data_cb, NULL);
  EXPECT_EQ (handle_id, 0);
IMO, it is not a serious problem but just warning. However, we need to make a more better to look pretty. One of possible solutions is to simply remove this test case or to check the property by calling g_object_class_list_properties() function.

, what about your opinion?

		In my opinion, this is unnecessary testcase. I will remove this testcase.

		Actually, this part,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[   29s] (gst-plugin-scanner:23073): GStreamer-WARNING **: Failed to load plugin './gst/tensor_filter/libtensor_filter.so': libtensor_filter_tflitecore.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

looks especially dangerous.
