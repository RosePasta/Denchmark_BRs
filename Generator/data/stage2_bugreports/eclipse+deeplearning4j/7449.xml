hi I have a MultiLayerConfiguration that I've serialized with dl4j v1.0.0-beta3. I'm now trying to deserialize it with the SNAPSHOT version of dl4j and I'm getting this error:
https://gist.github.com/daanvdn/a323276f6c6e90354a254a845146ae1b#file-deserialization_error-java
Could anybody suggest how I can edit the json so as to avoid this error? The json is here:

thanks @AlexDBlack, I'm not sure I still have the exact some code, but I think this is it : https://gist.github.com/daanvdn/a323276f6c6e90354a254a845146ae1b#file-createmultilayerconfiguration-java
