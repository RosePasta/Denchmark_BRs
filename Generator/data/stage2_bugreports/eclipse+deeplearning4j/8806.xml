	<summary>nd4j not compatibel with java 7</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The official description of nd4j states that it is compatible with java 7. We are running on a quite old tech stack and updating to a newer java version is an ongoing process which will take a few additional months from now. If it is possible to reintroduce compatibility with java 7, we'd really appreciate that.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following code snippet runs on java 7 without exceptions:
INDArray x = Nd4j.zeros(3,4);
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Actual behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

An exception is thrown. See gist: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/mheck136/91e2e10ba61a7db77b7b96055bf9bec1&gt;https://gist.github.com/mheck136/91e2e10ba61a7db77b7b96055bf9bec1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


nd4j version: 1.0.0-beta6
Platform information: Windows Server 2016, Oracle Java 1.7 Update 80

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Additional information:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I already opened a thread here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://community.konduit.ai/t/java-7-compatibility-issues/306&gt;https://community.konduit.ai/t/java-7-compatibility-issues/306&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I think it would be nice to get some snapshots out with this fixed and tested before the release.

 Do you know exactly where to fix this in the pom.xml files?

 I think the particular class referenced in the stacktrace is  which is located in the  module. The pom of that module specifies source and target version as 8 (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/blob/cd0e62ffaf4579207c6e57915ad7a20a1208f95b/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-backend-impls/nd4j-native/pom.xml#L233&gt;link to the very pom&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
What I'm not sure about is whether other modules need to be adjusted as well.

 Great! If you could send a pull request for that one at least, we'll get this tested, and you'll also get snapshots to try out once merged: &lt;denchmark-link:https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/config/config-snapshots&gt;https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/config/config-snapshots&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Sorry for the mess. I took me some time to create a correctly signed commit.

 No problem! Let us know if you encounter any other such issues with 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
