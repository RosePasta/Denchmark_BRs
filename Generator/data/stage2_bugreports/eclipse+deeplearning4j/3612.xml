	<summary>VPTree returns maximum three results</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

VPTree.search() only returns a maximum of three results, even when k is set to something higher than three. However, setting it to less than three works.
Here's a gist: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/anonymous/35b305d56584d8870f5f1746b515aaab&gt;https://gist.github.com/anonymous/35b305d56584d8870f5f1746b515aaab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Here's the full code to reproduce:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import org.deeplearning4j.clustering.sptree.DataPoint;
import org.deeplearning4j.clustering.vptree.VPTree;
import org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.INDArray;
import org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class KnnOnlyThreeNeighbors {
    final static private int numRows = 1000;
    final static private int numCols = 100;
    final static private int numNeighbors = 42;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        INDArray points = Nd4j.rand(numRows, numCols);
        VPTree tree = new VPTree(points, "cosinesimilarity");

        INDArray query = Nd4j.rand(new int[]{numCols});
        List&lt;DataPoint&gt; results = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        List&lt;Double&gt; distances =new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        tree.search(query, numNeighbors, results, distances);
        if (results.size() != numNeighbors)
            throw new RuntimeException("Expected " + numNeighbors + " results, found " + results.size());
        if (distances.size() != numNeighbors)
            throw new RuntimeException("Expected " + numNeighbors + " distances, found " + distances.size());
    }
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 I'm going to step through in debugger to see if I can figure out the source of this.

		OK, I managed to create an example where it returned 7 results instead of 3, but that was still less than k=10.
