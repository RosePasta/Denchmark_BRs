	<summary>WorkspaceMode.SEPARATE does not work while SINGLE works somewhat</summary>

0.8.0 works fine and keeps improving each epoch for this code. 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT with single works for one epoch and fails on the second. Separate workspacemode does not work at all. Trains to 11%
Console output with single:

Epoch 0 trains to 82%, epoch 1 trains to 10.7% (9 outcomes)
Console output with separate:

		Show TrainUtil too please. Model you've shown can't fail regardless of workspace mode. So it has to be something with your training approach.

		Aha. That explains. Please get rid of ALL AsyncDataSetIterators, just do not use them and try again.
I think there's just race condition happens internally.

		Removing AsyncDataSetIterators solves the issue for me. Snapshot now trains as 0.8.0.

		Please try latest snapshot, such issues should be fixed now. Please try and confirm/decline.

		Closing this as inactive - we haven't seen any workspace issues for a while. We can reopen if it reoccurs.
