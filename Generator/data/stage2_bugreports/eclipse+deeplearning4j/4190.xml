	<summary>deeplearning4j - nlp - tokenizerFactory / tokenizerfactory - compilation error</summary>
	<description>
I tried to import deeplearning4j 0.9.2 SNAPSHOT in Eclipse as a Java project. I received this error:
The project was not built due to "A resource exists with a different case: '/deeplearning4j/bin/org/deeplearning4j/text/tokenization/tokenizerFactory'.". ....
I found in chinese nlp "tokenizerFactory!, but other has " tokenizerfactory"
I use Windows (10).

		You don't need to do do snapshots. Just use normal maven please. If you are new to maven, follow a few tutorials on intellij/maven.  The chinese tokenizer is available in 0.9.1as a simple maven dependency. You don't need to do this import.

		To solve this problem is probably necessary only rename one folder. Whay is this problem?

		You mean we have capitalized folder/package name somewhere?

		Hmm..I'm not sure what could have changed if any, it's right here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/misc/activationfunctions/CustomActivationExample.java&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/misc/activationfunctions/CustomActivationExample.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The package name declarations are right. I'm suspcious because we haven't touched the chinese module.

Yes, minor bug was unnoticed earlier. Easy fix.
