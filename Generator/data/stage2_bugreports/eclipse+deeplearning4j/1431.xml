	<summary>SequenceVectors.java is plotting constant minLearningRate instead of current learning rate</summary>
	<description>
Just a minor issue but just so you guys don't forget to change that :P
SequenceVectors plots the minLearningRate which should actually be the current learning rate I guess:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;log.info("Epoch: [" + currentEpoch+ "]; Words vectorized so far: [" + wordsCounter.get() + "];  Lines vectorized so far: [" + linesCounter.get() + "]; learningRate: [" + minLearningRate + "]");
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

See: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-scaleout/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/models/sequencevectors/SequenceVectors.java#L199&gt;SequenceVectors.java#L199&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
