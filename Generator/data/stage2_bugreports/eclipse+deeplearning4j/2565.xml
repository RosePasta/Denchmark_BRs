	<summary>FileStatsStorage: MapDB file concurrent access issues</summary>
	<description>
When using FileStatsStorage in combination with ParallelWrapper and DL4J UI in the same JVM, there appears to be a lot of concurrent file access and eventually a deadlock. Worth examining, perhaps throwing an exception to tell the user to use remote router.

		The suspect here according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/crockpotveggies&gt;@crockpotveggies&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the use of MapDB in a highly concurrent environment.
Note that standard Spark training insertions and 'run UI in a separate JVM' for reads should be OK.
I have not encountered this in any of my testing to date, but haven't tested parallel wrapper + FileStatsStorage extensively.
J7FileStatsStorage (based on SQLite) is a possible workaround.

		I'll expect to create a reproducible repo I can share in the next week and
will DM to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AlexDBlack&gt;@AlexDBlack&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
