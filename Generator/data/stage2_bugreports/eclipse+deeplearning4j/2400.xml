	<summary>StaticWord2vec.lookupTable : java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Method isn't implemented</summary>

While trying to run Word2vecSentimentimentRNN example with 0.7 version, I get this error. I just moved from 0.5 on which it was working fine, but I need staticWord2vec implementation for this example to work with GPUs.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Method isn't implemented. Please use usual Word2Vec implementation
