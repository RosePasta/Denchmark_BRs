	<summary>NPE with KerasFlatten</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have this Model in Python:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(num_words,
                    EMBEDDING_DIM,
                    weights=[embedding_matrix],
                    input_length=MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH,
                    trainable=False))

model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When I import it using DL4J, I get to this part:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/d5bb984b19e9e3125f5d8d76999627f021084083/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/layers/KerasFlatten.java#L68&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/d5bb984b19e9e3125f5d8d76999627f021084083/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/layers/KerasFlatten.java#L68&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The "InputType" is of type "InputTypeFeedForward" and thus the method returns null.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://deeplearning4j.org/doc/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/inputs/InputType.InputTypeFeedForward.html&gt;https://deeplearning4j.org/doc/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/inputs/InputType.InputTypeFeedForward.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Causing an exception in "getOutputType"

 Is this a bug or just something that wasn't implemented because it wouldn't work straightforwardly anyway?

 in DL4J the output type of an embedding layer is already of FeedForward type, hence the KerasFlatten preprocessor in its current form is not suited for the job (it returns , because it expects to only flatten RNN and CNN types).
I haven't found a solution to this yet, but just wanted to let you know that I keep investigating. Fwiw, if you drop the flatten in the above model, it works as intended.

		Thanks for the update!

I'll try but I believe that the Embedding returns a 2x2 matrix and that you need the Flatten to make it 1D in order to feed it to the neural network in Dense(128

 I'm reasonably sure this is closed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/4936&gt;#4936&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (sorry, this slipped my attention)
