		Noticed swallowed exceptions in ParallelWrapper (inside Thread.run after start model fitting). If model contains errors, training hangs without info about exception. Please fix, thank you.

		Actually, ParallelWrapper is going to get overhaul for 0.7.0. It was just test tool initially. So if you have any ideas/features/bugs in mind - feel free to post them here, feedback is always welcome.
