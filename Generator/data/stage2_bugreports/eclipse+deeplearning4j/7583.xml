	<summary>DL4J/ND4J: Recent new test failures</summary>
	<description>
These are mostly new failures in the last few days (native sort and RegressionTest100b3 are a bit older). Not due to my most recent PR (failing on master before that): &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/7577&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/7577&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The TFGraphTestAllSameDiff test failures are all new in last few days

		OK, the 3 RNN failures and the MLP failure are all due to LayerNorm - last changes to layer_norm op was here - timing fits: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/7311&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/7311&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I can't see any problems on the java side, so this may be a native issue... Also not sure if it's forward pass, backprop, or both. cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/treo&gt;@treo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Strided slice gradient and LocallyConnected2D failure may be related (former uses slice in BP).

		Strided slice backprop (and locally connected 1d/2d), and RegressionTest100b3.testCustomLayer fixed.

		Everything else is fixed at this point I think; closing in favor of this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/7593&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/7593&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
