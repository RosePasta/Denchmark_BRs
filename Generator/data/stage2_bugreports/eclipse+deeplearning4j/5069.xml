	<summary>CNN Differences between 1.0.0-alpha and master</summary>
	<description>
This config/training (same as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5068&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5068&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) run on 1.0.0-alpha and SNAPSHOT differ. Though they are consistent between runs on the one version.
Windows 10, CUDA 9.1, no CUDNN

		Confirmed - but it turns out that:
(a) This is only present when the UI is used with 1.0.0-alpha (i.e., no-UI and with-UI training curves differ over time with 1.0.0-alpha)
(b) No UI - both versions (alpha and snapshot) have identical training curves
(c) With UI on 1.0.0-alpha: has an identical training curve to no UI (i.e., works as expected)
Note that the difference isn't great: it starts to diverge after about 20 iterations...
Note also that the snapshot ("SS") lines aren't visible as they are hidden by the alpha no-UI line.

Raw scores vs. iteration:
