	<summary>Tests: conv_5 graph problem</summary>
	<description>
Unfortunately, conv_5 graph has no practical use in tests, and won't be passing in nearest future.
Reason is: there's normal random used within, so unless we have the same rng as TF - results will be never the same.

		It looks like a bug in TF freeze_graph. The random normal is used the same way as with weights to generate initial values. It should get converted to a constant the same way but isn't.
