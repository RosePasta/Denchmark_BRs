	<summary>NativeImageLoader asMatrix() returning 0</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to load an image using NativeImageLoader on Android using the function asMatrix which receives a File, opencv_core.Mat, InputStream, etc. I've tested asMatrix with a grayscale image, RGB and BGR but the values are always 0, the same code on linux and it works perfectly!
I'm using deeplearning4j on version 1.0.0-beta
Here is the code:
               NativeImageLoader loader = new NativeImageLoader(height, width, channels);
               INDArray image = loader.asMatrix(image_mat);
               opencv_core.Mat roi = loader.asMat(image);
               int[] shape = image.shape();
               for (int some : shape) {
                   Log.i("shape", some + "");
               }
               for (int k = 0; k &lt; shape[1]; k++) {
                   for (int i = 0; i &lt; shape[2]; i++) {
                       for (int j = 0; j &lt; shape[3]; j++) {
                           Log.i("before_norm_" + k + "_" + i + "_" + j, image.getDouble(1, k, i, j) + "");
                       }
                   }
               }
Observation: The image exists, I've checked!
Observation 2: I've used another loaders, such as  ImageLoader, AndroidNativeImageLoader and still doesn't work

		1.0.0-SNAPSHOT is available for android development? I've followed this tutorial of &lt;denchmark-link:https://deeplearning4j.org/android&gt;Using deep learning and neural network in applications android&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://deeplearning4j.org/snapshots&gt;Using snapshots...&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it have some failures on build time

		Try to run `mvn -U compile` before building your project.

		I've execute the command above and build again build.gradle file, it works, but now the project doesn't see opencv packages

		It's probably looking for the opencv artifact with version 3.4.2-1.4.2.
