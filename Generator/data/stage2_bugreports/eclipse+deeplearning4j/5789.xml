	<summary>SameDiff: Conv1D configuration incorrect?</summary>
	<description>
Refers to data format as NWHC, and has isNHWC... yet conv1d should only have 3 dimensions for the input data?

		yes, this is wrong. I'd suggest to go with isNHC, as this would also align with libnd4j:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    int isNCW      = block.getIArguments()-&gt;size() &gt; 4 ? !INT_ARG(4) : 1;       // 0-NCH,  1-NHC
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
