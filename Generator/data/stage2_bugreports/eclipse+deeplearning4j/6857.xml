	<summary>ND4J/Libnd4j: Array equality with infinite values fails</summary>
	<description>
According to the ieee754 standard, positive infinity should be equal to positive infinity (same thing for negative infinity).
This doesn't hold for ND4J, though it's probably due to equalWithEps used internally?
Same result on master + 1.0.0-beta3 - i.e., following test fails.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    @Test
    public void testInfEquality(){
        INDArray withInf = Nd4j.create(new double[]{0,Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY});
        INDArray withInf2 = withInf.dup();
        assertEquals(withInf, withInf2);
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Obviously NaN != NaN according to the standard, so no problems there.
