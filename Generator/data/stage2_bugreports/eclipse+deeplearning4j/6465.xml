	<summary>Libnd4j graph execution failing tests</summary>
	<description>
These were disabled a while ago (when we wanted to get an "all passing baseline") and then forgotten about.
They all pass for SameDiff execution, but not libnd4j execution

		I suspect I'm running into the reductions cases in FB import.
As far as I can tell, the problem with reductions is that the flatbuffers export (and hence libnd4j execution) doesn't have a concept of the keepDims and newFormat args. These 2 args don't impact the shape/length of the buffer, but do impact the shape of the arrays (i.e., there's some extra 1s in the shape).
Edit: stdev/variance biasCorrected arg also looks like it's not being exported.

		Ye, it's a known bug and is a wip.

		Closing this - the majority are now fixed, rest are being worked on.
