	<summary>Method learningRateScoreBasedDecayRate does nothing</summary>
	<description>
NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder method learningRateScoreBasedDecayRate sets parameter lrScoreBasedDecay, but this parameters is not used anywhere.
It looks like method learningRateScoreBasedDecayRate should be either removed or implemented.
