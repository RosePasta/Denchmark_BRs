	<summary>KerasGlobalPooling layer does not allow to set the collapseDimensions flag</summary>
	<description>
The current KerasGlobalPooling class allows only to build a GlobalPoolingLayer with collapseDimensions flag set as true; whether to collapse dimensions should be instead dynamically deduced by the context of the net, i.e. the following layer.

		Thinking about this a little, I don't think keras does dynamic collapsing at all. It will keep dimensions, unless explicitly reshaped. So, I think it might be enough to set collapseDimensions to false (even though dl4j default is true).

 does this reasoning make sense to you or are you aware of any situation in which, for  ,   should indeed be ?

		Currently I am not aware of any situation in which, for model import, collapseDimensions should be true.
I do believe, as you said, that usually keras keeps the dimensions and reshape them in case of need with the following layer.
Thanks for the clarification.
P.S. In case we'll find a particular situation of collapsing dimensions I will inform you.
