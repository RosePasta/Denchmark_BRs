	<summary>libnd4j: reduce_dot_bp is wrong</summary>
	<description>
Dot op: out = sum_i x_i * y_i
Therefore gradient has 3 inputs and 2 outputs.
The reduce_dop_bp implementation (and shape function) only have 1 output

		Dot is Reduce3 reducable op.

		Yes, it is reduce op. But since it takes 2 inputs for multiplication, it should provide 2 gradients. Not 1.

		Should be fixed now i guess.
