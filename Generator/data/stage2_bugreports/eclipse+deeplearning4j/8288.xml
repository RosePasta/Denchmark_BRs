&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please describe our issue, along with:
Running unadulterated Word2VecRawTextExample
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot perform in-place operation "muli": result array shape does not match the broadcast operation output shape: [100].muli([1, 100]) != [100].
In-place operations like x.muli(y) can only be performed when x and y have the same shape, or x and y are broadcastable with x.shape() == broadcastShape(x,y)

		Unfortunately you’ll have to wait couple of days till fix gets into snapshots.

		I am running against 1.0.0-SNAPSHOTs and I keep seeing the same error. Did this make it into the builds yet?

		I'am still having this problem during running the word2vec example code
could you help me?

 if you're running 1.0.0-beta5, that's expected
You'll need to switch to snapshots to get the fix (at least until the next release)
You can find instructions here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/deeplearning4j-config-snapshots&gt;https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/deeplearning4j-config-snapshots&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Or are you on the latest snapshots already?

 I tried to follow the instructions to run on 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT as well. I am facing the same issue. Any help would be great.

 Are you seeing this on Word2VecRawTextExample? Or somewhere else?
The current/latest version of the examples (using 1.0.0-beta6), Word2VecRawTextExample runs without any problems for me (I just checked again now). Make sure to pull the latest version of the examples before trying again.
If it's somewhere else (not that example), then getting that exception it most likely means the error is correct - i.e., the operation isn't valid. For example, trying to add 2 arrays with shapes like [3,4] and [5,6], that can't be done due to the incompatible shapes.
