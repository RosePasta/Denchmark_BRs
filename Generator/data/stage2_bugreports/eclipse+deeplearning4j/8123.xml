	<summary>DL4J/SameDiff warning spam ("Illegal reflective access")</summary>
	<description>
I'm seeing this in some of the DL4J unit tests that have SameDiff layers: (Such as AttentionLayerTests)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.rits.cloning.Cloner (file:/C:/Users/Alex/.m2/repository/uk/com/robust-it/cloning/1.9.3/cloning-1.9.3.jar) to field java.util.TreeSet.m
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of com.rits.cloning.Cloner
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
