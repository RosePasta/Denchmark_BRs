	<summary>cuda Error Launch Failure when dataset too large for memory</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to train with a multidataset that is too big for memory. The logger then says it will use host memory.
Then after a while the process goes zombie with,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CUDA error at C:/Users/josh/dl4j/build/libnd4j/blas/cuda/NativeOps.cu:4851
code=4(cudaErrorLaunchFailure) "result"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is it generally impossible to use CUDA when the data doesn't fit into the memory?
Or can it do part at a time (as it seems to do)?
It seems to fail after about 30 iterations of fit.

		It's not about memory amount.
Show your nn configuration and pom.xml please

 I wonder if this is another CNN fastest algorithm issue? Perhaps trying to use NO_WORKSPACE could work here?

		the model is a simple lstm stack and works with the native backend. Also the cuda backend was working yesterday and the only difference I can think of was that I didnt attach a stats listener UI. Maybe the problem comes from using InMemoryStatsStorage when memory isnt completely on host or device? or is it's location transparent in that process.

		It seems to happen with stats listener ui.

		Surprising. Can you please run with CUDA and without UI stuff? Just to confirm issue is localized to UI?

		I am doing that now.

		So far without the stats UI it's running fine. Now, do you think it depends on whether I use FileStatsStorage or InMemoryStatsStorage? I would imagine that part doesn't make a difference. It must be somewhere an assumption is made where the stats are stored.

		Well, we know that for versions &lt;= 0.8.0 there were no issues with CUDA+UI, besides of excessive GC activity. So it was definitely working. Not sure what was changed in that field on current master :/

 would you know the answer to that?

 can you just try the same code with 0.8.0 from maven central?

		I just had this error without the UI.
It happened after ~10 hours of training. Though during this time my laptop was opened and closed several times by airport staff.

 I'm not exactly sure how to get maven to pull the 0.8 version. I always compile locally. Once I set it in the pom what command should I run to make it download?
UPDATE: nvm I figured it out.

		I ran with 0.8 from maven repo using UI. I get code 4 this time. The same as the original one.
Note that above when I got running without UI and still got the error that it was error 30.

Now, do you think it depends on whether I use FileStatsStorage or InMemoryStatsStorage? I would imagine that part doesn't make a difference. It must be somewhere an assumption is made where the stats are stored.
No INDArrays are stored, and no INDArrays are passed between threads, with the UI.

I'll try to run this later, see if I can reproduce it.

 with regards to the run without UI that also resulted in a crash. I will run again. I suspect it was due to my laptop being open and closed quickly and at random by airport security, because the crash occurs normally within 30minutes of starting and in this case it had been running for 10+ hours no problems until I had to fly. In any case I'll run again without and with my compiled 8.1-snapshot just to be sure.
UPDATE: 8 hours and it's fine. I think it was the rapid opening and closing of the lid
