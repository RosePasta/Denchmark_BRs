		Have you tried to build from source? They are chances that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/libnd4j/pull/207&gt;deeplearning4j/libnd4j#207&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixed this issue.

		Are you talking about OpenBLAS? Should I build OpenBLAS from source?

		<comment id='3' author='rawhazard' date='2016-05-27T11:54:15Z'>
		No, he means building libnd4j and ND4J from source

		<comment id='4' author='rawhazard' date='2016-05-27T12:15:48Z'>
		Can you point me to a guide to do that? Is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/libnd4j/blob/master/windows.md&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 enough for installing BOTH nd4j and libnd4j from source?

		Yes, that should be enough.

 Did you run into any more problems?

		Not so far...apparently compiling rc3.10 SNAPSHOT solved the problem. This is a good guide that may be useful to the case:
