	<summary>Workspace Setting on Computational Graph not working</summary>
	<description>
Using the 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT, when building a computational graph, it is possible to put .workspaceMode before and after .graphBuilder(). Only if it is set before it, the setting will actually stick. I expect it to work in both positions.
