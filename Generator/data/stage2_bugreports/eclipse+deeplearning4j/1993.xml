	<summary>IndexOutOfBoundsException with CUDA half precision</summary>
	<description>
When running my configuration with CUDA default precision, it works. However, when I run it with half precision, I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/andreas-eberle/0992b97fe8062f148344a37f712273ce&gt;https://gist.github.com/andreas-eberle/0992b97fe8062f148344a37f712273ce&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is the configuration I used.

The input I use are 40x40 images with one channel.
