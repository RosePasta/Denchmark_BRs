	<summary>Unit test failure: MultiLayerTest.testBatchNorm</summary>
	<description>
Looks like batch norm (or, perhaps only this test - not sure) is currently broken:
BatchNormalizationParamInitializer.createGamma does a layer.getNOut(), but in that test (and perhaps in general) the batch norm layer has nOut = 0
See also:
BatchNormalizationTest.testCnnShapeBatchNormBack and .testDnnShapeBatchNormBack
