	<summary>OutOfMemoryError ParagraphVectors</summary>
	<description>
Since I switched from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0 I'm getting OutOfMemoryErrors for the same code using Word2Vec on Linux. On Windows it works fine.
Word2Vec Config:

I'm training on the "raw_sentences.txt" from the DL4J Word2Vec examples. Xmx is 3g.

		Could you try just adding more heap space? We haven't done anything significant that would warrant that. We respect Xmx and do our own  memory management.

		Show full source code. Something else has to be wrong.

		Full source code is mostly KNIME stuff, I will try to isolate some code and post it here.

		Ok. Can you please try current master w2v and confirm it's still an issue, because w2v/paravec were migrated to native code recently.

		The current master seems to fix the problem.

		The problem occurred again. This time on Windows, too.
Code to reproduce on Windows:

		Please set .batchSize() to something like 384, and run again

		Choosing a higher batchSize solved the issue for the mentioned configuration, however, I still have some problems. I ran some further tests. When training several ParagraphVector models at the same time for some iteration it eventually throws an OutOfMemoryError.

		Hmm, i've never thought about training w2v/d2v in that way. I should check that.

		Is there any news on this?

		Spent 5 hours running similar code in loop, however without 620MB limitation, no issues.
So i'm tending to say it's not a leak or something, in worst case it's case of higher-then-desired memory footprint. I'll keep investigating in that direction.
