	<summary>Core dump making a copy of a NDArray</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

While creating a new NDArray to replace the params of a Layer with a modified copy the JVM core dumped.
The issue happened calling the constructor of the NDArray with the parameters:
double[] data, int[] shape, int[] stride, long offset
the data were a local copy, the other values were retrieved from the original NDArray (the layer params).
To reproduce the issue just run without extra parameters the main class in the attached project.
In my local tests creating the NDArray from the params of the first layer works, but fails on the second layer.

		99% chance your issue is caused by lack of validation somewhere, and view-based operation.
But to fix it - we need some code that reproduces this problem.

		I launched today the code example attached to this bug with version 1.0.0-beta and the issue was not reproduced.
