Bonjour,
In 4.0 release, method restoreMultiLayerNetwork(InputStream is) in ModelSerializer class is obviously wrong. Starting line 248, you can read:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        while((entry = zipFile.getNextEntry()) != null) {
            switch (entry.getName()) {
                case "configuration.json":
                    DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(zipFile); // &lt;== NO!
                    params = Nd4j.read(dis); // &lt;== NO!
                    gotConfig = true;
                    break;
                case "coefficients.bin":
                    DataInputStream dis2 = new DataInputStream(zipFile);
                    params = Nd4j.read(dis2);
                    gotCoefficients = true;
                    break;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In other words, when processing the zip entry "configuration.json", you actually try to read 'params' value! Based on code of the overloaded method (the one expecting a File argument), I would suggest to use:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;            case "configuration.json":
                BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(zipfile));
                String line = "";
                StringBuilder js = new StringBuilder();
                while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                    js.append(line).append("\n");
                }
                json = js.toString();
                gotConfig = true;
                break;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My advice would be to avoid code duplication between the 3 methods restoreMultiLayerNetwork() which differ on their argument (String vs File vs InputStream) and stick to a single implementation (the one using InputStream) since the 2 other ones could easily delegate to it.
Bye,
