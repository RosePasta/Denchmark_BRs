	<summary>PreTrained VGGFACE appears to be a ComputationGraph</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When trying to use the VGGFACE PretrainedType for Transfer Learning in the SNAPSHOT version, an error occurs because Saved model appears to be a ComputationGraph and the modelType of VGG16 is a MultiLayerNetwork.
This has been changed 1 day ago (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5149&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5149&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
I tried redownloading the PreTrained model from "&lt;denchmark-link:http://blob.deeplearning4j.org/models/vgg16_dl4j_vggface_inference.v1.zip&gt;http://blob.deeplearning4j.org/models/vgg16_dl4j_vggface_inference.v1.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
" but this didn't work since this downloaded model appears to be a 
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

DL4J version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
(Note: on 1.0.0-alpha the modelType is ComputationGraph and that one works fine.)

		Yes, this is definitely the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5148&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5148&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
