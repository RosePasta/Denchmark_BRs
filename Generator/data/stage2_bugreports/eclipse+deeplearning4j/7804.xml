	<summary>Arbiter: EvaluationScoreFunction uses deprecated DL4J Evaluation.Metric (only) not ND4J version</summary>
	<description>
Hello ,
I want to implement the example of BasicHyperparameterOptimization but i have some trouble :
When i use OptimizationConfiguration i have to put an scoreFunction and in the tutorial they create it with ScoreFunction scoreFunction = new EvaluationScoreFunction(Evaluation.Metric.ACCURACY);
The problem is that Evaluation.Metric is Deprecated so i have an error when i use it. They advise to use instead ND4J Evaluation class, which has the same interface but i can't find a way to get a scoreFunction with ND4J.
Can someome help me please ?

		Looks like this got missed when Evaluation was moved to ND4J:

The deeplearning4j Evaluation.Metric should still work fine, and give you exactly the same result as the Nd4j Evaluation.Metric.
Thanks for flagging this, we'll make sure to fix this.
