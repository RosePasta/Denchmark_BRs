	<summary>DL4j BarnesHutTsne Workspace-Panic</summary>
	<description>
I'm using the TSNE-example from the deeplearning4j example project.
I tried using three different inputs:
(1) Text-file with 6k words (Format: one word per line; wordName wordVector)
(2) Text-file with ~18k words (Format: one word per line; wordName wordVector)
(3) Word2Vec-Model containing ~18k words in the vocabulary
For inputs (2) and (3) I get the following exception [full output included]
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/G4mble/a9f35e78fd9499ccf2970269a78e99b6&gt;https://gist.github.com/G4mble/a9f35e78fd9499ccf2970269a78e99b6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Input (1) works fine; no exceptions, output as expected.
The code for input (2) and (3) can be found here [for input (2) the code in lines 42-49 is used; for input (3) the code in lines 51-54 is used]:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/G4mble/5f370e30630ded9737e7bd71e9e6625a&gt;https://gist.github.com/G4mble/5f370e30630ded9737e7bd71e9e6625a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The code already contains part of my attempt to tackle the issue. In line 33 I tried the try-catch solution suggested here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://nd4j.org/userguide#workspaces-panic&gt;https://nd4j.org/userguide#workspaces-panic&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I also tried using ".detach()" on the INDArray in line 54, this did not fix the error.
The pom.xml can be found here:
