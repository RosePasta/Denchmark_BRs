	<summary>Tensorflow model trained in keras and loaded in deeplearning4j is giving NaN as output. Also, the run in Java frequently fails with SIGSEGV.</summary>
	<description>
this is my code
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    ComputationGraph network = KerasModelImport.importKerasModelAndWeights
            ("model.h5", false);

    NativeImageLoader loader = new NativeImageLoader(150, 150, 3);
    INDArray image = loader.asMatrix(new File(Resources.getResource("image.jpg").getFile()));

    INDArray[] output = network.output(false, image);
    System.out.println(output[0]);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the output comes as
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;     [NaN, NaN, NaN]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 we need details if we're going to be able to investigate this. Can you provide the model hdf5 file or at least a model configuration JSON?

		I'm sharing the configuration of model trained in Keras and configuration of model loaded in DeepLearning4J (as ComputationGraph). The .h5 file is too big to be uploaded (180 MB+ after compression). Please let me know if there's something else I need to provide.

		I have uploaded the .h5 file on Google Drive. Link : &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9BCz-ofRaMTVDF6U2dkRmJfUWc&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9BCz-ofRaMTVDF6U2dkRmJfUWc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 got it. Will take a look over next few days. In the meantime, I encourage you to turn on your debugger and step through and see what you can find, as well!

 do you still have this problem?

 I'm trying to reproduce your example, I also do get those SIGSEGV errors frequently.
However the h5 file seems to be corrupted:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;HDF5-DIAG: Error detected in HDF5 (1.10.0-patch1) thread 0:
  #000: H5A.c line 438 in H5Aopen(): unable to load attribute info from object header for attribute: 'weight_names'
    major: Attribute
    minor: Unable to initialize object
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can you maybe provide the python script you're using? I want to see if I can construct a "minimum failing model" (yours is very large).

 also note that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/3597&gt;#3597&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was resolved with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/3842&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/3842&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which might solve your problem as well.
