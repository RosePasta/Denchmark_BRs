	<summary>FileRecordWriter might return wrong value</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
stumbled across this line in 1.0.0-beta3 datavec
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/41f220fbc2410efe71d535f8344f74e11ea8a44a/datavec/datavec-api/src/main/java/org/datavec/api/records/writer/impl/FileRecordWriter.java#L99&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/41f220fbc2410efe71d535f8344f74e11ea8a44a/datavec/datavec-api/src/main/java/org/datavec/api/records/writer/impl/FileRecordWriter.java#L99&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is it possible, that this line should be
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        return PartitionMetaData.builder().numRecordsUpdated(batch.size()).build();
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I would say you're right. Could you send a pull request to have this reviewed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AlexDBlack&gt;@AlexDBlack&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 along with a new unit test that fails without this patch? Thanks!

		Thanks for flagging. But it looks like this was fixed some time ago on master. I've checked other writers too, they seem correct also.
