	<summary>libnd4j: NDArray(*NDArray,...) constructor can be called unexpectedly</summary>
	<description>
It is possible to have the following code:
NDArray foo = bar(); // where bar() returns *NDArray
This will compile without any problems, but it will not do what you expect it to do, as it actually calls a constructor that is meant to create an empty array like the one that is given:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/libnd4j/blas/cpu/NDArray.cpp#L235-L241&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/libnd4j/blas/cpu/NDArray.cpp#L235-L241&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is possible due to that constructor having default values for all of its other parameters.
