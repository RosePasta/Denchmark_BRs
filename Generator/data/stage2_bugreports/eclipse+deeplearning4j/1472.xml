	<summary>RecordReader unit tests failing</summary>
	<description>
Currently the following unit tests are failing:
RecordReaderDataSetIteratorTest

testVariableLengthSequence
testSequenceRecordReaderSingleReader
testSequenceRecordReader

RecordReaderMultiDataSetIteratorTest

testBasic
testVariableLengthTS
testSplittingCSVSequence

Edit: also these tests don't seem to be picking up the input files, when run using "mvn clean test -pl org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-core" (running in intellij works ok though)
