	<summary>Toilet the Reuters News Dataset classes</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The Reuters news dataset is a classic dataset used for testing many algorithms :

We have in our codebase some skeleton classes left out of an attempt to integrate this into our testing datasets (supported by default, like the Iris dataset):

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nlp-parent/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/datasets/loader/ReutersNewsGroupsLoader.java&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nlp-parent/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/datasets/loader/ReutersNewsGroupsLoader.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It's incorrectly labeled "reuters newsgroup" (the reuters news dataset and the 20 newsgroups are 2 distinct datasets, both classics, this is the former).
Those classes should be cleaned up and be brought ini line with the functionality of :
