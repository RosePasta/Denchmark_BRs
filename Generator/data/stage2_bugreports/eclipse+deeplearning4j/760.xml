	<summary>Function did not decrease: score = 1.361 &amp;gt; 1.3460041015625 = oldScore</summary>
	<description>
Using the optimizationAlgorithm : OptimizationAlgorithm.LBFGS this should be a warning rather than an error/exception.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Function did not decrease: score = 1.361 &gt; 1.3460041015625 = oldScore

		Can you show me the configuration you used please? It looks like it went down a maximize code path which shouldn't be the case normally.

		Looking at the line numbers it's probably a case of minimizing objective function but slope (used in Wolfe line search termination condition) being &gt; 0 (which normally shouldn't happen when minimizing objective function)
Would be good to be able to reproduce this and work out why it's happening (might be LBFGS being a little unstable or something)

		I don't think I have the code around anymore. I'll see if I can recreate it.
