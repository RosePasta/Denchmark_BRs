	<summary>libnd4j: matrix_determinant op returning rank 1 shape info instead of scalar</summary>
	<description>
For the case below: should be getting rank 0 shape ([]) instead I'm getting a rank 1 shape [1].
Strange thing is: the logic here looks correct to me, so I don't know how/why it could be returning shape [1] here...

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    @Test
    public void testMatrixDeterminantShapeFunction(){
        INDArray in = Nd4j.create(5,5);
        DynamicCustomOp op = DynamicCustomOp.builder("matrix_determinant")
                .addInputs(in).build();
        List&lt;long[]&gt; outShape = Nd4j.getExecutioner().calculateOutputShape(op);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(outShape.get(0)));

        long[] shapeExp = new long[]{};
        assertArrayEquals(shapeExp, outShape.get(0));
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
