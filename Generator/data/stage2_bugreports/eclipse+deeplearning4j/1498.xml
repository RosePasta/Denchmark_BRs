	<summary>regularization is set to true but l1, l2 or dropout has not been added to configuration. is thrown, when not using regularization</summary>
	<description>
in commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/commit/bbb8d95ae90135b4331eee269a7cb9f07ea62746&gt;bbb8d95&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 a new check was added
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;            if (useRegularization &amp;&amp; (Double.isNaN(l1) &amp;&amp; layer != null &amp;&amp; Double.isNaN(layer.getL1())
                    &amp;&amp; Double.isNaN(l2) &amp;&amp; Double.isNaN(layer.getL2())
                    &amp;&amp; (Double.isNaN(dropOut) || dropOut==0.0) &amp;&amp; (Double.isNaN(layer.getDropOut()) || layer.getDropOut() == 0.0)))
                log.warn(layerName +" regularization is set to true but l1, l2 or dropout has not been added to configuration.");
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

later l1 and l2 will be set to 0 if nan
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;                if (Double.isNaN(l2) &amp;&amp; Double.isNaN(layer.getL2()))
                    layer.setL2(0.0);
                if (Double.isNaN(l1) &amp;&amp; Double.isNaN(layer.getL1()))
                    layer.setL1(0.0);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but since the check is runned twice DenseLayer.Builder.build() and later with listBuilder.build() - when i dont want to use regularization, the first check changes l1+l2 to 0 which causes the second check to fail
