I wonder if DL4J's version of HDF5 is conflicting somehow with Keras's version...

		Appears that way. One of my attempts it also gave me a cryptic error about an infinite loop, but I can't reproduce it.

		Any there any known issues if H5 runs in two separate JVMs? Is there any
file sharing going on?

		i also have such issues before, but after i System.setProperty("org.bytedeco.javacpp.nopointergc","true");
the error gone.
actually i do not know why.

		I don't think it matters if it runs in 2 JVMs, no.
But 2 versions in the same JVM is asking for trouble. As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jasstionzyf&gt;@jasstionzyf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentions, does it happen without GC? It's possible the other version is relying on stuff allocated by our version...
