	<summary>ND4J: Wrong ordering when init with double array, shape and ordering info</summary>
	<description>
The following test case is supposed to pass, but does not.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  @Test
    public void isThisABug(){
        double[] input1 = {1.0, 2.0};
        INDArray in1 = Nd4j.create(input1, new int[]{1, input1.length, 1},'f');
        assertEquals('f',in1.ordering());
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


expected behavior: return 'f' as ordering
encountered behavior: one has to explicitly assign the order after construction again with in1.setOrder('f'), which also can be applied as a workaround, i.e. this way, it passes:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    public void thisWorks(){
        double[] input1 = {1.0, 2.0};
        INDArray in1 = Nd4j.create(input1, new int[]{1, input1.length, 1},'f');
        in1.setOrder('f');
        assertEquals('f',in1.ordering());
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

First want to confirm that it's a bug, can look a bit closer into that, but may need some guidance.

		Obviously that's a bug.

That's the line where Nd4j.order() should be replaced with order
