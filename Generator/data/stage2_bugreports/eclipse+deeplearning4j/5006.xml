	<summary>Unable to import Keras2 model</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Attempted to import these weights, however I'm unsure if our KerasSequentialModel gives us a builder that returns a MultiLayerNetwork

 inspecting this h5 file, I'm fairly certain it is not produced by simply calling  on a keras model. We don't support such custom constructs (how would we?!).
If you can give me a "clean" version of this, we can add this to tests. Closing for now, but make sure to reopen if needed.
