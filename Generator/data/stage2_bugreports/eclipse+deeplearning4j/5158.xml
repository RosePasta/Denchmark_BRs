	<summary>Windows MinGW: open() fails on files &amp;gt; 4GB</summary>
	<description>
We have problem with MMAP on Windows.
open() fails on files larger then 4GB. That's probably MSYS/MinGW issue?
Temporary workaround might be to enforce MAP_ANONYMOUS for Windows systems &amp; length &gt; 4GB?
But that sucks :/
