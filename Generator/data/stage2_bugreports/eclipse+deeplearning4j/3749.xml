	<summary>Setting DataType.Double causes a problem with some layers when using cuda.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Sample code and output: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/wmeddie/42b44e1a8e8427226c579cc852174b79&gt;https://gist.github.com/wmeddie/42b44e1a8e8427226c579cc852174b79&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The above code has two issues, but the first surprising one was that adding Nd4j.setDataType(DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE); causes a ND4JIllegalStateException.
Stack Trace: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/wmeddie/42b44e1a8e8427226c579cc852174b79#file-output-cuda-datatype-double-L299&gt;https://gist.github.com/wmeddie/42b44e1a8e8427226c579cc852174b79#file-output-cuda-datatype-double-L299&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Using the BACKEND_PRIORITY_CPU both float and double versions work (output included)

CUDA 8 CuDNN 6

		I wonder if this is related to nd4j initialization order &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/raver119&gt;@raver119&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?

		99% chance yes.
Move Nd4j.dtype change to first line, so it's called before CUDA backend has it's buffers initialized.
Post update here after that.

		Putting Nd4j.setDataType(DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE); as the first line didn't have any effect.  I also tried putting it in a static initializer as well.
