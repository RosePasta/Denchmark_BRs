	<summary>SameDiff: incomingArgs keys not necessarily unique; overwrites existing values</summary>
	<description>
Consider the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        SameDiff sd = SameDiff.create();

        int nOut = 4;
        int minibatch = 10;
        SDVariable a = sd.var("A", new int[]{minibatch, nOut});
        SDVariable b = sd.var("B", new int[]{minibatch, nOut});

        SDVariable add1 = a.add("add1",b);
        SDVariable add2 = a.add("add2",b);

        SDVariable mul = add1.mul("mul",add2);
        SDVariable sum = sd.sum("sum", mul, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The key {"A","B"} would have appeared multiple times with different values. However, this is not possible:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;private Map&lt;List&lt;String&gt;, DifferentialFunction&gt; incomingArgs;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(Previously this was a  which had its own problems: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5385&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5385&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
