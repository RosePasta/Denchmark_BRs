	<summary>DataSet.shuffle() experiencing Fatal Error</summary>
	<description>
When using the  method on a  object I sometimes get the following error log:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/szingerpeter/ea4d48eeb9861982554db119b312d241&gt;error&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I was able to reproduce the issue with the following code:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/szingerpeter/bdf07a445d12b7b27ba7b354ddb1a91f&gt;code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, I need to run the previous code up to 5 - 10 times consecutively to get to the error.
DL4J: 0.8.0
OS: Ubuntu
Thank you for any help!

		Well, this code is invalid by definition, and shouldn't work.
After DataSets.merge()  you get 2 INDArrays within DataSet with following shapes:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Shape [2, 75, 25, 25, 1, 0, 1, 99];
Shape [2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 99];
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It clearly can't work and shouldn't work, because shuffle for datasets works for dimension 0, and two arrays have different numbers of rows.
So this is input validation issue. This code shouldn't work.
