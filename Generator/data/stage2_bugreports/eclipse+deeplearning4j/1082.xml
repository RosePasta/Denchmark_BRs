	<summary>Wrong DeepAutoEncoder example in documentation</summary>

The example in the documentation is wrong. Since the decoding layer does not use the transposed weights of the encoding layer.
Also there is no performance metric for how well an AutoEncoder is performing. How do you calculate the F1 Score, Precision and Recall.
Is there a correct example of an AutoEncoder anywhere ? I am looking for a simple working Autoencoder. Not a StackedAutoEncoder.

		AutoEncoder code needs to be reviewed

		We currently had Variational AutoEncoder and a DeepAutoEncoder in examples.
This is an old ticket, I assume the issue is addressed, that doc page may need another review, but that is another issue, closing this
