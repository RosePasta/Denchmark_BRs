	<summary>ND4J: Improve Java indexing (INDArray.get()) tests</summary>
	<description>
As part of working on this issue (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/7092&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/7092&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) I found a couple of indexing edge cases (strided intervals on views with offset &gt; 0 sort of thing) here that I suspect would have been problems before I started changing things.
We do have a decent number of indexing tests, but they aren't particularly systematic.
What I think we need here is a systematic series of tests backed by a simple manual indexing implementation to compare against (no views, using getDouble/putScalar, etc).
Edit: and we should add more tests for bad indexing - intervals outside of valid range, for example.
