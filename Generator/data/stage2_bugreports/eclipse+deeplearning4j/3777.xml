	<summary>If paragraph2vec use UNK, it would throws null exception when write paragraph2vec model out.</summary>
	<description>
Just like the title, when use unk to train paragraph2vec, it would throws a null pointer Exception when write it out. follow is config:
paragraphVectors = new ParagraphVectors.Builder()
.minWordFrequency(2)
.learningRate(0.025)
.minLearningRate(0.005)
.batchSize(100)
.epochs(1)
.layerSize(100)
.negativeSample(10)
.iterations(1)//8
.seed(123)
.windowSize(5)
.useUnknown(true)
.iterate(iterator)
.trainWordVectors(true)
.tokenizerFactory(tokenizerFactory)
.build();
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    // Start model training
    paragraphVectors.fit();
    double [] arr = paragraphVectors.getWordVector("UNK");
    WordVectorSerializer.writeParagraphVectors(paragraphVectors,"para2vec08028");
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

UNK could be founded in vocab.
the null pointer exceptions seems happen at encode one of word string to base64.
Thanks for help
