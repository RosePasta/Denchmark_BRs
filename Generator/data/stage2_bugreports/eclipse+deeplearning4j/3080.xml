	<summary>UI overview page: bidirectional LSTM weights not shown</summary>
	<description>
Simple net: b-lstm + global pooling + output layer.
Overview page doesn't show the b-lstm params... my guess: it's filtering "weights only" by "ends with W", which the b-lstm parameters don't end with (they have a B/F suffixes for forwards/backwards).

		Is this issue still relevant?

		Shouldn't be. This was pre-bidirectional wrapper layer (and bidirectional LSTM was deprecated in 1.0.0-alpha)
