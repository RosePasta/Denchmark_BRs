	<summary>TinyImageNetDataSetIterator doesn't validate or correctly use input shapes</summary>
	<description>
The int[] imgDim arg: I had assumed 3,224,224 was valid input. But it's not: it should have been 224,224.
I only realized this much later once I got an obscure shape error during feed forward.
Edit: Even that's not enough... this simple test fails - the shapes are wrong (outputting 64x64 not 224x224 images)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        DataSetIterator iter = new TinyImageNetDataSetIterator(1, new int[]{224,224}, DataSetType.TRAIN, null, 12345);
        DataSet ds = iter.next();

        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1,3,224,224}, ds.getFeatures().shape());
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1,200}, ds.getLabels().shape());
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
