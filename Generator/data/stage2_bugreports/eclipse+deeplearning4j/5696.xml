	<summary>Glove randomly produces NaN weights or nonsensical similarities</summary>
	<description>
Issue Description
In version 1.0.0-beta, there is (still) a bug in org.deeplearning4j.models.glove.Glove that causes it to produce a org.deeplearning4j.models.embeddings.WeightLookupTable with NaN as weights. This can be observed when running org.deeplearning4j.examples.nlp.glove.GloVeExample or any other code that uses dl4j's Glove implementation. Here's some of the logging from the GloVeExample that demonstrates this behaviour:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;09:44:12.864 [VectorCalculationsThread 3] INFO org.deeplearning4j.models.embeddings.learning.impl.elements.GloVe - Processed [47194] pairs, Error was [3.370708701478753E7]

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What is important is that NaN values are not always produced. Sometimes real numbers are produced, sometimes it's NaN.
Another problem is that, even if real numbers are produced, the word similarities are off the mark. E.g.
o.d.e.n.g.GloVeExample - Day/night similarity: 0.06969143450260162
o.d.e.n.g.GloVeExample - Nearest words to 'day': [next, yesterday, a, season, place, one, who, program, best, house]
There are already several tickets relating to this issue, but they have either been closed or pertain to older versions of dl4j cf: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/1622&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/1622&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Therefore as requested by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RobAltena&gt;@RobAltena&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'm creating a new ticket. I've also created a mini-project with a unit-test that runs the  multiple times and fails if any of the weights are NaN. As can be seen, the test fails after a several iterations (or sometimes even the first). If the test doesn't fail upon the first time you run it, please run it several times over. Eventually it will fail.
Please note that changing the org.nd4j.graph.DataType does in no way remedy this problem.
The code can be found in these gists: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/daanvdn/0300c551065fe3fb70b5a1b559069309&gt;GloveRunner&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I've also added it as a github project here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/daanvdn/glove-nan-bug&gt;https://github.com/daanvdn/glove-nan-bug&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thank you! I have send you a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/daanvdn/glove-nan-bug/pull/1&gt;daanvdn/glove-nan-bug#1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to clean up the code a little. Should make it easier to move your junit test into deeplearning4j.

		Closing due to GloVe feature removal. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/7855#issuecomment-624616313&gt;#7855 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
