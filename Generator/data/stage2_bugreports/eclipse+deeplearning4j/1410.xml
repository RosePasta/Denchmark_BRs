	<summary>CNN issues with nOut on first layer</summary>
	<description>

nOut on first layer is throwing sig error when less than 3 in a list format and less than 2 on a CompGraph

		Is this still the case?

		Still an issue under CompGraph and use this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-core/src/test/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/graph/TestCompGraphCNN.java#L205&gt;test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Fixed for list as show in this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-core/src/test/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/multilayer/MultiLayerTest.java#L648&gt;test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		TestCompGraphCNN.testCNNComputationGraphSingleOutFeatureMap() is throwing this exception on my machine:
org.deeplearning4j.nn.conf.inputs.InvalidInputTypeException: Invalid input: activations into layer are h=21 but kernel size is 21 with padding 0
