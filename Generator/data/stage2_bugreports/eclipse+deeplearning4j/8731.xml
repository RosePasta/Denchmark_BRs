	<summary>ImagePreProcessingScaler can not be configured to preprocess labels</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When using ImagePreProcessingScaler for segmentation tasks, both features and labels have to be processed.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/8135&gt;#8135&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has added support for  and , but setting  is a no-op and  still processes only the features.
When the scaler is used as a normalizer for a DataSetIterator this results in labels not being processed correctly when used for segmentation.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
