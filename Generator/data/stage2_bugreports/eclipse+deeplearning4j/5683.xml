	<summary>SameDiff: output arrays are not being re-created when shapes change</summary>
	<description>
I've already fixed this for DynamicCustomOp here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5668&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5668&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, this is also happeninng for TransformOp, and (as far as I can tell from the code) accumulations, index accumulations, etc. - i.e., everything extending BaseOp.
