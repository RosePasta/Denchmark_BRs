	<summary>DL4J - Keras import: detect if File is in JAR and either through useful exception or handle quietly</summary>
	<description>
Unsurprisingly, the HDF5 native libraries can't handle reading Files from within a JAR (unless you use a stream, of course)...

		I don't think KerasModelImport is supposed to support URLs anyway, and since there is no way to specify a file inside a JAR file with just a system file path, I'm not sure this is a bug...

		Ah, I had assumed we were using Java File objects as part of the API, which can handle Files in JARs OK - but apparently not...
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/74bd70162979bace33cf28b160aeb61131e13bcc/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/KerasModelImport.java&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/74bd70162979bace33cf28b160aeb61131e13bcc/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/KerasModelImport.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

So instead, we probably want to have a check at the Java level to see if the file actually actually exists... I'm not seeing that sort of check at present.

		Well, maybe there's a way to pass the messages from exceptions thrown by HDF5. I'll check that up.

		With commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/commit/f463f4ff510d91da07417f9f278e8818c244d48c&gt;bytedeco/javacpp-presets@f463f4f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it's a bit better than "Unknown exception", but not much more, unfortunately:
