	<summary>ND4J: INDArray.get(interval(x,y)) on rank 1 array returns rank 2 array</summary>
	<description>
Increasing the rank of the array doesn't make sense for the 1D input case.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    @Test
    public void testInterval1d(){
        INDArray arr = Nd4j.linspace(1, 10, 10).reshape(10);
        INDArray subset = arr.get(NDArrayIndex.interval(5,10));
        INDArray exp = Nd4j.trueVector(new double[]{6,7,8,9,10});

        assertArrayEquals(new long[]{5}, subset.shape());
        assertEquals(exp, subset);
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note also that the equality is actually passing here too, but I don't think it should - expected has shape [5] but subset has shape [1,5]

		I think we should just update Nd4j code, and retire old logic of 2D vectors/scalars.
