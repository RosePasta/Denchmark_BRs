Doesn't handle the "time series length is undefined" case.
And this doesn't look correct either:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InputType dummyConv = new InputType.InputTypeConvolutional(inputTsLength, inputTsLength, nOut);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 the second part is valid. remember that in our current impl conv1d is a special case of conv2d, so we mock up the input type to use conv2d utils.

		but I recently introduced 1D conv utils, so maybe this could be refactored
