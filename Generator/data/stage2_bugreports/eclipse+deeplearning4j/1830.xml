	<summary>Race condition</summary>
	<description>
AsyncDataSetIterator &amp; AsyncMultiDataSetIterator (since they both share same design) are prone to race condition.
This was confirmed via new added tests, and should be fixed asap, since they are actively used for background prefetching now.

		Fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/1828&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/1828&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

At least multi-iteration tests do not reproduce issue anymore.
