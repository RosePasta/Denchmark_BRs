	<summary>DL4J: Nearest Neighbor test failures</summary>
	<description>
I'm seeing the following tests fail on CPU on current master:
deeplearning4j-nearestneighbor-server

NearestNeighborTest.testNearestNeighbor (expected 1, actual 0)

deeplearning4j-nearestneighbors-core

KMeansTest: Most (all?) tests are crashing JVM
rPUtilsTest.testDistancesComputeBatch

		NearestNeighborTest.testNearestNeighbor - method behavior looks correct to me, so test was corrected and enhanced.

 My understanding of this is that we want the 2 nearest arrays to index 0 - . Obviously an array is always nearest to itself, by definition - but that isn't very useful...

 can you confirm?)

		I've corrected code to exclude target point from resulting array.
