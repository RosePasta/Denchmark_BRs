	<summary>Keras import should get 'scheduled_decay' instead of nonexistant 'decay' for Nadam</summary>
	<description>
DL4J has:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; case "Nadam": {
                double lr = (double) optimizerParameters.get("lr");
                double beta1 = (double) optimizerParameters.get("beta_1");
                double beta2 = (double) optimizerParameters.get("beta_2");
                double epsilon = (double) optimizerParameters.get("epsilon");
--&gt;             double decay = (double) optimizerParameters.get("decay");
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But Keras Nadam has:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def __init__(self,
               lr=0.002,
               beta_1=0.9,
               beta_2=0.999,
               epsilon=None,
--&gt;            schedule_decay=0.004,
               **kwargs):
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This causes an exception in DL4J

 thanks for noticing this. did this change in Keras at some point or was it always like that?

		alright, has always been named like this. I fixed it in a pending PR, will be in snapshots soon.
