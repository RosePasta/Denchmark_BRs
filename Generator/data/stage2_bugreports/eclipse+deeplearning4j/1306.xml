	<summary>Shape mismatch when using batch size &amp;gt; 0 with SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator</summary>
	<description>
When I attempt to use SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator with a batch size above 1, I get the following error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Shapes do not match: x.shape=[100, 100], y.shape=[10, 10, 100]
If I use a batch size of 1, it all works, but the training is erratic as would be expected.

		This has been fixed I think?

		Since this was posted the error handling and exceptions for RecordReaderDataSetIterator and SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator have been given a pass. It hasn't come up since, either.
