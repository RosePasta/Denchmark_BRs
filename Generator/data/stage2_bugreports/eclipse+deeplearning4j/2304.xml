	<summary>Word2Vec getLayerSize() method doesn't return the correct layer size</summary>
	<description>
I loaded the Google word2vec model using model = (Word2Vec) WordVectorSerializer.loadGoogleModel(gModel, true); and then I want to find the layer size by using model.getLayerSize(), but this doesn't return me the correct layer size -- it should be 300, but what it returns is 100.
