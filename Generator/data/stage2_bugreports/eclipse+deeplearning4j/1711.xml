	<summary>Ensure iteration count is persisted when model is saved</summary>
	<description>
The total number of iterations is important for learning rate and momentum schedules.
Currently this is defined in base optimizer; optimizer is not saved when the network is (only config + updaters + params are). Thus, if a model is saved + loaded and training is continued, the number of iterations is reset to zero, messing up the schedules.
Ideally, the iteration count should be defined in something like MultiLayerConfiguration and ComputationGraphConfiguration.

		Note: this is also an issue for Spark training; currently, the iteration count will not be persisted/passed between the workers and driver. Consequently, learning rate/momentum schedules will be reset after each averaging.

		This was fixed a long time ago, but the issue was never closed.
