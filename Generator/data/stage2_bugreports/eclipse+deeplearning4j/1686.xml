	<summary>FileLabelAwareIterator java.io.FileNotFoundException: (Too many open files in system)</summary>
	<description>
I'm getting a FileNotFoundException when using the org.deeplearning4j.text.documentiterator.FileLabelAwareIterator
The issue seems to be that the BufferedReaders are never closed, and Unix systems place a limit on the number of open files that a single process can have. I closed each BufferReader after setting up each LabeledDocument to fix the issue.
