	<summary>Word2Vec: vec.wordsNearest just returns "&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt;" not any other words</summary>
	<description>
Not sure whether it is a bug or i am missing something.
File model = new File("/data/../w2v_models/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz");
Word2Vec vec = WordVectorSerializer.loadGoogleModel(model, true);
Collection wordNearest = vec.wordsNearest("day", 20);
