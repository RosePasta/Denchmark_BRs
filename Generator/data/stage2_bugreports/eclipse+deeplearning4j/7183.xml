	<summary>ND4J: Test failures on master</summary>
	<description>
Previously all ND4J tests were passing (Wednesday/Thursday last week) but now we have a number of failures.
I'm seeing the same failures on two different machines (windows) both built from scratch on current master (not on any branches).
