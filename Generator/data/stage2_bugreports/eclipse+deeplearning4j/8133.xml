	<summary>DL4J: SpaceToBatch layer incorrect gradients</summary>
	<description>
When blocks are &gt; [1,1] the gradient is off by a factor of prod(blocks)
This seems to be due to the fact that SpaceToBatch changes the minibatch size for subsequent layers, including the output layer.
This may just be a problem with the gradient check util, however.
This doesn't look to be a new issue, just our previous tests weren't thorough enough to catch it.

		I'm about 80% sure the op is fine, it's likely just a quirk of DL4J score vs. gradient calculation with non-constant minibatch size
