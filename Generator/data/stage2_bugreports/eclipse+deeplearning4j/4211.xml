	<summary>Tmp files clean-up behaviour</summary>
	<description>
Encountered behavior:
Currently, files like 'restoreXXXXXXXXmultiLayer' and 'paravecXXXXXXXXXXX' which are created by the ModelSerializer and WordVectorSerializer will be deleted after the JVM exits.
Desired behavior:
If you have a very long running loop serializing and deserializing models, this will fill up the tmp dir. I wonder if they could be directly deleted after the model was loaded?

Deeplearning4j version: 0.9.1
platform information (OS, etc): Windows 10

		I believe ModelSerializer was fixed for this a long time ago... can't speak to WordVectorSerializer, however.
