	<summary>Windows CUDA build</summary>
	<description>
We're going to introduce CUDA support for NDArray and all new CustomOps added recently.
However, that brings new problem: linker can't link 500+ objects due to ancient MSDOS limitations.
To be solved.
Old build using nmake/MSBuild:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;NMAKE : fatal error U1095: expanded command line ..... too long
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

New build using ninja:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The command line is too long.
ninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Moving the build directory closer to the root directory should help with that...

		CMake also has a features to list all the objects in a file and pass that to the linker, it should be using that by default. Maybe ninja doesn't support that? Or maybe we need to set CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2015-November/061962.html&gt;https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2015-November/061962.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yes, it is fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/6350&gt;#6350&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
