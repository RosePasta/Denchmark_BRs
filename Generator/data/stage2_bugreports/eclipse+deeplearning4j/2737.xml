	<summary>Activations UI fails for large networks</summary>
	<description>
Visiting the UI activations page at localhost:9000/activations fails when a network is significantly large, such as 4 million parameters. The refresh rate of 3 seconds is too fast because the image isn't finished loading. Also, when the ConvolutionalIterationListener is set to a higher number, refreshing the page too frequently can unnecessarily use up too much memory and cause the associated process to die (as observed below).

		I haven't seen this issue since (and no user reports of it being a problem).
If memory serves me, we implemented subsampling of points and a couple of other backend optimizations since this, which helped?
