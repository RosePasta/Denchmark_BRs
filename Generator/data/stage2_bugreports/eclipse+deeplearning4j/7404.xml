	<summary>ND4J/Libnd4j: LSTM op not being called on CUDA, Crash?</summary>
	<description>
Benchmark: BenchmarkSet4.LSTMBenchmark_DebugTNS
As of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/commit/b791e2f2a1681b3691eac23ce121bc4487a4ba9b&gt;b791e2f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this benchmark crashes (no output/error, just immediate exit of benchmark) on CUDA
As of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/commit/9cf1f5feeb53d2d001814148e9f974f4c86014da&gt;9cf1f5f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the benchmark runs, but the lstmBlock op is definitely not being called on CUDA.
Same benchmark runs fine on CPU on master, obviously.
