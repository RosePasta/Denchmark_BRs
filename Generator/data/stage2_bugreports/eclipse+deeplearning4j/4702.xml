	<summary>IntelliJ build exception</summary>
	<description>
This might be an intellij issue, but it might be related to some of our maven plugins also? I am seeing this frequently on both Windows and Linux, and is quite disruptive. It also seems to result in some occasions on old code/dependencies being used when tests are run.
