	<summary>Bug in PosUimaTokenizer</summary>
	<description>
looks there is a small bug in PosUimaTokenizer in snapshot 3.8 - public PosUimaTokenizer(String tokens,AnalysisEngine engine,Collection allowedPosTags) {
if(engine == null)
PosUimaTokenizer.engine = engine; ... should be PosUimaTokenizer.engine == null in the if condition.. not sure if its fixed in 3.9
