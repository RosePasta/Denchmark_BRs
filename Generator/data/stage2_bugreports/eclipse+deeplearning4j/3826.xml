	<summary>Unable to set UNK in word2vec model</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I load my model from file and want to set the UNK word to something besides the default, but seems to be ignored.
        model = WordVectorSerializer.readWord2VecModel(...);

        model.setUNK("foo");

        System.out.println(model.getUNK());
Still prints "UNK" instead of "foo".

		Well, it's possible to change it, but it doesn't make too much sense tbh. Your UNK word during training becomes average of all unknown words. And simple replacement won't give you equivalent.
But if you want that - change it via VectorsConfiguration bean.

		What if you train a different UNK word from the default one used in DL4J? Thats my use case.

		I've already answered that question, and applied fix as well.
