	<summary>Unit test failure: MultiLayerTest.testGradientUpdate</summary>
	<description>
Specified unit test is failing, after this PR:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/1962&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/1962&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

PR above was necessary - all gradient checks were failing as a result of those removed lines.
