	<summary>CnnSentenceDataSetIterator remove unknown words causes ND4JIllegalStateException</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When the iterator has a sentence where the word vector does not know any of the words and unknownWordHandling is set to removeWord, tokenizeSentence returns an empty array. This then causes the following stack trace:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Exception in thread "main" org.nd4j.linalg.exception.ND4JIllegalStateException: Invalid shape: Requested INDArray shape [1, 0] contains dimension size values &lt; 1 (all dimensions must be 1 or more)

	at org.deeplearning4j.datasets.iterator.AsyncDataSetIterator$IteratorRunnable.run(AsyncDataSetIterator.java:322)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is there a solution to this?

		Not sure, what kind of solution would you expect here. Use other option, not removeWord?

		<comment id='2' author='rj93' date='2017-04-18T06:08:53Z'>
		Right, not solution is possible here for that case.
However, a better exception/error message and maybe the option to skip empty sentences would be good.

		I am also getting same issues with a large sentiment dataset. What would be the solution? any idea?

		Same  org.nd4j.linalg.exception.ND4JIllegalStateException: Invalid shape: Requested INDArray shape [1, 0] contains dimension size values &lt; 1 (all dimensions must be 1 or more)

 Did you get any solution for the same?

		There's configuration for how unknown words should be handled:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nlp-parent/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/iterator/CnnSentenceDataSetIterator.java#L455-L462&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nlp-parent/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/iterator/CnnSentenceDataSetIterator.java#L455-L462&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We still haven't got a good proposal/solution here for what should actually be done in this case, other  than maybe skipping empty sentences.

		For now I have used UseUnknownVector instead of RemoveWord to avoid the error.

		Turns out this was actually fixed some time ago - we have a test for exactly that situation here:
