Hi,
Running the tutorial given on &lt;denchmark-link:http://deeplearning4j.org/image-data-pipeline&gt;http://deeplearning4j.org/image-data-pipeline&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 results in a null pointer exception in 0.4-rc3.9.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException

		I also had this problem, but seems to have been solved by putting -1 instead of 784 (i.e. the nbr pixels) when creating the RecordReaderDataSetIterator.

		This is fixed now from what I understand.

		to put -1 is just a workaround, in my opinion this is not fixed

		"DataSet getDataSet(Collection record)" method in RecordReaderDataSetIterator.java always throws NPE.
the last line in method, "return new DataSet(featureVector, labelIndex &gt;= 0 ? label : featureVector)", label is always null.

		Since the image is now 1 value, we can also use 1 instead of -1. So, what should we put? 1 or -1?

		This has been fixed for a while.
