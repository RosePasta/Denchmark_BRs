	<summary>Restoring a model from the class path of an uberjar fails</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to load a model from the classpath of an uberjar, and I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/util/ModelSerializer.java#L825&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/util/ModelSerializer.java#L825&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is wrong, as the available() method always returns 0 there
Yet if I forcibly fill a BufferedInputStream (via calling the private fill method), if works fine. So this method of checking if data is readable isn't suited for this usecase I think.
That is with current snapshots.

		Fixed here by removing the method for now: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4889&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4889&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
