&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The solution works with beta2 and I was trying to upgrade it to beta4 where core dump is created.
Sample Code - &lt;denchmark-link:https://pastebin.com/T3BxBBWe&gt;https://pastebin.com/T3BxBBWe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After the upgrade, training of the model stops with the exception with stack trace:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/AanjaneyaShukla/e81413c02c4a48cdb9c48f9e93cbf1d5&gt;https://gist.github.com/AanjaneyaShukla/e81413c02c4a48cdb9c48f9e93cbf1d5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information current - 1.0.0-beta4 | old - 1.0.0-beta2&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please indicate relevant versions, including, if relevant:

Deeplearning4j version - beta4
Platform information (OS, etc) -macosx
CUDA version, if used - NA
NVIDIA driver version, if in use - NA

 your source code is kind of useless, since you use pojo there. It gives us 0 information about actual parameters used. Please show actual parameters, tokenizer setup etc.

		We have tried provided settings/corpus and surprisingly were unable to reproduce issue on regular linux machine either with beta4 or current snapshot.
I will try to test on macOS now :/
