	<summary>ComputationGraph does not set last ETL time</summary>
	<description>
By inspecting code and running debugger, it seems like lastEtlTime is never set in ComputationGraph. Quickest way to spot it is probably in debugger, but one noticeable consequence is that PerformanceListener always reports zero ETL time.
Most likely a trivial fix, but feel free to assign it to me in case you have better things to do.
