It only handles float and double, and throws an exception ("Length must be &gt;= 1") for empty arrays.
Note this is used in Nd4j.createFromNpyFile(File)
Edit: Looks like it's hardcoded to return float32 here also, and doesn't check for zeros in shapes to create empty array instead: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/21254a4d5a3584a480fce71fd678e021edc1498f/libnd4j/include/helpers/shape.h#L3671-L3687&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/21254a4d5a3584a480fce71fd678e021edc1498f/libnd4j/include/helpers/shape.h#L3671-L3687&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
