		This is due to the version-changing scripts ( changescalaversions, change spark version), which detect the pom files which have been affected by the versions change in the repo, and from that try to compute which modules should be recompiled.
Sadly, this pom file does not correspond to any module that should be part of the compilation of dl4j.
The fix is to make sure it's not named pom.xml, which is done in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4268#event-1332770775&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4268#event-1332770775&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
