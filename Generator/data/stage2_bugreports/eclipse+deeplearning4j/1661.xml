	<summary>Tutorials not updated</summary>
	<description>
At least one of the tutorials (and javadoc) has not been updated. The restricted boltzmann machine tutorial (&lt;denchmark-link:http://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html&gt;http://deeplearning4j.org/restrictedboltzmannmachine.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) uses the following line of code.
Layer model = LayerFactories.getFactory(conf.getLayer()).create(conf);
There is however no create method that takes only one parameter, even though this is still listed in the javadoc.
