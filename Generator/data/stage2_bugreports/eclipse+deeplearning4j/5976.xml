	<summary>Libnd4j: floormod_bp incorrect</summary>

For z = floormod(x/y), we should have:
dL/dx = dL/dOut = epsNext
and
dL/dy = dL/dOut * floor(x/y)
Keep in mind it's a broadcastable op... so if x or y are broadcast, they need to be summed/reduced.
For example, a x=[3,4,5] and a y=[3,4,1] then "initial" dL/dy (of shape [3,4,5]) has to be summed along dimension 2 (with keepDims=true in this case)
