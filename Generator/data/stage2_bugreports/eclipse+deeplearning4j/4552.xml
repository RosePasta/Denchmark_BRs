	<summary>Model import fails for keras2 model when Merge layer exists</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Importing keras2 model that has a Merge layer fails with NullPointerException.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to import my keras model which has a Merge in its first layer in the Sequential model, however it fails with NPE. Roughly the code is as follows:
model1= ... # A sequential model with some layers in it
model2= ... # Another sequential model with some layers in it
merged = Merge([model1, model2])
final = Sequential()
final.add(merged)
final.add(Dense(1))
final.add(Activation('sigmoid'))
It seems that import code is trying to find the input_shape but since Merge layer does not have one, it returns null when asked and rest of the process fails with NPE. I am attaching the example keras code, model.json and model weights. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/files/1662983/code_and_exported_model.zip&gt;code_and_exported_model.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried the import the model with following code:
MultiLayerNetwork network = KerasModelImport.importKerasSequentialModelAndWeights("model_with_merge.json", "model_with_merge_weights.h5", false);
Here is the relevant stack trace:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.layers.KerasInput.&lt;init&gt;(KerasInput.java:82)
	at org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.layers.KerasInput.&lt;init&gt;(KerasInput.java:62)

	at org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.KerasModelImport.importKerasSequentialModelAndWeights(KerasModelImport.java:218)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Should import the model
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Encountered behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Fails with NullPointerException because of input_shape detection mechanism.

 thanks for reporting, that's indeed a problem. For now you could use the functional API, i.e. something like &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/emc5ud/3fd5d22a63bc65e918083a3eff3fdcad&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which does work.

 Thanks for help and example. I will try it.

 just a quick update on this: it's more complicated then anticipated.  has been deprecated for a long time and removed by now.  holds two complete  models in its  config, which we have to recursively read and make sense of.
It's much easier to map this with the functional API. I'll get back to this at one point, but it will take more itme.

		I think I've managed to import Keras model after using functional API as you suggested. Therefore this is not a blocking issue for us. I can close it if you also prefer so, since as you said, merge is deprecated.
Thanks.

 sure, I think that makes sense. thanks for providing feedback!
