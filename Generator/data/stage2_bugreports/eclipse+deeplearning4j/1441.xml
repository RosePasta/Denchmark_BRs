	<summary>MultiLayerNetwork.numParams(): NPE if net has not been initialized</summary>
	<description>
calling MultiLayerNetwork.numParams() before .init() gives a null pointer exception.
Also: the javadoc is inaccurate; should say that it returns the number of parameters (including biases) for the network.
