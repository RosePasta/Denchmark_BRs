	<summary>Gracefully handle WordVectorsImpl.getWordVectors given List of no known words</summary>
	<description>
This loop below in the implementation of getWordVectors below potentially empties the entire indexes array. If so, passing it to Nd4j.pullRows will cause an IllegalStateException to be thrown. The user has no mechanism to determine if this will happen other than a try/catch. Is there a more graceful way to handle this? Would it be possible to return an INDArray filled with the vectors for UNK?
while(ArrayUtils.contains(indexes, -1)) {
    indexes = ArrayUtils.removeElement(indexes, -1);
}
