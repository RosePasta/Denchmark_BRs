		This seems rather random: Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/snappy-1.1.2-edc3f43a-0653-4131-9f66-3396e19c5043-libsnappyjava.so: /tmp/snappy-1.1.2-edc3f43a-0653-4131-9f66-3396e19c5043-libsnappyjava.so: failed to map segment from shared object: Operation not permitted
This looks to be possibly permissions related? Are you sure this isn't just a CI hiccup?

 Looks like an issue related to Docker: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/1339&gt;docker/compose#1339&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 See, this looks like another case of one more guy reinventing the wheel, trying to make another native loader as with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/pull/83&gt;javafxports/openjdk-jfx#83&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, instead of cooperating together to come up when a solution that works well!

, right, as I said above, I didn't noticed that, and once Adam point me that line in log, I did some fixes in CI scripts, but it didn't help... Will proceed with debugging...
