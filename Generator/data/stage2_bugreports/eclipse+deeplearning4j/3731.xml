	<summary>CUDA + LSTM implementation + workspaces - exception on character example</summary>
	<description>
Take the character example, switch to LSTM layer (from GravesLSTM), set WorkspaceMode.Single for both and we get the following exception:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/79265da24e82b43b0cf895db2648fcca&gt;https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/79265da24e82b43b0cf895db2648fcca&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Note that GravesLSTM, which shares most of the code with LSTM, is fine.
I'm assuming this is workspace related (array/s being leaked outside of scope) but I can't see any differences between GravesLSTM and LSTM that would explain it...
