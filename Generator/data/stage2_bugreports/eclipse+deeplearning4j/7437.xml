	<summary>DL4J: MultiLayerNetwork/CompGraph rnnGetPreviousState + wrapper layers</summary>
	<description>
Wrapper layers like LastTimeStep and FrozenLayer aren't Recurrent layers, so they can't return the previous state in the current implementation - even though it exists and we could return it...
