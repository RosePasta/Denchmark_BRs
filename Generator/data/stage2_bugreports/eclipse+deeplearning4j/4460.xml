	<summary>ROC.merge() fails with "mismatched lengths" error for large data sets</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 fails for larger data sets with a "mismatched lengths" ND4J error. This could easily arise when, e.g., doing distributed training of a binary classifier with a large training data set on Spark. The culprint is a call to NDArray.assign on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/ROC.java#L672&gt;line 672&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;newProbAndLabel.assign(probAndLabel.get(NDArrayIndex.interval(0, exampleCount), NDArrayIndex.all()));
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

when  and  are not equal. You can replicate the error by tweaking the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-core/src/test/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/ROCTest.java#L856&gt;testROCMerge&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 class in the ROC unit tests. See comments below for details.
