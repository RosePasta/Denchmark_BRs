	<summary>SVHN fetcher URL is timing out</summary>
	<description>
Currently timing out for me and at least one other user:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/988630b1c8cde8da6414ca80d146097c902993fb/deeplearning4j-data/deeplearning4j-datasets/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/datasets/fetchers/SvhnDataFetcher.java#L49&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/988630b1c8cde8da6414ca80d146097c902993fb/deeplearning4j-data/deeplearning4j-datasets/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/datasets/fetchers/SvhnDataFetcher.java#L49&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

No idea if this is permanent or temporary.
Either way: if we can, we should host this dataset on a web server that we control.

		Looks like this was just temporary - perhaps for now we'll leave it as-is and review if it happens again.
