	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I get "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" error when I try to use MultiDataSetIterator in a ComputationGraph having 2 output classifier. Here is a link to the code:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/443a21f21204b5e6a88b9869a45994f3&gt;https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/443a21f21204b5e6a88b9869a45994f3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is my pom file: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/5d96a5309acf7e52d812fdcde9b69b71&gt;https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/5d96a5309acf7e52d812fdcde9b69b71&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

OS: Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
Config: 16 vcpus, 64 GB memory
This is the error, which I get:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/bd14f194c0785bdd0c07a54c01877563&gt;https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/bd14f194c0785bdd0c07a54c01877563&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here is a link to the /home/hadi/jarFiles/hs_err_pid46365.log:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/ece4910059a400e619c823334fc26bbd&gt;https://gist.github.com/Hadi-H/ece4910059a400e619c823334fc26bbd&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Any help is very appreciated.

		Closing as outdated - we haven't had reports of this since, and there has been a ton of workspace-related fixes since 0.9.1 (which is by far the most likely candidate for these sorts of crashes).
