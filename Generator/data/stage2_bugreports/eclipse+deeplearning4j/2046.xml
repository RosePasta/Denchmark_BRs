	<summary>ModelSerializer.writeModel(Model, OutputStream, boolean) closes stream despite not opening it</summary>
	<description>
Methods should not close streams that they have not opened themselves. ModelSerializer.writeModel(Model, OutputStream, boolean) closes the passed outputstream - this e.g. hinders writing the model to a ZIP file.
A possible workaround is to wrap the passed outputstream using a CloseShieldOutputStream.

		Actually that looks like the only viable solution, since it's ZipOutputStream who actually passes close() to underlying stream.
