	<summary>feedForward produces non-deterministic output in inference mode.</summary>
	<description>
I've encountered some issues with non-deterministic results from feedForward( inputs, false).
The computation graph consists of several inputs, but the problem seems to be with the text -&gt; embedding -&gt; rnn flow.
I'll describe two scenarios below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;GIVEN&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

a computation graph
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;WHEN&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

input is in c order
and feedForward is called
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;THEN&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Somehow the text input array is corrupted with indices out of range.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: Index can't be &lt; 0 and &gt;= 40000
	at org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j.pullRows(Nd4j.java:5693)
	at org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j.pullRows(Nd4j.java:5666)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that this does not occur every time.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;EXPECTED&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Inputs should work in both c and f mode.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;GIVEN&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A computation graph
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;WHEN&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Input is in f order
and feedForward is called
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;THEN&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Result from first call is different to result to subsequent calls
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;EXPECTED&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

feedForward is deterministic.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Code&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The minimal code to reproduce the problem is here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mboyanov/dl4j-problem-reproduce&gt;https://github.com/mboyanov/dl4j-problem-reproduce&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please indicate relevant versions, including, if relevant:

Deeplearning4j version 0.9.1
platform information (OS, etc) Ubuntu 16.04
Nd4j native backend

		Thanks for the issue and the project (which helped a lot to quickly reproduce and fix this issue).
Fixed here, will be merged soon: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4349&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4349&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks :) Keep up the good work!
I'm guessing it will be merged into master and I'll have to build from source?

		Yeah, will be merged after review. Snapshots are currently broken, so building from source is your only option (well, other than waiting for the next release - which we are working towards, but still could be a couple of weeks in the worst case).

		Sounds good, should I close this or does it stay open until merge?
