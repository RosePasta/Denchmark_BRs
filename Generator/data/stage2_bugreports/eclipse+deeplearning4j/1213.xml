	<summary>normalizeZeroMeanZeroUnitVariance doesn't export mapping</summary>
	<description>
As a practical matter, you need to be able to repeat the exact same mapping during testing. So if this function exists, shouldn't it export a mapping? And possibly include an inverse function to apply the mapping to data.

		Specifically for standard normalization approaches the best way would be using InputPreProcessors configured within your model. So, in this way model persistence guarantees persistence of your InputPreprocessors as well.
