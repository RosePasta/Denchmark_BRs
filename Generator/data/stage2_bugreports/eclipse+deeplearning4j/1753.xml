	<summary>Defunct code in word2vec example</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec#just&gt;http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec#just&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 under "Tokenizing the Data" there's an 'if' branch which prints a newline if a token ends in 'ly' or 'ing' - What's the reason for that? Some sort of not quite completed warning logging (if those endings were expected to be removed)? Or is there something I'm missing...
Checked in chat, and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/raver119&gt;@raver119&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested it was very likely just defunct code which should be removed.
