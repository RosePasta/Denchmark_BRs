	<summary>ND4J: CUDA + Spark dependency conflict</summary>
	<description>
CUDA on Spark can do this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/lang3/ThreadUtils
	at org.nd4j.jita.concurrency.CudaAffinityManager.getNextDevice(CudaAffinityManager.java:184)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Full stack trace:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/716a76014e3248e8142475f9b19a687b&gt;https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/716a76014e3248e8142475f9b19a687b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

ThreadUtils was added in commons lang 3 version 3.5.
Looking at dependency tree:
Spark 1.6.3 pulls in Hadoop 2.2.0 which pulls in commons-lang3 3.3.2
When we don't control the classpath (i.e., spark submit) we can get that exception.
Spark 2.4.2 uses commons-lang3 3.5, but that doesn't really matter as long as we still support Spark 1...

 Any recommendations?

		Looks like we only use findThreadById() from that though, doesn't look like a big issue...

		It's pure cosmetic use, and in most of cases it'll be Thread.currentThread(). Fix merged.
