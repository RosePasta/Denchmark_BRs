	<summary>Model updater saved with 0.4.0 cannot be loaded with 0.5.0</summary>
	<description>
Got the following exception when loading a model trained and saved with DL4J 0.4.0 using 0.5.0. It seems that org.deeplearning4j.nn.updater.MultiLayerUpdater does not hard-code serialVersionUID. As a result, any change to the class, even compatible changes such as adding a method or field, will break loading of updaters saved with an earlier version of the class.
Exception in thread "main" java.io.InvalidClassException: org.deeplearning4j.nn.updater.MultiLayerUpdater; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 5140445576767494002, local class serialVersionUID = 7792279892583822027

		It's a known bug, sorry.
There's workaround available for this issue:

Open your saved model file as ZIP file
remove updater
Save back zipped model
Model will be able to restore.
