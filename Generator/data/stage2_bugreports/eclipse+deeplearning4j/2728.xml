	<summary>Null TestSetRegressionScore using arbiter</summary>

###Error###
INFO  [2017-01-23 21:26:24,538] org.deeplearning4j.arbiter.optimize.runner.BaseOptimizationRunner: Completed task 0, score = null
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

###GIST showing where the problem occurs###
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/edb2016/79b60a9dbc61e869b712e63920c85644&gt;https://gist.github.com/edb2016/79b60a9dbc61e869b712e63920c85644&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But basically the candidate.getDataParameters() returns null and hence the score is null.

		Here is a GIST of the dataset iterators that I used to point to CSV files along with the data provider.

		Hi I have been doing some investigation and it looks as though its null because an exception is thrown in the next.getLabels().columns() method passed in the constructor . Its expecting 2d but my data is 3d. Please see code snippet.

		As above I've done some research myself as to why my next.getLabels() is returning a 3d array and not 2d.


I'm using CSVSequenceRecordReader &amp; SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator to read my CSV files. I can see the BaseNDArray init method being called and setting the rank to 2. However if I look at my DatasetIterator, call next().getLables() it returns and NDArray with rank 3. I have no idea how or why this is happening


I can also confirm the SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator-&gt;nextMultipleSequenceReaders method is creating a INDArray for labels with dimensions of 2d


So given the above two points I don't understand how it can return a rank of 3??

 I think I've isolated the problem: the fix is relatively simple (and you should be able to utilize it without having to build from source)
Can you copy the following code into your own project, and use it in place of the existing (built-in) TestSetRegressionScoreFunction?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/Arbiter/blob/b6a1c5864aba88c5e8476006be947f8fa94c5a2b/arbiter-deeplearning4j/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/arbiter/scoring/multilayer/TestSetRegressionScoreFunction.java&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/Arbiter/blob/b6a1c5864aba88c5e8476006be947f8fa94c5a2b/arbiter-deeplearning4j/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/arbiter/scoring/multilayer/TestSetRegressionScoreFunction.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

That is taken from the following pull request: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/Arbiter/pull/56&gt;deeplearning4j/Arbiter#56&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It should fix it, but let me know how that goes.
