	<summary>Add input validation for MultiLayerConfiguration</summary>
	<description>
Currently: there is no validation for configurations that are likely to be incorrect.
For example:

.momentum(x) without Nesterovs updater
.useDropConnect(true) without a .momentum(y)
pretrain with only dense layers + output layer
etc
