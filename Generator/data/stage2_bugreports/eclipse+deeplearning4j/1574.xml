	<description>
I am doing multivariate regression and trying to load data with CSVRecordReader, but I got some index error. Here the code I am using with attached the csv data file I am trying to read:

		I ran this without issue on both 3.9 and 3.10-SNAPSHOT. Closing this.
Code below runs without issue:
    public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception {
        int numLinesToSkip = 0;
        String delimiter = " ";
        RecordReader recordReader = new CSVRecordReader(numLinesToSkip, delimiter);
        recordReader.initialize(new FileSplit(new File("C:/Temp/rrdsi/data.txt")));

        int labelIndexFrom = 4875;
        int labelIndexTo = 4889;
        int batchSize = 1;

        DataSetIterator iter = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(recordReader, batchSize, labelIndexFrom, labelIndexTo, true);

        while(iter.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(iter.next());
        }
    }
