	<summary>ParagraphVectors inferVector does not return vectors</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to infer the vector for a new document using a trained paragraph vector model, but the infer method does not give me the vector, I checked in function
public INDArray inferVector(List document, double learningRate, double minLearningRate, int iterations)
returns null;
and the new document label is randomly generated, and not included in the vocabulary
How can I get the vector for a new document using inferVector method?
Thanks

		I'm sorry, but inferVector meant to be protected for now. Implementation wasn't finished yet, and will be available in next release.

		To infer a vector for a new document given a trained model is a key functionality that will boost the api usage.

 do you have an approximate date for the next release?

		Sorry, right now main priority is CUDA performance &amp; multi-gpu scaling. After it's finished - i'll get back to NLP.
p.s. and fp16 support...

		Implemented. Example is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/pull/234&gt;eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples#234&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Will be merged soonâ„¢ and will be available with 0.6.0 release next week.
