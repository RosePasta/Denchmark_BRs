Will support be addded ? I'm using SNAPSHOTS and its able to convert the model but not read it again -
Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: org.nd4j.shade.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: No suitable constructor found for type [simple type, class org.deeplearning4j.nn.conf.layers.util.MaskZeroLayer]: can not instantiate from JSON object (missing default constructor or creator, or perhaps need to add/enable type information?)

		@Anriod I'll try to reproduce this and fix it soon.
I only became aware of it as an issue just now.

		Reproduced and fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/7415&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/7415&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

That PR should be merged soon; the fix will be available on snapshots after that.

		It wasn't there a day or two back I think, but I got the latest SNAPSHOTS just now and it's fixed. Thanks!
