	<summary>CenterLossOutputLayer defaults are not valid</summary>
	<description>
CenterLossOutput layer has sigmoid as default activation and multiclass cross entropy as default loss and those two are not compatible according to new validation rules in beta3.
No biggie perhaps, but shouldn't take long to fix either.
Testcase:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;@Test
public void centerlossDefaults() {
    new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder()
            .graphBuilder()
            .addInputs("input")
            .setOutputs("output")
            .addLayer("0", new DenseLayer.Builder().nOut(3).build(),"input" )
            .addLayer("output", new CenterLossOutputLayer.Builder().nOut(3).build(), "0")
            .build();
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		IIRC this might impact some of the other output layers too.
This should be checked across the board, though I kind of the like the idea of users getting an exception if they just use the defaults for something as important as the output layer (as it's not always obvious what the defaults are, and even good defaults are totally unsuitable for some tasks - like regression).
