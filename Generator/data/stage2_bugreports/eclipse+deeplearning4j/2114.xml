	<summary>GPU is not being fully utilized</summary>
	<description>
System Information:
nd4j-backend: nd4j-cuda-0.8.0
GPU Hardware: GTX 1070
Driver Version: 372.70
OS: Windows 7 64 bit
Java: 1.8.0_102-b14
Example Program:
The
java -cp target/classes;target/ComputerVision-examples-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.deeplearning4j.examples.cv.cifar10.Cifar
GPU Load Monitoring using GPU-Z:
The GPU load on average is about 20%.
When using the nd4j-native backend running on CPU, the CPU load average (using task manager) is about 50%.
When running the LFW example using the "nd4j-cuda-0.8.0" backend
java -cp target/classes;target/ComputerVision-examples-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.deeplearning4j.examples.cv.labeledFacesWild.LFW
The GPU load average is only about 10%.
The question is that, why dl4j is not taking the full computing capabilities of a local GPU?

		That's wrong question.
Proper question is: what PerformanceListener shows your for both CPU and GPU?
