	<summary>DL4J: EmbeddingSequenceLayer: no gradient checks, mask support wrong</summary>
	<description>
When using mask arrays with EmbeddingSequenceLayer:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mismatched shapes (shape = [3, 4, 6], column vector shape =[3, 6])
	at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.doColumnWise(BaseNDArray.java:2827)
	at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.muliColumnVector(BaseNDArray.java:3314)
	at org.deeplearning4j.nn.layers.feedforward.embedding.EmbeddingSequenceLayer.activate(EmbeddingSequenceLayer.java:158)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also - I found out that there were no gradient checks for this layer :(
