	<summary>Errors in running GloveExample in DL4J-examples</summary>
	<description>
I didn't change anything and just run the default example, but received this error message. What might be the problem?

		I've found that reducing the learning rate to about 0.01 can get rid of the NaNs but not the NullPointerExceptions.

		Closing due to GloVe feature removal. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/7855#issuecomment-624616313&gt;#7855 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
