	<summary>FrozenLayers are not frozen after being saved + restored by ModelSerializer</summary>
	<description>
Essentially the same issue as here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3351&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3351&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

ModelSerializer saves the JSON and params separately, then re-creates them. The JSON does not store/represent the fact that the layers are frozen, however; consequently, the layers are unfrozen once they are restored from JSON.
