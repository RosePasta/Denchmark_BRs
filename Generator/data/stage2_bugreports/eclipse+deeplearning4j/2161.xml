	<summary>DL4j/ND4j unstable on Mac</summary>
	<description>
It looks like silent stack corruption happens somewhere with nd4j-native. To be fixed asap.

		If I remember correctly there were people who said that they have that problem with Apple's BLAS implementation but not with OpenBLAS. Not sure if that is a related problem, but wanted to mention it anyway.

		I think that's another issue, it's reproducible for Susan only with 0.6.1

 Does it happen with both OpenBLAS and Accelerate (Apple's default BLAS that gets used by CMake if OpenBLAS isn't installed)?

		It's reproducible for me on Mac too, just confirmed it. Running without
OpenBLAS

		I can provide crash logs, sure, but two crashes i've been able to reproduce,happened in different places within nd4j-tests, with different info in dump.

		Right, that's not blas-related. At least one of +- reproducible tests sets causing crash is this one:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/9b8539acec5d332d11f255c4bfac56a3db083c8e/nd4j-backends/nd4j-tests/src/test/java/org/nd4j/linalg/api/ndarray/TestSerializationFloatToDouble.java&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/blob/9b8539acec5d332d11f255c4bfac56a3db083c8e/nd4j-backends/nd4j-tests/src/test/java/org/nd4j/linalg/api/ndarray/TestSerializationFloatToDouble.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In this case crash looks like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;15:33:37,561 INFO  ~ Running org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.TestSerializationFloatToDouble on backend org.nd4j.linalg.cpu.nativecpu.CpuBackend

		The problem is probably there on Linux as well, just not causing a crash. Running that through Valgrind is probably a good idea.

		Yep, agreed.

		Issue seems to be fixed now. Neither originally localized tests or "Run All Tests" causing crash anymore.

		... for me. But still crashing for Susan.

		False flag. Issue is fixed for Susan as well.

		I am seeing this issue when running spark locally, just in the last day. It didn't happen in the past, and I am wondering if there is something I can do to address the problem? I am also running on a mac as well.
