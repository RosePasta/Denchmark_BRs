		Please run without CUDA and confirm that's the issue on CPU as well.
There's no CUDA kernel for upsampling right now anyway, so CPU is used for this op

		Max has nothing to do here. As i see - CUDA backend crashes in CustomOp helper.

		And it looks like windows-specific issue again. Just checked linux - no issues here.
