Changes to DynamicCustomOp introduced in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/5668&gt;#5668&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Most of these are fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5737&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5737&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Remaining failures I'm seeing are documented in more detail here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5738&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/5738&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
