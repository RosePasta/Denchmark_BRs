	<summary>ND4J: Can't do muliColumnVector with 1D inputs</summary>
	<description>
[3,4].muliColumnVector([3]) gives exception.
We should support this 1d case IMO.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mismatched shapes (shape = [3, 4], column vector shape =[3])

	at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.muliColumnVector(BaseNDArray.java:3293)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
