	<summary>eval() needs to use Async iterator, workspaces</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When calling .eval() on a model, it neither uses the workspaces config nor AsyncDataSetIterator. Not only does this inhibit performance, but it also creates a memory leak since data in async iterator does not use workspaces.
When using long-running training w/ GC disabled, eval() will crash a large training instance.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please indicate relevant versions, including, if relevant:

Deeplearning4j MASTER
Ubuntu 16.04
CUDA 8, cuDNN 6
NVIDIA driver 378

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Contributing&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I can probably take a stab at this and follow the same conventions used in fit() for async wrapping.
