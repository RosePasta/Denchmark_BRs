	<summary>DL4J: Check for array casts to default floating point type</summary>
	<description>
There's a few statements like these in some of the DL4J layers: x.castTo(Nd4j.defaultFloatingPointType()).
This isn't really safe - the casting behaviour should depend on the network datatype (i.e., datatype of parameters) not whatever the default currently is.
For example, some other thread could change the default floating point type, and suddenly your network starts throwing datatype exceptions...
