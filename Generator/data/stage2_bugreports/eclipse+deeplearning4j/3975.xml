	<summary>Gradient check edge cases found for certain padding configurations</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When adding ZeroPadding1D layers, we noticed that in CNN1DGradientCheckTest test, if we replace SIGMOID by TANH, a few (about 4 out of 100) of the tests will fail.
After consulting with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AlexDBlack&gt;@AlexDBlack&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we might have hit an edge case somewhere in the underlying code. Need to further investigate this.

		Confirmed fixed - passes with TANH now too for that test.
