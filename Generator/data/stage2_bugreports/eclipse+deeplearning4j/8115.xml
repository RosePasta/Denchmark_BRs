	<summary>DL4J: JVM crash in YoloGradientCheckTests.testYoloOutputLayer (CPU)</summary>
	<description>
This is fairly recent - I was not seeing this crash around 12-14 hours ago.
JVM crashes in random locations in YOLO tests - on CPU
both the location and type of failure is inconsistent
Different failures for same test:

Process finished with exit code -1073740940 (0xC0000374)
JVM crash in shape creation? https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/5ff6df2c9a569c01fe7dc1d1ebfda52f
Bad datatype? https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/25e40a8f92287006cb84bd844d038f18

Stack corruption? Shape info corruption?
It's not workspace related, same crashes with workspaces disabled.

		To make this more interesting: it's CPU specific.
This gradient check actually passes on CUDA on current master...

		Confirmed fixed today after IsMax fixes were merged.
