	<summary>MultipleEpochsIterator doesn't behave like a for-loop of reset and fit</summary>
	<description>
They're behavior are not equivalent.
I believe the issue is here
public boolean hasNext() { return iter.hasNext() &amp;&amp; passes &lt; numPasses; }
when the iter is empty but passes &lt; numPasses, the MEI still have a the next passes and hasNext should not return false.

		Right, there should be || instead of &amp;&amp;.
That's fixed, and will be merged a bit later.
