	<summary>Suspected bug in Barnes-Hut-SNE implementation</summary>
	<description>
I recently tried to visualize some  embeddings and got &lt;denchmark-link:https://i.imgur.com/IzuN6kc.png&gt;pretty terrible results&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 using the default &lt;denchmark-link:https://deeplearning4j.org/doc/org/deeplearning4j/plot/BarnesHutTsne.html&gt;BarnesHutTsne&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 implementation. Performance was poor across multiple different parameter settings, so optimization there didn't really help. I'm not 100% sure where the problem is or whether this generalizes to other types of data, but I just wanted to raise a flag.
Setting theta=0.0 fixed this problem because apparently there is a special case implemented for this that results in just regular t-SNE (decomposedTsne) being used within BarnesHutTsne. This should be documented more explicitly. I also found that decomposedTsne ran an order of magnitude faster than BarnesHutTsne, which is the opposite of how it should be.

		I also got incorrect results using BarnesHutTsne with sample data from dl4j-examples/src/main/resources/raw_sentences.txt. The closest words to "day" are  according to Word2Vec's , but &lt;denchmark-link:https://imgur.com/a/gpLD5sy&gt;BarnesHutTsne plots "day" and "week" far apart&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on opposite quadrants.
When I set theta=0.0, using the default TSNEStandardExample.java with only theta changed, I get the following exception:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't transpose array with rank &lt; 2: array shape [140]

		Unfortunately, with theta = 0.0, there's old TSNE executed.

		Also, BarnesHutTsne was overhauled recently to match reference implementation, however there was no release yet.

 can you please file new issue about original (non-BarnesHutTsne) please?
