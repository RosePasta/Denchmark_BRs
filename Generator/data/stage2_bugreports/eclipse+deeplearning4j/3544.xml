	<summary>RNG seeds should be set just before init</summary>
	<description>
Currently RNG seeds are set when the configuration is created:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/NeuralNetConfiguration.java#L728-L732&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/NeuralNetConfiguration.java#L728-L732&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, this won't work for some use cases:

JSON with seed -&gt; disk -&gt; load later -&gt; initialize network
Config with seed -&gt; create first net -&gt; create second net -&gt; params differ but shouldn't

Instead, RNG seeds should be set during network initialization.
