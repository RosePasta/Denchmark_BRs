	<summary>Fix JSON serialization of custom preprocessors</summary>
	<description>

 on gitter: " I did this and implemented a custom InputPreProcessor called HeightToTimePreProcessor to glue the last cnn layer to the first rnn layer. I integrated it into a ComputationGraph. I fit the model and saved it. When I try to load it back into memory using ModelSerializer.restoreComputationGraph I get java.lang.RuntimeException: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Could not resolve type id 'HeightToTimePreProcessor' into a subtype of [simple type, class org.deeplearning4j.nn.conf.InputPreProcessor]: known type ids = [InputPreProcessor, binomialSampling, cnnToFeedForward, cnnToRnn, composableInput, feedForwardToCnn, feedForwardToRnn, reshape, rnnToCnn, rnnToFeedForward, unitVariance, zeroMean, zeroMeanAndUnitVariance]"
JSON subtypes need to be registered with Jackson object mapper manually, probably using reflection as per custom layers etc.
