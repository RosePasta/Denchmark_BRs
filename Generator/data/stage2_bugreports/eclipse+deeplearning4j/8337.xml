	<summary>SameDiff CUDA test failures (Java level memory management)</summary>
	<description>
Many of the TF import tests when run on CUDA are giving this exception:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: Attempting to release an array that was not allocated by this memory manager: id=45
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The same tests run on CPU are fine
