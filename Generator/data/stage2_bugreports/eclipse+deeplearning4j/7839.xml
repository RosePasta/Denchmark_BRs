	<summary>one-row or one-column matrix not accepted as matrix</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have NDArray matrix of dimensions n x 100, where n may have values 1...100.
Attempt to call toFloatMatrix() fails with exception

  org.nd4j.linalg.exception.ND4JIllegalStateException: Unable to create a 2d array from a non matrix! Shape: FLOAT,[1,100],c


when n=1, but works for all other matrix dimensions.
My expectation is that any of n=1...100 would be acceptable dimension for matrix.
From source it seems that isMatrix has (unexpected) requirement that neither of matrix dimensions must be 1. Still one-row or one-column matrix is common case.
Note that functions rows() and columns() have special handling, that allows them to get rows or columns of one-row or one-column matrix.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


current git version.
