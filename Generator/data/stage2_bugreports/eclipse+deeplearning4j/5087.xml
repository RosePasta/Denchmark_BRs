	<summary>Remove all uses of Eclipse Collections</summary>
	<description>
This library does not work with Android and should be removed.
DataVec is handled here (see also for discussion): &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/DataVec/pull/575&gt;deeplearning4j/DataVec#575&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We have other uses in DL4J (UI) and Arbiter, mainly for the primitive collections. Either we switch those to another implementation, or we look at implementing some in nd4j-common.
