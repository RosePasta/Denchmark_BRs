	<summary>Nd4j/Libnd4j: CI issue with TF import argmax test</summary>
	<description>
Test: "reductions/argmax3,4,5_-1" - passes locally on both of my machines (Windows 10, Kubunu 17.10). However is failing (timing out, 10 seconds - it should take &lt;&lt;10ms to execute) on multiple CI machines, for mac CPU, Linux AVX2, Linux AVX 512, Linux ppc64.
The other argmax tests (same shape, different axis) are OK.
Need to reproduce/isolate this before we can look into it more...
