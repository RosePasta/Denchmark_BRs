	<summary>DL4J UI - play.api.UnexpectedException: Unexpected exception[InvocationTargetException: null]</summary>
	<description>
I'm getting an exception while running the UI.
Here's the code:
I just hit &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:9000/&gt;http://localhost:9000/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  once after the port is opened &amp; UI is started.
Selected the latest session where UI is running at the moment:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/517415/41141834-135bd924-6b11-11e8-9b63-7513b0d5f395.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And I got these results:

		Turns out you didn't actually include any code (looks like you intended to?)
I'm unable to reproduce this without some code (I tried a couple of things based on the stack trace, but everything runs fine for me)

		Since it was giving me error, I removed those block of code to go ahead and execute my code with other changes. Here you can find actual code that has UI in it:

		I still haven't been able to reproduce this. But looking at the stack trace again, the only thing this can be is a concurrent modification issue. I've implemented a check to avoid this here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5947&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/5947&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
