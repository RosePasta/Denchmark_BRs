	<summary>Training several networks at the same time leads to different results</summary>
	<description>
Since switching from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0:
When training several networks on different threads at the same time the output of each network is different. All networks have the same configuration (with seed) and are trained on the same data. For evaluation, the same data is used as well.
As expected, when training the networks sequentially the results are the same.
Code to reproduce:
I modified the MLPMnistSingleLayerExample:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Treiblesschorle/6eb13a505771a0b1fa2773ba1aa9a062&gt;https://gist.github.com/Treiblesschorle/6eb13a505771a0b1fa2773ba1aa9a062&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And created a trainer class:

Example code outputs the following:

		I ran your code on 0.7.0, on Windows 10 x64, nd4j-native.
Results with MKL: consistently the same each time.

Results with openblas: consistently different, when multithreaded
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/b30797912d274ab2b2a53e2a7333b178&gt;https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/b30797912d274ab2b2a53e2a7333b178&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Looks like this might be a thread safety issue with openblas?
Edit: Confirmed as an issue on Ubuntu 16.04 also:

		I rebuilt nd4j following the instructions here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/2353#issuecomment-262728273&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/2353#issuecomment-262728273&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The test seems to be consistently giving the same results with that. Perhaps it's the same underlying issue?

		Changes in the commit above fixes this issue. The cause is different, but it is due to OpenBLAS...

		Seems to be fixed - no reports of this issue since.
