	<summary>Libnd4j: boolean_and/or op crash</summary>
	<description>
Both boolean_and and boolean_or ops are crashing on the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    @Test
    public void testBooleanAnd(){
        INDArray arr1 = Nd4j.create(new long[]{3,4});
        INDArray arr2 = Nd4j.create(new long[]{3,4});
        INDArray out = Nd4j.create(new long[]{3,4});

        DynamicCustomOp op = DynamicCustomOp.builder("boolean_and")
                .addInputs(arr1, arr2)
                .addOutputs(out)
                .build();
        Nd4j.getExecutioner().exec(op);
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Crash log:

(Happens for both float and double precision)
Edit, unrelated: this line looks wrong (wrong op) for both ops:

		Oh, and we don't have a boolean_xor op. Need this one too as a broadcastable op.

		Hm. Good catch.

		Fixed now, and xor + not were added as well.
