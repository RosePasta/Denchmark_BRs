	<summary>DL4J: EvaluativeListener + Evaluation - reset causes labels to be lost</summary>

Hello, this is my code:
Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; names = new HashMap&lt;Integer, String&gt;() {{
put(0, "0_2");
put(1, "4_6");
.....
}};
Evaluation evaluation = new Evaluation(names);
EvaluativeListener evaluativeValidationListener = new EvaluativeListener(validationDataSetIterator, epoch, InvocationType.EPOCH_END, evaluation);
But in Confusion Matrix i still get 0...n numbers instead of "0_2", "4_6". Where is problem?

Problem here is that Evaluation.reset() clears confusion matrix; it's later re-created without the labels.
