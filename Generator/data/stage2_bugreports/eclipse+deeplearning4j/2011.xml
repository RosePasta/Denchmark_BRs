	<summary>Crash on deserializing updater when using half precision</summary>
	<description>
I just trained a network with cuda and half precision. Now I wanted to continue the training, again with half precision. In order to do so, I serialized the network and updater and try to deserialize it again. I used the serialisation/deserialisation code a lot now, so that should be ok. However, I get the following exception when loading the updater:

My serialisation code looks like this:

I'm using 0.5.0.

		Update: The same happens when I use your ModelSerializer class. Here is the stack trace

		I should also note that when I try to deserialize the configuration with normal precision, the deserialization works (does not crash) but complains about the different data types and that this can cause a loss of data.

		Fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/pull/1223&gt;deeplearning4j/nd4j#1223&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for highlighting this one.
