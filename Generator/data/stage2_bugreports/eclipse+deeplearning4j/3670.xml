	<summary>MNIST downloader: add checksum / validation</summary>
	<description>
It seems it is possible (though unlikely) for the downloaded MNIST data to be corrupted, but still read as if nothing is wrong.
The only symptom in my case: examples using the corrupted MNIST data would not learn. No exception or anything, just learning doesn't proceed as expected.
While we are at it: we should solve the "unexpected end of ZLIB stream" 'bad down' error once and for all (i.e., warn and re-download if it fails a check-sum or hash or something).
I've attached the contents of my /MNIST directory that was able to cause this:
