		It's available from Android 8.0 onwards so I wouldn't worry about it too much:

		Android 8.0 was is only 13 months old (general availability) according to my quick search - is that really enough for backward compatibility?

8.0 minimum cuts out the majority of users, if this is to be believed... &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/&gt;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Wait, that's in the version check? Did you change that recently?

		Nope, no changes recently...

		Strange, I guess we should at least add a catch block there and not fail in the event that this class doesn't load.
