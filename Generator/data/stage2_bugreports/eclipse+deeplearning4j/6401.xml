	<summary>ND4j: transposei is not inplace</summary>
	<description>
This is documented in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/linalg/api/ndarray/BaseNDArray.java#L4490&gt;NDArrayBase&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but very counterintuitive.
The transpose method is implemented using permute, and the inplace variant permutei seems to be working just fine.

		Hm, i vaguelly recall there was a reason for that but can't recally why. In c++ we definitely have inplace transpose permit.
So we should update java too. But that'll require check of existing usage of this method

		It was in-place at one point.
Looks like switching from permute to permutei (and copying current permutei to permute op) seems like it would work - i.e., I'm not seeing a reason why we can't have in-place transpose if we have in-place permute.
