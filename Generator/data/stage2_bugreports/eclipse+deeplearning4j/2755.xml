	<summary>WordVectorSerializer: Can't read ParagraphVectors with layer size &amp;lt; 3</summary>
	<description>
If I write ParagraphVectors with a layer size &lt; 3 with  and read them again with  then I get an NullPointerException. The problem seems to be that in  it assumes anything having less than 4 whitespace separated values to be a header. Hence, it skips the first line. See:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nlp-parent/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/models/embeddings/loader/WordVectorSerializer.java#L1727&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nlp-parent/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/models/embeddings/loader/WordVectorSerializer.java#L1727&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In my tests I'm on 0.6.0, however, the line did not change in 0.7.2 . I don't know if the problem is fixed otherwise until 0.7.2 .

		Ugh. Just out of curiousity - what's the use case for paravec layer size 2? :)

		Our sanity testcases :D Or if i want to directly plot the vectors without PCA etc.

		I think the best possible solution here would be just to add the same header. That'll improve compatibility with other frameworks, and will address your issue as well.

		Fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/2766&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/2766&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Now we just add header to CSV files, like other platforms do.
