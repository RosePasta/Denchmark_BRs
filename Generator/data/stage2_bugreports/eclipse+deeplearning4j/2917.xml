	<summary>bug - StopWords implementation is missing in TfidfVectorizer</summary>
	<description>
There is a bug in TfidfVectorizer in setStopWords() and perhaps too in build()
public Builder setStopWords(Collection stopWords) {
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        return this;
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
