		I've been unable to reproduce this.
Can you try deleting dl4j_w2vSentiment/ in your temp directory and re-run? (whatever directory is returned by System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"))
I suspect that somehow your data got corrupted somehow, and that's where the zero shape comes from.

		Both examples are still running fine for me. This still looks like data corruption issue as mentioned in previous comment.
