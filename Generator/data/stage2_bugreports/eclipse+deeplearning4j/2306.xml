	<summary>UI - histogram listener and /train location cause backend errors</summary>
	<description>
Histogram listener defers to a subset of the StatsListener.
However, if the user goes to /train instead of /weights, they will encounter a bunch of errors due to missing data.
Using histogram listener + /weights, or stats listener + /train (i.e., the intended use case) work fine.
