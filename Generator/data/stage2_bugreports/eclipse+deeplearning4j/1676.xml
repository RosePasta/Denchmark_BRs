	<summary>ModelSerializer: updater saving is not independent of backend</summary>
	<description>
Consider model updater saving here:

It seems to use standard java serialization for the updaters, which works fine, until you train on one backend and try to load the model (with an updater) on another.
Note that there is currently no way of serializing updaters that actually is platform independent. We will need to fix that first.

This fix will allow us to stream ndarrays and read them in across backends.
