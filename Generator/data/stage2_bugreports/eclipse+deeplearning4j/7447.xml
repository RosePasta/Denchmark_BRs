	<summary>ND4J : INDArray.slice() produces wrong shape (order is modified)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There's INDArray matrix filled with doubles and shape [2,1,2,1,1,16384,1,99]
Method matrix.slice(0) produces INDArray with shape [2,1,2,1,1,16384,1,102].
In example below - second column of vector is lost due to changed order.
double[] data = new double[]{15.0, 16.0};
INDArray vector = Nd4j.createFromArray(data.reshape(1,2));
INDArray slice = matrix.slice(0);

		Looks like it's this special case for vectors that is the problem:

I think we can remove that...
