	<summary>GloVe example NaN Error</summary>
	<description>
There was an issue in earlier versions but was fixed in 0.8.0 version &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/1622&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/1622&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here is the output I got from GloVe example after importing dl4j-examples and version is 0.9.1

I'm new to dl4j and just started with it so, It would be very helpful if someone could say if I have some wrong configs or there is a bug. Thanks

		I think that's a bug. I'll take a look there once i have some free time.

		Closing due to GloVe feature removal. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/7855#issuecomment-624616313&gt;#7855 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
