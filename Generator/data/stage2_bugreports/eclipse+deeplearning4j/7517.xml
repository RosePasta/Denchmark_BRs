	<summary>DL4J: NLP test failures</summary>
	<description>
1.### **org.deeplearning4j.models.word2vec.Word2VecTests
testUimaSentenceIterator - org.apache.uima.resource.ResourceInitializationException for "multidir" resources
2.reproducibleResults_ForMultipleRuns() - produces different results for similar runs during test set
running, works fine for isolated run. Looks like Linux only.
Caused by parallel iterator and will be investigated as standalone issue.
3.testWord2VecCBOW() - JVM crash on Windows when complete test setup runs.
4.TsneTest.testSimple()  - JVM crash
5.BagOfWordsVectorizerTest.testBagOfWordsVectorizer() - assert failed
6. Word2VecTestsSmall.testUnkSerialization_1() - NPE
