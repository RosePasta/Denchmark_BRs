	<summary>NaN in word coordinates after running tsne plot</summary>
	<description>
I was running Word2vec &lt;denchmark-link:http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec.html&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on a small (10k sentence) dataset everything went fine, but I got NaN in words coordinates during tsne ploting.
val tsne = new BarnesHutTsne.Builder()
  .setMaxIter(1000)
  .stopLyingIteration(250)
  .learningRate(500)
  .useAdaGrad(false)
  .theta(0.5)
  .setMomentum(0.5)
  .normalize(true)
  .usePca(false)
  .build()
vec.lookupTable().plotVocab(tsne)
Setting Nd4j.ENFORCE_NUMERICAL_STABILITY = true fixed the problem.
