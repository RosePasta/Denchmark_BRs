	<summary>ND4S Build issue</summary>
	<description>
Technically this only impacts the Skymind fork AFAIK (not yet merged here), but I'll log it here anyway...
After recent UX improvements to ND4J, ND4S is having trouble resolving some methods
In think there are 2 problems:

Additional toString overloads
Scala having trouble with java primitive varargs methods (seems like it can't find or use them??)

Full compilation errors below. My scala knowledge isn't sufficient to fix this, and googling the varargs issue didn't result in a solution...
