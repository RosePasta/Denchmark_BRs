	<summary>Bug in org.deeplearning4j.nn.conf.graph.L2NormalizeVertex equals implementation</summary>
	<description>
Found on tag 1.0.0-beta3 but appears to be present on more branches.
The equals implem checks for int[] equality with == operator. This should probably be replaced by Arrays.equals.
Furthermore, the hashcode method is constant and ignores both fields of the class. Is this intended ?

		Yes, both are clearly bugs, thanks for flagging. The equals and hashcode methods should simply be removed; it's suffirient to use the methods generated by the lombok @Data method already on the class.
Feel free to send us a PR if you want - or I'll look to fix it at some point this week.
