	<summary>BatchNorm + ActivationLayer performance issue</summary>
	<description>
UPDATE: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/1536&gt;#1536&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 provided an update to the algorithm and differentiated the approach between dnn (gamma &amp; beta per activation) and cnn (gamma &amp; beta per feature map). Performance is still not meeting expectations.
Help is wanted to review and confirm layer configuration. Gradient check tests have been added but partially fail. Also, check this example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/ComputerVision-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/cv/cifar/TestModels/BatchNormModel.java&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/ComputerVision-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/cv/cifar/TestModels/BatchNormModel.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 regarding performance and disregard the warning about reset which is an unrelated issue.

		The &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/134&gt;#134&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 issue was in the way of continuing to debug this issue but the issue still exists Troubleshooting can continue.

 its still there. It's been collapsed into a script with multiple models: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/ComputerVision-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/cv/TestModels/CifarCaffeModels.java#L201&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/ComputerVision-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/cv/TestModels/CifarCaffeModels.java#L201&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
