Burndown list for failing tests on CUDA

SubsamplingLayerTest: Looks like avg pool forward/backprop ops are actually calling max pool instead?
LocallyConnectedLayerTest - JVM crash (fix ND4J SameDiff CUDA first, it's SameDiff layer)
BarnesHutTsneTest.testSpTree - JVM crash - https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/8629accddb5c974402c1f2ee6bdb2ffe

Edit: SP Tree test still failing as of 2019/08/23
More to come. Tested so far on CUDA 10.1, Windows 10, GTX 970
