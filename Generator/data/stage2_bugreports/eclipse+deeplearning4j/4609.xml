	<summary>Incorrect output vs. serialized model</summary>
	<description>
Test case from here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4604&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4604&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Output differs vs. same model saved/loaded with model serializer.

		So this had nothing to do with serialized models - this was actually an edge case for workspaces with scalars.
Fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4j/pull/2600&gt;deeplearning4j/nd4j#2600&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Test that reproduces the problem added here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4611&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/4611&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
