	<summary>DL4J: OOM memory dump is broken?</summary>
	<description>
The only output I'm getting recently on OOMs is as follows:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/a1437ed171d95df6a553025377947d81&gt;https://gist.github.com/AlexDBlack/a1437ed171d95df6a553025377947d81&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Note the &lt;Error generating network memory status information section&gt;
I suspect this was due to some recent refactoring (moving a few components to Nd4J) but either way, this needs to be fixed...
