	<summary>Glove code giving NaN as output</summary>
	<description>
When running the code for Glove inside dl4j, its giving Nan as output.
16:37:02.443 [main] INFO  deeplearning.GloVeExample - Day/night similarity: NaN
16:37:02.465 [main] INFO  deeplearning.GloVeExample - Nearest words to 'day': [i, do, to, nt, the, that, s, he, you, is, we].
Please help to solve the issue.

		Please provide more details: what you're using as input text, what you're using as pom.xml etc.
As much details as possible please

		Just tried it as well (running GloVeExample). I see it using both rc3.9 and master (tried only the CPU backend).

		Maybe try using double for the data type? &lt;denchmark-link:http://nd4j.org/userguide&gt;http://nd4j.org/userguide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Using float/double shouldn't affect results there. So that definitely sounds like a problem.

    org.deeplearning4j
    deeplearning4j-nlp
    0.4-rc3.9

This is the dependency, I am using. 
And input the same rawtext.txt in the dl4j(resource) folder

		Could you get rid of the deeplearning4j-examples? I'm not sure where you would have gotten that from.

		Seems to be still an issue in version 0.8.0. Tried using the example sample but could not run the code successfully. This seems to be the same issue as mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/issues/227&gt;eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples#227&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Closing this (and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/issues/227&gt;eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples#227&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) after verifying the Glove example runs fine on 0.8.0. Gist of output &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/RobAltena/ee07ed279d67070564498ec205d70444&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/raver119&gt;@raver119&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This issue still occurs in dl4j versions 1.0.0-alpha and 1.0.0-beta, as mentioned in the comment here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3462&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/3462&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Sometimes the NaN issue doesn't occur, but even if the similarity is a number then the results  are way off.  Is there any workaround or a fix on the roadmap?

		I closed this issue because it was inactive, old and many versions behind. And the example ran fine.
If you want to increase the odds of people looking into this issue then please submit a gist with an example to reproduce the bug. For even better odds: A failing unit test.

 do I submit the unit test via a pull request? Or do I just create a separate mini-project and add the unit test there?

		Create a separate mini project in a gist. Refer to it in a new issue. (Because this one really refers to an ancient version).
