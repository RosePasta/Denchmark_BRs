	<summary>Check S3ModelSaver</summary>
	<description>
As quickly discussed over &lt;denchmark-link:https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j?at=56c20f2538f56aa31f3a1c2e&gt;gitter&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,  is not working properly.
When trying to save a Word2Vec model, the following warning is sent:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARN  [2016-02-15 17:32:24,745] com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Client: No content length specified for stream data.  Stream contents will be buffered in memory and could result in out of memory errors.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In the S3 bucket, a file with 0B is created. The methods load and exists are also lacking implementation.
