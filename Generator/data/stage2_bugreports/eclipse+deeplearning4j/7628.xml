	<summary>DL4J: problems in VPTree and TSNE implementations</summary>
	<description>

Current implementation of VPTree in parallel mode has race conditions and its output is unstable.
This test fails sporadically when output of similar tree woith different workers count in this test org.deeplearning4j.clustering.vptree.VPTreeNodeTest##testParallel().

2.org.deeplearning4j.clustering.vptree.BarnesHutTsne - output is unstable and IllegalStateException can be thrown in some cases sporadically. Probably it is related to VPTree issues.
