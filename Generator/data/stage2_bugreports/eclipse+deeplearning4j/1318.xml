	<summary>WordVectorSerializer loadTxtVectors from an InputStream</summary>
	<description>
Can you guys implement a method:
WordVectorSerializer.loadTxtVectors(InputStream)
Because this line does not work when the file I'm loading is in a jar:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;filePath = new ClassPathResource("cardio2-dx-sgns-symps.vec").getFile().getAbsolutePath();
dxSySiWordVec = WordVectorSerializer.loadTxtVectors(new File(filePath));
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is already implemented at current master. I mean loading from stream.


You're getting wrong whole idea of ClassPathResource.


File resource = new ClassPathResource("cardio2-dx-sgns-symps.vec").getFile();
dxSySiWordVec = WordVectorSerializer.loadTxtVectors(resource);
That should work, at least if you're using Canova for ClassPathResource.
p.s. probably you'd need to add trailing slash, /cardio2-dx..., if you're taking file from jar. That was fixed on current master though.

		Sir. It does not work. If the above mentioned lines are in a class that end up in a jar. And the file I'm loading is in the jar then it does not load. I do use: import org.canova.api.util.ClassPathResource.
And, by the way, it does not throw an exception either. It is as if loads an empty model.
Does not work with trailing slash
