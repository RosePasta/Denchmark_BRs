	<summary>Android BLAS dependency error</summary>
	<description>
I am sharing example android project for deeplearning4j which fails on finding BLAS dependency files. I have tried to implement JVM flags by editting gradle.properties file with addition of
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dcom.github.fommil.netlib.BLAS=com.github.fommil.netlib.F2jBLAS 
-Dcom.github.fommil.netlib.LAPACK=com.github.fommil.netlib.F2jLAPACK 
-Dcom.github.fommil.netlib.ARPACK=com.github.fommil.netlib.F2jARPACK
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

code line and it did not work.
Link to project  = &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Refikcanmalli/dl4j-android.git&gt;https://github.com/Refikcanmalli/dl4j-android.git&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Link to full stack trace = &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Refikcanmalli/b3189184ae41bb9a6999&gt;https://gist.github.com/Refikcanmalli/b3189184ae41bb9a6999&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I've confirmed your project runs successfully with above PR in ND4J.
Once above PR is merged, would you please install latest ND4J SNAPSHOT from github source into your local maven repository, and then modify nd4j-x86 version in your project dependencies?
