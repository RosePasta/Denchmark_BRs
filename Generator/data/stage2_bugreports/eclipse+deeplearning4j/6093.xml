 enables to use Convolution1DLayer with BatchNormalization layers, thanks a lot!
I try to implement a 1D CNN classification for timeseries from this &lt;denchmark-link:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06455.pdf&gt;paper&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (the FCN, here is the according dl4j code &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/reuschling/ba771bb80b609b10cc3c328bdc489086&gt;Gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
The layers are 3 times  with a succeeding  (not sure the activation layers are needed, you've written this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/4093&gt;issue #4093&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The  gives no exception now, but the  says

I commented this also at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/issues/2418&gt;issue #2418&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), just for information.

		Possible quick workaround: you may be able to simply add a FeedForwardToRnnPreProcessor before the global pooling layer.
Beyond that, I'll need to took at this in the debugger...

		The code is running without Exception with the PreProcessor üëç
