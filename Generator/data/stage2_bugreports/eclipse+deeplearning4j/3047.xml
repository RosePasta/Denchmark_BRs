	<summary>Custom activation functions (not directly implementing IActivation) not being registered as a subtype</summary>
	<description>
I ran into a problem while playing with DL4J.
I created a custom activation function for my network and tryied to attach the ui listener.
All is working but the model viewer.
here are the infos for my code

		This doesn't look specific to the UI - rather, your custom activation function can't be loaded.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Caused by: org.nd4j.shade.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Could not resolve type id 'CosActivation' into a subtype of [simple type, class org.nd4j.linalg.activations.IActivation]: known type ids = [Cube, ELU, HardSigmoid, HardTanh, IActivation, Identity, LReLU, RReLU, ReLU, Sigmoid, SoftPlus, SoftSign, Softmax, TanH]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Two possibilities here:

Your custom activation function class isn't on the classpath (i.e., save json -&gt; load later without). Look like that isn't the case from your code
Something has gone wrong with registering custom subtypes for JSON serialization

 Can you try the following, and let me know if it throws the same exception?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;String str = conf.toJson();
MultiLayerConfiguration c2 = MultiLayerConfiguration.fromJson(str);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hello I tried this and yes I had the same exception.
I was thinking that was because I had to register my activation function.

 I was able to reproduce this.
My guess: your custom activation function (you didn't provide it) is extending another activation function class - such as BaseActivationFunction. It isn't being properly discovered by the reflection library.
There's an easy workaround: take your pick of the following:
CosActivation extends BaseActivationFunction implements IActivation
CosActivation implements IActivation

		yes you were right.
here is my activation function with correction. Sorry I didn't add it before.
