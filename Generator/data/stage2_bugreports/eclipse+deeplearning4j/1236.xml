	<summary>DBOW handles only the very beginning words in each sentence?</summary>
	<description>
The implementation of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-scaleout/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/models/embeddings/learning/impl/sequence/DBOW.java#L100-L109&gt;dbow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in dl4j-nlp doesn't seem to make sense.
Supposed that we have one label for each document.  will be 1, so that  can only be  due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-scaleout/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/models/embeddings/learning/impl/sequence/DBOW.java#L104&gt;if(c &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; c &lt; labels.size())&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. When  is big enough (e.g. twice of the ),  won't be  so that  won't be called.
Besides, I don't think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-scaleout/deeplearning4j-nlp/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/models/embeddings/learning/impl/sequence/DBOW.java#L102&gt;if(a != window)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 make sense neither, according to the following figure.

		You're looking into current master, right?
upd: yes, that's current master. That's one of the recent changes, made after 3.8.
Tests are passing after this change, but i'll check it once again, thanks.

		Actually you're right here. There should be primitive roll over words -&gt; labels, without any windows on dbow phase. Looks like copy &amp; paste issue :/
Thanks for letting me know!

		p.s. fixed, and will be merged a bit later: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/1237&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/pull/1237&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm still planning changes to ParagraphVectors, there's proper inference still lacking. So, more changes to come soon.
Thanks for help!
