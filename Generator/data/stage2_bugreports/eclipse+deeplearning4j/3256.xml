	<summary>MultiLayerConfiguration: Bias learning rate global config isn't inherited properly</summary>
	<description>
Running AlexNet from benchmark repo:
Global config is set via builder to .biasLearningRate(1e-2*2) but layerwise configuration ends up as "biasLearningRate" : 0.01, (from json).
Need to check ComputationGraphConfiguration too.
