	<summary>UI doesn't show full model if backprop is set to false</summary>
	<description>
When pretraining is set to false (e.g., in the example for &lt;denchmark-link:https://deeplearning4j.org/stackeddenoisingautoencoder.html&gt;stacked denoising autoencoders&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) the full model is not visible in the UI. Only the individual layers, except the output, are included.

		By design. UI has different sessions for layerwise pretraining vs. backprop.
During pretraining, only the currently trained layer should be present in the corresponding session.
