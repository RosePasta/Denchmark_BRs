	<summary>App get stuck when trying to open browser for HistogramIterationListener</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to use the HistogramIterationListener, works well with the AdditionRNN.java example. When I use it in my application, the URL is correctly produced but it get stuck when it comes to open the browser or a new tab, so the training doesn't go any further (it does without the listener).

		Aha. So it sounds like a dependency conflict somewhere in your pom.xml

		that should be something network-related. httpcomponents, jersey (if present), etc.
So i'd suggest to start checking mvn dependency:tree to check for overrides there
