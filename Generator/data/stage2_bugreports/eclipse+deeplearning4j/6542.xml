	<summary>a.mmuli(b, result) accepts results of wrong shape if multiplication result is a scalar</summary>
	<description>
This works, but I would expect it to throw an error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Nd4j.rand(1, 3).mmuli(Nd4j.rand(3, 1), Nd4j.createUninitialized(new int[]{10, 10, 1}))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This may easily happen when one mixes up the order of a and b, and instead of getting a helpful exception, you get some uninitialized memory as the result.
