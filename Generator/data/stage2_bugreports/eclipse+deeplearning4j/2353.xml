	<summary>OpenBLAS multithreading crash - Running MnistMLPExample error.</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm trying to run dl4j example and I faced with the error which I cannot resolve.
I use JDK8_u112 and macOS 10.12.
Here is Stdout and hs_err_pid50428.log

any suggestions?
UPD: The same problem with TrainingStatsExample and SparkLSTMCharacterExample

		Ah, looks like we might have an answer here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/539#issuecomment-92445199&gt;xianyi/OpenBLAS#539 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The binaries were built with NUM_THREADS=4, so try to  before running DL4J.

		I've hit a very similar or possibly identical issue, as discussed on gitter.
Here's the log after setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 (also crashed without that, using 12 threads)

		I am currently using this script file to build OpenBLAS for the release:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/blob/master/openblas/cppbuild.sh&gt;https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/blob/master/openblas/cppbuild.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I've fixed it accordingly, but would like to confirm that it solves this issue.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/green-creeper&gt;@green-creeper&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AlexDBlack&gt;@AlexDBlack&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Could you try to rebuild and run that on your machines?
It's basically:
git clone https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets
export OpenBLAS_HOME=$PWD/javacpp-presets/openblas/cppbuild/your-platform/
cd javacpp-presets/openblas
bash cppbuild.sh install
And then build libnd4j and ND4J as usual.

		Quick test of this un Ubuntu 16.04 + Spark MnistMLPExample: 0.7.0 crashes with default settings
New code seems more stable, but I can (unsuprisingly) easily make it crash by setting sparkConf.setMaster("local[256]"); in the example.
I'm doing a full run with local[12] (on a 6 core + HT machine - so equivalent to local[*] here). No issues after a couple of epochs; I'll update this comment once it's finished (or not).
Edit: 15 epochs completed without issue.
