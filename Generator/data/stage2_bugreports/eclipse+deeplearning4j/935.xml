	<summary>ScoreIterationListener error in Scala.</summary>
	<description>
I tried the Scala example shown in the linear regression page: &lt;denchmark-link:http://pastebin.com/3uyKyCPU&gt;http://pastebin.com/3uyKyCPU&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . The ScoreIterationListener seem not to work , nothing being printed, but no error is shown. Probably is a problem with Scala since also the HistogramIterationListener has also a problem in Scala.
