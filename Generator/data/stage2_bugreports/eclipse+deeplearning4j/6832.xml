	<summary>Toy example of RL4J throws DL4JInvalidInputException</summary>
	<description>
Fail to run the toy example with the new update of rl4j (updated 2 days ago). It throws org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidInputException: Input that is not a matrix; expected matrix (rank 2), got rank 1 array with shape [1]. Missing preprocessor or wrong input type? (layer name: layer0, layer index: 0, layer type: DenseLayer)
