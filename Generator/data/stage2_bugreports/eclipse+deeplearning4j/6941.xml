	<summary>BaseDatasetIterator#next does not apply preprocessing</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Method next() does not apply preprocessor. The method next(int num) does however.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please indicate relevant versions, including, if relevant:

Deeplearning4j version: 1.0.0-beta3

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Contributing&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Probably quicker for you to do since it is trivial.
