	<summary>DL4J UI: Updates/Gradients tabs on overview page broken</summary>
	<description>
Clicking on Updates/Gradients tabs doesn't actually do anything, the activations graph (default) continue to be shown.
Tabs on the model page work fine.

		Turns out the problem is simple: the tabs do work but under some limited circumstances the update won't fire. This has been fixed and will be merged to master soonish.
