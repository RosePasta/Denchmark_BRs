	<summary>Score is always NaN for simple CNN example</summary>
	<description>
As discussed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AlexDBlack&gt;@AlexDBlack&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 : I want to create a simple proof of concept example, reading in 3 images of size 100 x 100 with different colors, the CNN should categorize them. Even with a very slow learning rate I always get just NaN as scores.

		Could this be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/issues/1646&gt;#1646&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? Since the input images are made up of the same values  (each input image is a solid color).
Have you tried running your code with another image?

		Yes I tried it with different images, also for example with the llw dataset.

		Please the code and comments in the gist below. I get valid scores and eval results.

The preprocessor wasn't applied to the iterator in your code.
Closing out.

		Oh thank you!
And sorry, I thought I checked after applying the preprocessor by iterating over the data set, thought it was applied, but now i get it. perfect!
