	<summary>Unexpected state occurred for AsyncDataSetIterator</summary>
	<description>
I'm getting an java.lang.IllegalStateException in AsyncDataSetIterator when trying to run Word2VecSentimentRNN example imported into my own project.  The exception always occurs after the 500th iteration.   The only modifications I've made to the example are changing the path to the word vectors and serializing the model once evaluation is finished.  The serialization code is never hit because the exception is thrown before evaluation.
Here is the stack trace:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unexpected state occurred for AsyncDataSetIterator: runnable died or no data available

		Note that I refactored the example to feed the vectors in one at a time (per &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/raver119&gt;@raver119&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's suggestion) and it completes successfully:
while (train.hasNext()) {
net.fit(train.next());
}

		What about tests i've asked you to run?
