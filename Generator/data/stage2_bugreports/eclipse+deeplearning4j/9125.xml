	<summary>SD_FORBID_HELPERS not doing anything</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ran into some problem with DNN on an old AMD Turion processor so wanted to test without the native mkldnn helper. Tried various way to set SD_FORBID_HELPERS to disable the helper but couldn't get it to work.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running deeplearning4j-1.0.0-beta7
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Additional Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I found in libnd4j/include/legacy/impl/Environment.cpp what looks like a typo in the check. It pulls in the environment variable into a local variable and then performs a check against another local variable.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        /**
         * If this env var is defined - we'll disallow use of platform-specific helpers (mkldnn, cudnn, etc)
         */
        const char* forbid_helpers = std::getenv("SD_FORBID_HELPERS");
        if (max_master_threads != nullptr) {
            _allowHelpers = false;
        }

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The forbid_helpers variable is not checked anywhere else in the code.

		Try to set SD_MASTER_THREADS then and see if that makes a difference :)
Also try to set ND4J_FALLBACK, ND4J_MKL_FALLBACK=true, and SD_BLAS_FALLBACK.

		Pro tip! :)
I already did as I found missing check in the code. And it worked. Now it's a lot slower on the DNN operations but it hasn't crashed yet. I'll keep watching it but previous record was 13h now it already passed 25h so looks promising.

		You got it. I created PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9126&gt;#9126&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but need to get the ECA signed.

		Created PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j/pull/9127&gt;#9127&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 instead. Looks like the signoff worked this time.
