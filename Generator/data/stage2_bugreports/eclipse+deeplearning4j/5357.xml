	<summary>ND4J Activation functions: enforce same shape in backprop method</summary>
	<description>

so our activation functions (a=f(z)) return dL/dz given dL/da and z
in all cases (though, in principle it could differ), dL/dz and dL/da and z must all have exactly the same shape

Yet: we don't actually enforce this properly at the ActivationFunction level. Some of the internal ops may throw an exception, however (but this is not guaranteed for all cases it seems).
