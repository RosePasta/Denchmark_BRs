	<summary>Make it so AWS isn't required</summary>
	<description>
Currently if you run RV and don't have an AWS profile configured it'll crash with a boto exception. We shouldn't require this to be setup in order to run RV locally.

		I tried this again and didn't get an error, but we should do something about the run script requiring some AWS stuff. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/blob/develop/scripts/run#L26-L27&gt;https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/blob/develop/scripts/run#L26-L27&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 We should have a non-aws option.

		This line seems to be the culprit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/blob/develop/src/rastervision/utils/files.py#L15&gt;https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/blob/develop/src/rastervision/utils/files.py#L15&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
