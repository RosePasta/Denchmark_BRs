	<summary>./scripts/infra destroy does not terminate instances</summary>
	<description>
After running ./scripts/infra destroy the spot fleet and associated instances should be terminated. However, it only seems to terminate the spot fleet, while leaving the instance running. The following error message is printed:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;aws_spot_fleet_request.gpu_worker: Still destroying... (5m0s elapsed)
Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* aws_spot_fleet_request.gpu_worker: fleet still has (1) running instances

Terraform does not automatically rollback in the face of errors.
Instead, your Terraform state file has been partially updated with
any resources that successfully completed. Please address the error
above and apply again to incrementally change your infrastructure.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		We're not using Terraform anymore to start Ec2 instances.
