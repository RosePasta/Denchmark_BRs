	<summary>Model bundles with polygon output try to write to private S3 bucket</summary>
	<description>
Running the following command tries to write a file to s3: //raster-vision-lf-dev/examples/spacenet-vegas-buildings-ss/output_6_27c/predict/1332-0-polygons.json which is in a private bucket. I never noticed it before because I have access to that bucket :) The predict command is trying to write to the same bucket used when the model bundle was generated. This usually doesn't happen, but it is because the polygon output uses a different code path.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;rastervision predict https://s3.amazonaws.com/azavea-research-public-data/raster-vision/examples/model-zoo-0.12/spacenet-vegas-buildings-ss/model-bundle.zip https://s3.amazonaws.com/azavea-research-public-data/raster-vision/examples/model-zoo-0.12/spacenet-vegas-buildings-ss/1929.tif /opt/data/prediction.tif
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To avoid something like this in the future, we should test the predict command with our usual AWS profile blanked out.
