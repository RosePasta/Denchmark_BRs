	<summary>Not using best_model.h5</summary>
	<description>
The train_model task saves the best model (according to the validation loss) as best_model.h5. However, this model is not used by tasks that are run subsequently during the same invocation of the program. Instead, the model, as trained by the final epoch, is used by subsequent tasks, unless the program is run again, at which point best_model.h5 file will be loaded.
