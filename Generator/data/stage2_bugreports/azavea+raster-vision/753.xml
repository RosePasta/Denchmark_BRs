	<summary>file_exists() only checks prefix</summary>
	<description>
file_exists('s3://whatever/model') returns True even though s3://whatever/model is not a file that exists. It returns True because that prefix exists. This is making it so the train command is being skipped by the runner even though the train command previously failed.
