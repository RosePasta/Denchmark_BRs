	<summary>Installing Nvidia drivers doesn't work</summary>
	<description>
When building the AMI, the install-nvidia-drivers.sh fails with base AMI 'ami-9109beee (latest deep learning ami) and Nvidia drivers 384.125. I was able to get it to run with the --install-libglvnd flag. But, when I start an instance with the resulting AMI, running nvidia-smi reports that the drivers aren't installed. At the moment, the latest base AMI has the Nvidia drivers we need, so I've commented out installing them, but in the future we may need this.
