	<summary>Cannot make train_ratio 1.0</summary>
	<description>
To maximize performance, sometimes one would like to train a model using the entire development dataset, in other words, using a train_ratio of 1.0. This causes the program to crash. As a workaround , we have been using a train_ratio of 0.99.

		This issue is no longer applicable to the current and future versions of Raster Vision so I am closing it.
