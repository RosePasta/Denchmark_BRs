	<summary>Why its forced an external evaluator  with save_eval_predictions</summary>
	<description>
right know if I want to save the predictions file. I have to setup an external_evaluator, but if for
example I'm doing a classification or tagger model, none of those external evals helps me
but I need to save the predictions into a file.
Could be possible to save the predictions file and not setup an external eval?
because right know its crashing here:
File "/Users/sergio.hurtado/gitlab/NaturalLanguageRecognition/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/opennmt/utils/evaluator.py", line 187, in make_scorers
name = name.lower()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'
since I want to save the file but I dont want an evaluator external so its None
