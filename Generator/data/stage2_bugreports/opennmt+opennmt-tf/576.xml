	<summary>Bug in "onmt-ark-to-records" code</summary>
	<description>
I have found a small bug in the code line referenced below. It causes the script to terminate with a TypeError: data type not understood. Just for the sake of completeness, this is caused by the fact that numpy doesn't understand the object tf.float32. I changed that to float and it worked as it was supposed to. I can create a PR for this, but I suppose it is too trivial to do so and claim a contribution, unless you want me to.



OpenNMT-tf/opennmt/bin/ark_to_records.py


         Line 46
      in
      5809c29






 return idx, np.asarray(vector, dtype=tf.float32)
