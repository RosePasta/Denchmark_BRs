Can I help you with  the issue? I'm not familiar with the code base, but I can try to reproduce it locally and extract the context if necessary.

		Hello,
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cservan&gt;@cservan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Does the error mean anything to you?

Can I help you with the issue? I'm not familiar with the code base, but I can try to reproduce it locally and extract the context if necessary.

Sure, that would be helpful. If you want to go further and fix the issue, you could first try to add a test in  to reproduce the error. (You can find more information on how to run tests &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guillaumekln&gt;@guillaumekln&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I'll take a look, it seems it comes from the "prf" scorer.
Cheers,
C.

		It is most likely related to an empty hypothesis or reference.
