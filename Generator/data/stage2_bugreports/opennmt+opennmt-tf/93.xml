	<summary>Installation via pip</summary>
	<description>
A direct pip install of the package,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install git+git://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf.git@v1.0.2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

gives an error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Python 3.6.4 (default, Mar  8 2018, 13:06:21)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import opennmt
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/opennmt/__init__.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    from opennmt import decoders
ImportError: cannot import name 'decoders'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think the issue is in setup.py, the packages settings is set to ["opennmt"] instead of letting find_packages() find Python modules. I also noticed the find_packages() was removed in this commit.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/commit/70ffde8895810b9d880331f127143e3a5b6ddab7#diff-2eeaed663bd0d25b7e608891384b7298&gt;70ffde8#diff-2eeaed663bd0d25b7e608891384b7298&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is there any reasons for this?
Thanks

		Thanks for pointing this out!
The change you referenced was incorrect and setup.py did not get much attention lately. I fixed this in the commit above and will also make sure to set the correct version with the next release. If this file needs other improvements, I would love a PR or feedback!
Also, let's keep this issue open until the pip experience is improved. For example, I would like to include the scripts from bin in the main package.

		Thanks!
I added a PR to add the  scripts to the package: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/pull/94&gt;#94&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It would be also be great if the package releases would be &lt;denchmark-link:http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html&gt;uploaded to PyPi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks!
