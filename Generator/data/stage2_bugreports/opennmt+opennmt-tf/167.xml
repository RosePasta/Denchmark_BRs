Hi,
I am using the NMTBig model to train a set of English-Chinese data. The training process goes well but when I used the trained model to predict my development/test data, the following error comes out:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): flat indices[814, :] = [5, 12, 6] does not index into param (shape: [7,30,5,10]). [[Node: seq2seq/decoder_1/decoder_1/GatherNd = GatherNd[Tindices=DT_INT32, Tparams=DT_FLOAT, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](seq2seq/decoder_1/decoder_1/Reshape_2, seq2seq/decoder_1/decoder_1/stack)]] 
Do you have any clue why this is happening?
Many thanks.

		Hello,
This is a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/issues/142&gt;#142&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, please check this issue and the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/issues/142#issuecomment-394279587&gt;current workaround&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
As several people have already encountered this bug, I will try to reproduce it and submit a fix to TensorFlow.
