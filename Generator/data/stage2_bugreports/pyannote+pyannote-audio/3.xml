	<summary>Squared euclidean distance in triplet sampling</summary>
	<description>
The original FaceNet paper uses squared euclidean distance in the triplet selection algorithm.
As of now, we use the regular euclidean distance:
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hbredin/pyannote-audio/commit/9b59990a107a453140c2cea684d23cf95496a79c#diff-25feed99c8806859b2dcd889d2dcc34fR137&gt;hbredin@9b59990#diff-25feed99c8806859b2dcd889d2dcc34fR137&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It probably isn't big of a deal but changing euclidean to sqeuclidean would not only result in being identical to the original paper, but also speed up this part of the code.
