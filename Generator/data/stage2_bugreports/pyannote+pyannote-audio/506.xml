	<summary>Out-of-bound error during inference</summary>
	<description>

Where was the error being thrown? Did the tests not pick it up?

This fix is more a hack than an actual fix -- we should have a closer look.
Tests did not pick it up. It happened in the corner case where has_last_chunk is False.
This would fail with a shape mismatch error for the very last chunk:



pyannote-audio/pyannote/audio/core/inference.py


        Lines 301 to 303
      in
      83eeffd






 aggregated_output[ 



 start_frame : start_frame + num_frames_per_chunk 



 ] += output 





We should create an issue to write proper unit tests for this.
