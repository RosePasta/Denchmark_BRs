	<summary>url for quant BERT config.json is invalid</summary>
	<description>
hello, I come from [this issue](&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IntelLabs/nlp-architect/issues/163&gt;#163&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. And now I'm using the newest version of nlp-architect, while the url
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;https://nlp-architect-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/models/transformers/bert-base-uncased.json
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

is still invalid. Could you please fix the server and provide new url as soon as possible?
thanks
