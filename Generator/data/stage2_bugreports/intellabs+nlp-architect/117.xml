	<summary>bug: Silent python-dev dependency</summary>
	<description>
While trying to  the package (from master) for the 1st time, the setup failed with nasty errors on my Ubuntu machine. I did everything written in the README, but still got errors that did little to figure out what went wrong. Only later I've learned that also python3.6-dev is required - at least for my environment. (thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ofirzaf&gt;@ofirzaf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )
If python-dev really is a dependency, perhaps it should be reflected better for a newbie like me in the README installation instructions. Possibly, even throw AssertionError or warning from setup.py. Ideally, Python.h wouldn't be a dependency unless compilation is required to build the repo, but that's a discussion for another thread.
I'm running: Ubuntu16.04 with Python3.6 in a clean virtualenv with latest pip.
