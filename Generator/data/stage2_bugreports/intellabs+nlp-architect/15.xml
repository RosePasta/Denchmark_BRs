	<summary>Problem with downloading pre-trained models</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hello everyone. I tried to launch REST server as in following tutorial: &lt;denchmark-link:http://nlp_architect.nervanasys.com/service.html&gt;Link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, in process of starting server some pre-trained models were downloaded, and seems like some model files contain only error. Starting server crashes with KeyError on trying to unpickle model_info.dat in ner_api.py. Contents of model_info.dat after download:

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 Clone nlp-architect
 Make environment (make in root)
 Launch server (hug -p 8080 -f server/serve.py)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Plazmius&gt;@Plazmius&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for reporting this error.
We've fixed the model files and the above should work.
