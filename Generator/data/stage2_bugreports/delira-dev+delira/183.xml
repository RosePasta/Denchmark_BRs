	<summary>[Bug] Checkpoints will not be saved</summary>
	<description>
Description
If a checkpoint frequency is set it is expected that a new checkpoint is created at suiting checkpoints.
Due to wrong indent in BaseNetworkTrainer.train at line 488 this is no longer happening.
In addition wouldn't it make sense to write a checkpoint at the end of training ? Not regarding checkpoint frequency or best checkpoint. (TfNetworkTrainer._at_training_end)

		The indentation is fixed in PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/delira-dev/delira/pull/182&gt;#182&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which needs some additions regarding the notebooks. I like the idea of saving the last model (I would add this to the basetrainer instead of adding it to a specific trainer) :)

		I created a new Issue for the feature requests and fixed in the bug in a separate PR to move things forward.
