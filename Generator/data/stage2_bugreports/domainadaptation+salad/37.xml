	<summary>The Datasets SVHN</summary>
	<description>
The code in salad/datasets/digits/svhn.py could not get svhn, since in the newest pytorch, the Download arg For torchvision.datasets.SVHN is False. Would You fix it to make data loading more elegant? thx A Lot

		the problem could easily be fixed by downloading the SVHN Dataset in expected dir in advance, so it should not be a problem

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/A-suozhang&gt;@A-suozhang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , thanks for flagging this.
The option in salad/datasets/digits/svhn.py is simply wrapping https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#svhn, thus in case you use the dataset, you have to provide the download arg yourself.
Did you come across a code example where the download arg is missing though? That should be corrected.

		I Directly import the class digitloader, then the error occurs, i didn't seem to quite find the way to feed in arg download when defining the Digitloader. It maybe my problem...
