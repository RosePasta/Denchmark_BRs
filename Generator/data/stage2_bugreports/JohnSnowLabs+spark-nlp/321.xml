	<summary>Set config path in python do not reset the new S3 credentials in ResourceDownloader</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When the application.conf file is updated with different credentials of S3 it is not reflected in the resource downloader to download pretrained models.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

on setConfigPath in ConfigLoader should reset the S3 credentials in Resource Downloader as well.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Current Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

setConfigPath in ConfigLoader does not reset the S3 credentials in Resource Downloader resulting in no effect in S3 download unless the cluster restart
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Steps to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Give a wrong s3 credentials in application.conf and download any pretrained model.
The download will fail.
Now fix the s3 credentials in application.conf and do set_config_path. Now retry to download the pretrained models.
The same invalid credentials error will come even though now the credentials have been fixed.

		Fixed by creating a method resetResourceDownloader which will reset the cache and recreate the defaultDownloader object by using latest credentials from application.conf.
Called this new method in setCofigPath. Now every time setConfigPath is set the new config details will be updated in reseourceDownloader.
