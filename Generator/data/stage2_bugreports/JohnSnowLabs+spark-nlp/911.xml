	<summary>Misspelled param name in ContextSpellChecker</summary>
	<description>
in a method in the ContextSpellCheckerApproach class. The set class threshold method is named setClassTreshold  and it should be setClassThreshold instead.
Let's fix this before it's being used and break stuff in the future. The setter is setting classCount, so fixing this may not break already saved models like pre-trained model, but let's check before.
Another issue is that this doesn't exist on the Python side. Over there is called setClassCount. Let's either rename it in Scala or in Python to make them both be the same.
