	<summary>Databricks newer runtime versions and ML editions serialization issue</summary>
	<description>
Currently the following runtime versions on Databricks work:

6.2
6.3

However, the 6.4, or 6.5 beta plus every version with ML in 6.x are crashing with serialization issues.
Similar issues:

#772
#691
#679
#745

NOTE: Some might be related to YARN in cluster-mode but they all have one thing in common.
UPDATE 1: The issue has been identified and we are testing the changes on Databricks.
UPDATE 2: Successfully tested on Databricks runtimes:

6.2
6.2 ML (failed previously)
6.3
6.3 ML (failed previously)
6.4 (failed previously)
6.4 ML (failed previously)
6.5 (failed previously)
6.5 ML (failed previously)

UPDATE 3: Successfully tested on Cloudera YARN cluster-mode
Not supported runtime versions with Spark NLP 2.4.x:
NOTE: We move to TF 1.15.x and cross-platform solution for all TF related models, the following runtime versions are not compatible with TF 1.15.x. We assume anything beyond 6.0 is also not compatible with newer version of Spark NLP.

6.0
6.0 ML
6.1
6.1 ML
