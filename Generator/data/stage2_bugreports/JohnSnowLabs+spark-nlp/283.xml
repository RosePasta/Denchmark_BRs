	<summary>Wrong FS error while training NerCrfApproach</summary>
	<description>
I am facing two issues with the version 1.7.0 while training NerCrfApproach

I am not able to provide Embeddings from HDFS. I was able to do it with version 1.6.3
Now that I have provided the source files from the local file system, I am receiving following error while training.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o858.fit.
: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS: hdfs:/Users/bairathirahul/hadoop/hdfs/tmp/embeddings992fc2a603c4_idx2045865221115508142, expected: file:///


&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
