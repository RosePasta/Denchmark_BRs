	<summary>Root nodes have no neighbors on directed graphs</summary>
	<description>
Nodes with no in-degrees generate walks with only themselves - meaning they cannot be considered while traveling and this effects directed graphs.
To reproduce:
import networkx as nx
from node2vec import Node2Vec

DG = nx.DiGraph()
DG.add_edges_from([('1', '2'), ('2', '5'), ('2', '6'), ('3', '4'),
                   ('4', '5'), ('4', '6'), ('5', '7'), ('5', '8'),
                   ('6', '7'), ('6', '8'), ('7', '9'), ('8', '10')])

node2vec = Node2Vec(DG, dimensions=10, walk_length=10, num_walks=400, workers=1)
model = node2vec.fit(window=10)


for walk in node2vec.walks:
    if '1' in walk:
        print(walk)
Results in output of
['1']
['1']
['1']
['1']
