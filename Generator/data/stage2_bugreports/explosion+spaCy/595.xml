	<summary>Adding Lemmatizer Exceptions</summary>
	<description>
I tried to edit exceptions in spacy/data/en-1.1.0/wordnet/verb.exc but it didn't have any effect, spacy is still returning the old lemma. Is there some other way to fix or add the lemmatizer exceptions?

		Have you checked that the POS tag is being predicted correctly? The exceptions are POS-keyed, so they won't fire if the POS is incorrect.

		Yes, i'm looking for verbs and then for a lemma. Had a problem with a few words (like "Don't feed the dog" is returning lemma "fee" for feed.)
As past tense of fee is very unlikely in my case I went ahead and removed that exception. But SpaCy is still somehow returning "fee".
Is there some cache to rebuild wordnet?
This is an example code:
def get_main_verbs_of_sent(sent):
    """Return the main (non-auxiliary) verbs in a sentence."""
    return [tok for tok in sent
        if tok.pos == VERB and tok.dep_ not in {'aux', 'auxpass'}]

tdoc_itext = textacy.Doc("Don't feed the dog.", lang=u"en")
for sent in doc_itext.sents:
    itext_verbs = get_main_verbs_of_sent(sent)
    for verb in itext_verbs:
        print verb.text
        print verb.pos_
        print verb.lemma_
feed
verb
fee

		Thanks for the report â€” turned out to be a deeper problem.
"feed" is being assigned the tag VB, which means it shouldn't be lemmatized at all. The 'VB' tag is supposed to be associated with the morphological feature {verbform: inf}, in the tag map. This wasn't being set on the tokens, due to a bug in the morphological analyser (which is a bit of a mess).
Should be fixed now.
