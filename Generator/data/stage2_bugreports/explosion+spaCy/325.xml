	<summary>Named Entities ending with s are being lemmatized</summary>
	<description>
Named entities ending with s will be treated by the lemmatizer as if they are plurals, e.g.
Bernie Sanders turns into bernie sander, ISIS becomes isi, United States becomes united state. It probably also applies to other suffixes.
This may be intentional, so maybe adding a flag would be a good solution. Or is there another work around?
[Update] Somewhat related: when something like  is at the end of a sentence, the named entity becomes . My guess is that this is done to account for acronyms like , &lt;denchmark-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym#Punctuation&gt;but the trend seems to be to eliminate periods from acronyms&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so punctuation can probably be stripped from the Named Entity altogether (avoiding the inconsistency).
