	<summary>span.orth_ != span.text</summary>
	<description>
According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/api/span#attributes&gt;the API docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,  should be identical to , but that's not what I'm seeing:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import spacy

&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
&gt;&gt;&gt; doc = nlp('The black cat purrs.')
&gt;&gt;&gt; span = doc[1: 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; span.text
'black cat'
&gt;&gt;&gt; span.orth_
'blackcat'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When I peek into the source code, I see the difference: The text property joins the span's constituent tokens via u''.join([t.text_with_ws for t in self]), which includes trailing whitespace, while orth_ uses ''.join([t.orth_ for t in self]).strip(), which does not.
I could submit a PR for this â€” would you believe it, I've never submitted a PR here?! â€” but I don't know how you'd prefer the change to go.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Thanks! Not sure how this happened, but yes, Span.orth_ should match Span.text and include whitespace.

Yes, even for that reason alone you definitely should ðŸ˜œ
