	<summary>error when `Doc.to_disk()`</summary>
	<description>
I see the following error when I use multi-thread pipe + serialization. In &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101#lightning-tour-serialization&gt;spaCy 101&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it feeds a string for saving path but it doesn't work with me.

		Thanks for the report – this was an error in v2.0.2 (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1521&gt;#1521&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) ans has since been fixed in v2.0.3. So simply updating spaCy to the latest version should do the trick:
pip install -U spacy
Btw, if you're using conda, note that the latest version is not available via conda-forge just yet. Unfortunately, the conda builds always take a little longer – but it'll be there asap (as soon as the build is fixed an all tests pass).
