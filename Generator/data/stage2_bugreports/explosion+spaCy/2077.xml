	<summary>TypeError when calling similarity() with a loop including a single-letter token</summary>
	<description>
It seems that when iterating through a Doc containing a single-letter token (e.g. "I" or "a") and calling the similarity() method in a pairwise fashion, you get a TypeError:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tokens = nlp("a phrase")
&gt;&gt;&gt; for token1 in tokens:
...:    for token2 in tokens:
...:        print(token1.similarity(token2))

TypeError: 'spacy.tokens.token.Token' object does not support indexing
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This seems to have something to do with the loop, since the following works:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tokens[0].similarity(tokens[1])
0.26559153
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And it works if you get rid of the one-letter token:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tokens = nlp("an phrase")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is the first time I've tried opening an issue on an open source repo, so apologies if I did anything wrong, and feedback much appreciated.
Environment
spaCy 2.0.9
Python 3.6.3 (using Pyenv virtualenv)
Ubuntu 17.10

 I am facing the same issue with spaCy 2.0.9 and Python 3.6.3
What is the reason for this? And is there any workaround?

		This should have been fixed in  â€“ &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/releases/tag/v2.0.12&gt;see here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Fix issue #2219: Fix token similarity of single-letter tokens.
