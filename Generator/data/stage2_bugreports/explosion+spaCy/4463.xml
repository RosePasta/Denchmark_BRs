&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/gold.pyx#L539&gt;gold.pyx#L539&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it appears as if the static  function unpacks a tuple of length 7, but in the constructor &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/gold.pyx#L635&gt;gold.pyx#L635&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,  is populated with a length 6 tuple (discarding the cat annotation). This is creating a bug in the  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/scorer.py#L222&gt;score function&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where the gold object is reconstructed with  function. I discovered this bug when trying to override the cli train function.

		Thanks for the report! I must have missed this spot when adding cats in 2.2 and I'll look into it...
