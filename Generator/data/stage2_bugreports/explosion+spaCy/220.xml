	<summary>Whitespace as Noun</summary>
	<description>
Unsure if this is related to some of the other issues filed, but I'm having a problem with whitespace.
Here, two instances of '\r\n' in some messy email text are tokenized and tagged as nouns.
This is spaCy 0.99
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [27]: from spacy.en import English

In [28]: nlp = English()

In [29]: d = nlp(u'hi Aaron,\r\n\r\nHow is your schedule today, I was wondering if you had time for a phone\r\ncall this afternoon?\r\n\r\n\r\n')

In [30]: [(x.orth_, x.pos_) for x in d]
Out[32]:
[(u'hi', u'INTJ'),
 (u'Aaron', u'NOUN'),
 (u',', u'PUNCT'),
 (u'\r\n\r\n', u'NOUN'),   &lt;------- Issue
 (u'How', u'ADV'),
 (u'is', u'VERB'),
 (u'your', u'ADJ'),
 (u'schedule', u'NOUN'),
 (u'today', u'NOUN'),
 (u',', u'PUNCT'),
 (u'I', u'NOUN'),
 (u'was', u'VERB'),

 (u'phone', u'NOUN'),
 (u'\r\n', u'NOUN'),   &lt;------- Issue
 (u'call', u'NOUN'),
 (u'this', u'DET'),
 (u'afternoon', u'NOUN'),
 (u'?', u'PUNCT'),
 (u'\r\n\r\n\r\n', u'X')]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thanks for the minimal example! I've added this to the tests, and should have it fixed shortly.
