	<summary>ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence</summary>
	<description>
I was running spacy through some sentences and saw that the sentence below is throwing a ValuerError.
from spacy.en import English
spacy_nlp = English()
text = u'Talks given by women had a slightly higher number of questions asked (3.2$\pm$0.2) than talks given by men (2.6$\pm$0.1).'
tokens = spacy_nlp(text)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/spacy/en/init.py", line 195, in call
self.mwe_merger(tokens)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/spacy/multi_words.py", line 8, in call
tokens.merge(m.start(), m.end(), tag, m.group(), entity_type)
File "spacy/tokens.pyx", line 329, in spacy.tokens.Tokens.merge (spacy/tokens.cpp:6701)
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence
I have the newest spacy installed and up to date requirements.

		Thanks, I'll look into this.
In the meantime you can work around this by turning off the multi-word expression merging:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tokens = spacy_nlp(text, merge_mwes=False)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Fixed in v0.83. Be sure to redownload the data.
Note that v0.83 has merge_mwes=False by default, so if you do want the multi-word expressions, supply merge_mwes=True to English.call.
