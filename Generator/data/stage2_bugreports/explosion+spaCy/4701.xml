	<summary>'FeedForward' object has no attribute 'W' --When load a saved nlp model.</summary>
	<description>
I am training a TextCategories Pipeline by reference to spacy-transformers/blob/master/examples/train_textcat.py. The training process has been successfully completed and passed the test on the nlp object for training.
I used nlp.to_disk("mydir") to save the model and then use spacy.load("mydir") to loaded it as nlp2 and encountered an error.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last)
Pipes.pyx in spacy.pipeline.pipes.Pipe.from_disk.load_model()
E:\G\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\thinc\neural\_classes\model.py in from_bytes(self, bytes_data)
    374 name = name.decode("utf8")
--&gt; 375 dest = getattr(layer, name)
    376 copy_array(dest, param[b"value"])

AttributeError: 'FeedForward' object has no attribute 'W'
....

Pipes.pyx in spacy.pipeline.pipes.Pipe.from_disk.load_model()

ValueError: [E149] Error deserializing model. Check that the config used to create the component matches the model being loaded.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The code I used during training was as follows:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    Textcat = nlp.create_pipe("trf_textcat")#,config={"architecture": "softmax_last_hidden", "words_per_batch": max_wpb},)
    For v in labels: textcat.add_label(v)
    Nlp.add_pipe(textcat, last=True)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tried both config and default without using config, which is the same as loading.
I saw something similar in another issue, but I didn't understand the solution.
How can I try to solve this problem?
Thank you.
ADDING:
this train is based on 'en_trf_xlnetbasecased_lg' model

		Looks like a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spacy-transformers/issues/105&gt;explosion/spacy-transformers#105&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It's still a bug/incompatibility that should be fixed, but in the meanwhile, try the suggested package versions there?
