	<summary>Initialization in text</summary>
	<description>
In method from
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spacy/blob/master/examples/training/train_textcat.py&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spacy/blob/master/examples/training/train_textcat.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

tp, fp, fn, and tn (true positives etc) are initialized to 1e-8 (see below)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tp = 1e-8  # True positives
fp = 1e-8  # False positives
fn = 1e-8  # False negative
tn = 1e-8  # True negatives
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Why are the values not initlaized to 0? When there are no true positives the precision is 0.5, That doesn't seem right.

		Fair point --- I was avoiding the divide-by-zero error, but if there are no true or false positives, I guess the precision should be 0.0. It should be more correct to initialize tp and tn to 0.0, while fp and fn are initialized to a small value to avoid the denominator being zero.
Do you want to make a pull request?
