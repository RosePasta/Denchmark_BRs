	<summary>Error unpickling Matcher</summary>
	<description>
The Matcher.__reduce__ method passes incorrect attributes to Matcher.__init__. This causes unpickling the Matcher or copy.deepcopy to fail.

		Also fixed related error: the matcher._patterns attribute was storing the converted internal format, which includes implementation details about how the operators work. This format was being returned to users in matcher.get(), which isn't useful. We now correctly store the input patterns to the matcher in matcher._patterns, which also makes it easier to deserialize the matcher.
One thing to note here is that users have responsibility for making sure the callbacks they pass to the matcher can be pickled. It seems better to leave this error inplace instead of silently dropping the data.
