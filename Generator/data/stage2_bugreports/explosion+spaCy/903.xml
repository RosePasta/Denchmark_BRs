	<summary>Overzealous lemmatisation of -ss nouns</summary>
	<description>
The final -s is stripped even though the tag assigned is a singular noun (NN).
Some examples: sleepiness, incompleteness, loss, ass (unless they are recognised as proper nouns, which happens often if they are sentence-first).
A similar thing happens to nouns with other suffixes, e.g. anus ‚Üí anu.
Seen in Spacy 1.7.2, model en_depent_web_md-1.2.1.

		Damn. I know exactly what must have caused this :(
There's a base-form check in the lemmatizer --- if a word is listed as a base form, it shouldn't be lemmatized. Obviously this check is broken for nouns.

		Here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/lemmatizer.py#L52&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/lemmatizer.py#L52&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This looks up the enum symbols for the verb-forms, but misses the enum symbols for the nouns. We just need to list the morphological features that indicate the noun is a base form, and list them here.
We also need a regression test. I've got meetings today and most of tomorrow, so I'm hoping someone else can get the fix up? üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It will need a regression test too.
