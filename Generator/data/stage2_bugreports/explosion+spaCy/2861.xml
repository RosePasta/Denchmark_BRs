	<summary>Error Loading Model into spaCy</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I am trying load a spaCy model trained in a linux  Env to a Windows machine running spaCy. When I attempt to load the model from the model path I get the following:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31282809/47105040-de8ea480-d210-11e8-9be6-fa882d2eca63.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The model loads fine when I try it on the Linux machine where it was created.
The envs are as follows
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Windows Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Operating System:  Windows Server 2012 R2
Python Version Used:  Python 3.4.2
spaCy Version Used: spaCy 2.012
Environment Information:  Numpy 1.15.2

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Linux Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 Server
Python Version Used:  Python 3.4.2
spaCy Version Used: spaCy 2.012
Environment Information:  Numpy 1.15.2

I think it may be related to this issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1634&gt;#1634&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but am not positive.
Has anyone else experienced this?
Thanks!

		If this seems to be a common problem, I can submit a PR to try and fix it. I'll see if I can replicate the error on Windows 10.

		I was actually just working through this and it looks like the issue was mine.  I errantly had msgpack-numpy 0.4.4.1 installed and reverted to msgpack-numpy 0.4.3.2.  After reverting things appear to be in working order.
