	<summary>Trained NER models are not loadable</summary>
	<description>
I use some trained NER models to recognise entity names in some specific domains. After upgrading to v1.8.0, I found those models could not be loaded.
It is easy to reproduce the problem by add following code to the official example, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/examples/training/train_ner.py#L87&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/examples/training/train_ner.py#L87&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
    model_path = Path('./ner')
    ner2 = EntityRecognizer.load(model_path, nlp.vocab)
    doc = nlp.make_doc('Who is Shaka Khan?')
    nlp.tagger(doc)
    ner2(doc)
    for word in doc:
        print(word.text, word.orth, word.lower, word.tag_, word.ent_type_, word.ent_iob)
This will result in following error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "train_ner.py", line 104, in &lt;module&gt;
    main('ner')
  File "train_ner.py", line 94, in main
    ner2 = EntityRecognizer.load(model_path, nlp.vocab)
  File "spacy/syntax/parser.pyx", line 149, in spacy.syntax.parser.Parser.load (spacy/syntax/parser.cpp:6845)
KeyError: 'actions'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seems ner.cfg["actions"] is not necessary for NER training, but the loading code will read it anyway.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Info about spaCy&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


spaCy version: 1.8.0
Platform: Linux-4.10.0-19-generic-x86_64-with-debian-8.7

		Closing this and making &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1046&gt;#1046&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the master issue. Work in progress for spaCy v2.0!

		Anyone found a workaround to load trained NER models in spacy &lt;2.0 ?
