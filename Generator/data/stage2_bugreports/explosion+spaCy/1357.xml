	<summary>spacy.set_factory is not defined in V2</summary>
	<description>
In researching/writing a response to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1105&gt;#1105&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I was trying to get factory components working but haven't been able to.  To that end I don't see any mention of set_factory in the code base.  Has it be implemented yet?

		I'm still not thrilled about the factory stuff.
Maybe we should just accept having pipeline-specific load() functions? Then we could move the pipeline assembly out of the Language.__init__ altogether.
