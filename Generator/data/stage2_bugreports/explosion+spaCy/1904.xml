	<summary>Dummy command argument wasn't removed from auto-link after download</summary>
	<description>
Auto-linking of downloaded languages was broken in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/commit/7f0ab145e95036a55af4802184a4b1c496557d0a&gt;7f0ab14&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The dummy argument wasn't removed from the  call at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/cli/download.py#L44&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/cli/download.py#L44&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I can make a PR for the fix unless it's easier for a maintainer to just fix this quickly.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Thanks ‚Äì I thought this was fixed in a second PR, but it might have been lost in an unclean merge in between, damn. If you could submit a quick PR, that would be great! üëç
