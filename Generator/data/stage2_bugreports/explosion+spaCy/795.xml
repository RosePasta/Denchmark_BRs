	<summary>token.conjuncts does not return conjuncts of conjuncts</summary>
	<description>
If you have the sentence:
"The boy and the girl and the man went to the store."
boy.conjuncts will only return girl, and girl.conjuncts will not return anything. Seems to be caused by
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/e7f8e13cf3740487e557beec52c26233847da9a9/spacy/tokens/token.pyx#L480&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Personally i would expect:
boy.conjuncts -&gt; [girl]
girl.conjuncts -&gt; [man]
I think the only requirements are that the elements are connected by a coordinating conjunction, with no restriction on either element being a conjunction themselves.

Operating System: Ubuntu
Python Version Used: 2.7

		I think I was intending for
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;boy.conjuncts -&gt; [boy, girl, man]
girl.conjuncts -&gt; [boy, girl, man]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think it's nice to get all of the conjuncts.

		makes sense, so calling conjuncts on any element of a continuous sequence of dependent conjuncts returns the whole sequence, in order of dependence, including itself. If you agree I can do a PR sometime this week.

		"I like apples, oranges and bananas."
[ i for i in doc[2].conjuncts] --&gt; returns only  [ oranges ]
[ i for i in doc[4].conjuncts] --&gt; returns nothing
