	<summary>Wrong lemmatization of words with -ed ending in basic form</summary>
	<description>
Lemmatization in the english model of Spacy wrongly removes ed ending from words that have it in their basic form:

need &gt; ne
feed &gt; fee
bleed &gt; ble

It would be nice if such words were properly taken into account by the lemmatizer.

		Thanks, I'm not sure when this regression was introduced. I could've sworn we had tests for this.
