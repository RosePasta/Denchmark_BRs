&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In , we ask for  and in  for . As &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plac&gt;plac 0.9.6 is released&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, if we start by a  then , we get a conflicting version error.
As a side note, in requirements.txt we don't have a version requirement for ujson, but we do in setup.py (ujson&gt;=1.35). It would be great to change this too.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
