	<summary>Updated version of plac breaks spacy.en.download.</summary>
	<description>
Looks like python plac has been updated and is breaking the model download. Inside the spaCy requirements.txt file a version for plac hasn't been specified and it appears like the latest version of plac isn't backwards compatible (I haven't dug into this at all).
However, with a fresh install of spaCy (which succeeded) and then downloading the model via python -m spacy.en.download, the following error results:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 162, in _run_module_as_main
    "__main__", fname, loader, pkg_name)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 72, in _run_code
    exec code in run_globals
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/spacy/en/download.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    import plac
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/plac.py", line 38, in &lt;module&gt;
    from plac_tk import TkMonitor
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/plac_tk.py", line 46
    print('Process %d killed by CTRL-C' % os.getpid(), file=sys.stderr)
                                                           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, this problem can be worked around if I specify plac==-0.9.1 in my own requirements.txt file.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;plac==0.9.1
spacy==0.101.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I investigated a bit. Until &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/micheles/plac/issues/17&gt;micheles/plac#17&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is fixed I think spaCy should require  (eg 0.9.2) to avoid the last version which has a universal wheel that only works on Python 3.
