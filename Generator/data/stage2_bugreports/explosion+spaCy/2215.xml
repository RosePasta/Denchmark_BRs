	<summary>`pipe(...)` only POS tags the final item?</summary>
	<description>
I've been using pipe(...) to process a sequence of texts in parallel, but I recently noticed that only the final document is POS tagged:
import spacy
sp = spacy.load('en')
[print(p) for p in sp.pipeline]

for doc in sp.pipe(['Sentence 1.', 'Sentence 2.', 'Sentence 3.']):
    print('txt: "{}", parsed: {}, tagged: {}'.format(
        doc, doc.is_parsed, doc.is_tagged))
outputs:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;('tagger', &lt;spacy.pipeline.Tagger object at 0x7fba7f55c748&gt;)
('parser', &lt;spacy.pipeline.DependencyParser object at 0x7fba7f44c468&gt;)
('ner', &lt;spacy.pipeline.EntityRecognizer object at 0x7fba7f44c4c0&gt;)
txt: "Sentence 1.", parsed: True, tagged: False
txt: "Sentence 2.", parsed: True, tagged: False
txt: "Sentence 3.", parsed: True, tagged: True
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I run this over 20 items, only the last 1 is tagged.
However, if I run this over 10,000 items, 10 get tagged (they are widely spread apart).
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Operating System: Ubuntu (same result on macOS)

python -m spacy info --markdown on Ubuntu:

spaCy version: 2.0.11
Platform: Linux-4.4.0-116-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid
Python version: 3.6.2
Models: en, en_core_web_lg

		Thanks for the report – I'm pretty sure this was caused by an unfortunate typo that would cause  to not be set correctly. We've already fixed this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/commit/5ecb274764b085bd6fe49fcc573618e430051259&gt;5ecb274&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The fix is also included in the current development release – so if you want, you could test it with v2.0.12.dev0 and see if the problem is resolved?
pip install spacy==v2.0.12.dev0
