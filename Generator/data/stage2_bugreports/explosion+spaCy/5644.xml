&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since a few days, I'm running into a CORS issue while accessing the &lt;denchmark-link:https://explosion.ai/demos/matcher&gt;interactive matcher explorer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The issue is persistent on any browser, device, OS, ...
Is this a known issue?

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Operating System: MacOS, Windows
Browser: Any

Thanks for the report, that does look like a bug! We'll look into it.

Thank you for your effort. This tool is incredibly useful for adjusting complex match patterns.
Some follow up info: All demos on &lt;denchmark-link:https://explosion.ai/software#demos&gt;https://explosion.ai/software#demos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seem to be affected. Accessing /*/models (e.g., &lt;denchmark-link:https://api.explosion.ai/matcher/models&gt;https://api.explosion.ai/matcher/models&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) returns 502 Bad Gateway.
Please don't hesitate to let me know what I can do to help in tracking down this issue. Cheers!

		Having the same issue.
Is there any way to use the demo meanwhile, maybe locally?

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/svlandeg&gt;@svlandeg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the code for the matcher on the GitHub too? I couldn't find it

		I donâ€˜t believe the code for the matcher demo is open source... &lt;denchmark-link:https://support.prodi.gy/t/rules-gui/2629/4&gt;https://support.prodi.gy/t/rules-gui/2629/4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Any update on a fix, or some way to avoid this issue? Is only a portion of users affected?

		We're working on a fix, and it's high up the priority list, but obviously not the only thing on that list ;-)
As a "workaround", you can just run the matcher from code: &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching&gt;https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you want visualisations, you can run &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers#ent&gt;displacy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 locally with .
