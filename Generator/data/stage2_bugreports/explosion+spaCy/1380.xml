		Thanks. Btw the workflow for bugs is that we should always have a regression test file like spacy/tests/regression/test_issue1380.py. The test should fail, and then a commit fixing it should close the issue. So, if you have time/energy in future, a simple way to help out is to submit bug reports via PR with a failing test :)
