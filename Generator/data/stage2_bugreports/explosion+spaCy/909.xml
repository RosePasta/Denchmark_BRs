	<summary>Model symlinks not working on Windows (Python 2.7)</summary>
	<description>
It's not exactly spaCy's fault. It looks like it's a pathlib problem creating symlinks on Windows.
Anyway, on a fairly fresh Win2k8 (an Amazon workspaces desktop, in fact) pip install spacy works as long as the compiler is in place.
python -m spacy download en  fails with the following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):

I've written up a solution over here: &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42914239/spacy-english-model-install-is-failing&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42914239/spacy-english-model-install-is-failing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think what's going wrong is that pathlib's symlink function doesn't work correctly on Windows.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Thanks for the report and getting to the bottom of this!
That's pretty annoying... just did a quick search and there seem to be some &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6260149/os-symlink-support-in-windows&gt;general problems&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with symlinks and Python 2 on Windows. So we might need to add a little Windows-only workaround. Unfortunately, we don't have a good Windows testing environment at the moment, so I'll be tagging this as "help wanted" in case one of our Windows users wants to give this a go in the meantime (would be much appreciated!).
