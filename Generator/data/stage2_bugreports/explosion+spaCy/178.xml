	<summary>Loading custom gazetteer data breaks existing entity matching?</summary>
	<description>
For instance,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;a = nlp(u"get me a flight leaving 20th December and arriving on January 5th")
[(i.text, i.label_) for i in a.ents]
[(u'20th December', u'DATE'), (u'January 5th', u'DATE')]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Now, if I were to load a custom gazetteer that contains airport codes,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;a = nlp(u"get me a flight from SFO to LAX leaving 20 December and arriving on January 5th")

[(i.text, i.label_) for i in a.ents]
[(u'SFO', u'AIRPORT'), (u'LAX', u'AIRPORT')]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Why would the dates vanish?

		Thanks for the report on this. I fixed a different bug related to the interaction between the entity recogniser and the matcher, but I think this seems to be unrelated. Will investigate and let you know.

		Sorry for the delay on this. Should be fixed in master, and rolled out onto pip soon.  See Issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/217&gt;#217&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Just pushed v0.100, which should have this fixed. If you have any problems, please reopen this and let us know.
