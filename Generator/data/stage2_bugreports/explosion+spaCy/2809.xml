	<summary>RuntimeWarning when numpy is not imported</summary>
	<description>
I was trying the TextCategorizer example (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spacy/blob/master/examples/training/train_textcat.py&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spacy/blob/master/examples/training/train_textcat.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) with offline IMDB dataset. Hence I removed the import thinc.extra.datasets. That's when I started getting the following warning:
RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in sqrt ret = sqrt(sqnorm)
After analyzing I figured out that I need to import numpy before spaCy. It's kind of confusing when someone does not need numpy in there code.

		Thanks! I did not know that was the cause of that error. We could import numpy at the top of the spaCy or Thinc __init__.py, to make sure this doesn't occur?

		I've added this fix to Thinc: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/thinc/commit/a82da48d910b64a762b50619eb75d05e91ddaadc&gt;explosion/thinc@a82da48&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
