	<summary>load_vectors should accept arbitrary space characters as word tokens</summary>
	<description>
This bug is similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/737&gt;#737&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Some space characters (such as the NO-BREAK SPACE U+00A0) are currently not detected as space by the load_vectors function, and the loading fails if the word vector files has such strings as token.
I fixed the bug by detecting the  expression at the beginning of each line, instead of '  '.
I submitted a PR (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/836&gt;#836&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
