	<summary>Check equality of Lexemes</summary>
	<description>
How to check if two lexemes are equal? I get the following behaviour, which I find odd:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cat1 = nlp.vocab['cat']

cat2 = nlp.vocab['cat']

cat1 == cat2

False
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think cat1.orth == cat2.orth would work, but then one still cannot add Lexemes to sets, dicts, etc.

		Thanks! Fixed. In the meantime you can do cat1.orth == cat2.orth

		That was quick, many thanks!
One more question regarding the fix: for isinstance(other, str), shouldn't it be a = self.orth_ (orth with underscore)? And how would string comparison match the statement in the test_lexeme_lt test case that says that '''More frequent is l.t. less frequent'''?
