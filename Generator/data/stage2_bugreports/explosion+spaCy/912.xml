	<summary>Unexpected lemma: "inner" -&amp;gt; "inn"</summary>
	<description>
I've previously (in other lemmatization software) seen "inner" -&gt; "inner" (but again, not sure what correct lemma is, only that "inn" seems wrong here).
I did notice some tasks for improving lemmatization in Spacy in future though, so can hold off on reporting lemmatization issues if it's not helpful at the moment.
Example case:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en')
for token in nlp("Wearing inners in the innermost inner space in the inn."):
    print(token, token.lemma_)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Wearing wear
inners inner
in in
the the
innermost innermost
inner inn
space space
in in
the the
inn inn
. .
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
