&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Created a custom NER model the cfg file is showing my entities multiple times
"extra_labels":[
"PAY",
"PAY",
"PAY",
"PAY",
"CPTI",
"CPTI",
"CPTI",
"CPTI",
"CHG_Amts",
"CHG_Amts",
"CHG_Amts",
"CHG_Amts"
],

		I suspect that This might be due to your data format of list of list as you showed in#3120.
Can you try with list of tuple to see if it helps.
Otherwise share more details on the code you run to get this

		My training set is a local json file to read it in I deserialize using the following
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;with open(localFilePath,encoding='utf-8') as f:
     data = json.load(f)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I convert to a list of tuples this fails
I re-checked the code  where I add the labels
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;      for _, annotations in trainData:
           for ent in annotations.get('entities'):
               ner.add_label(ent[2])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

ent[2] = 'PAY' so this seems correct ?
Have you any examples of a local json file of training data ?

		Looks like this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/2179&gt;#2179&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It should be fixed in the latest  already â€“ you can install the latest release from pip and rerun your code to check

		I don't know I am thinking that maybe their is something wrong with my representation as the issue in  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/3120&gt;#3120&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, seems to suggest their is something going on.
By any chance have you any examples of a local file of training data being deserialized, it would really help, even better if you have any that are compatible with json.load()

		I reworked the format changing the lists to tuples &amp; it made no difference
