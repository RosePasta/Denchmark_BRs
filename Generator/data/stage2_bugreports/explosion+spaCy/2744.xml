	<summary>spaCy loops indefinetly during parsing of a typo ridden sentence</summary>
	<description>
While trying to parse a large file with multiple tweets I found one which is completely typo ridden (using punctuation instead of spaces, mispellings, etc.), this specific text chain causes spaCy tokenizer to loop indefinetly.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("es_core_news_sm")
doc = nlp(u'Me pongo alas vivas.por favor vendan alitas.de pavo.piernas.huacales.crudos.va.colitas.rostizadas.como.en.cd.juarez.chihuagua.va.gracias.')
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Operating System: Windows 10-10.0.1734-SP0
Python Version Used: 3.6.6
spaCy Version Used: 2.0.11
Environment Information: Models: "es"

		Thanks for the example! We need to make a test case for this, and then look into it.

		Just tested this with the new spacy-nightly and the new models and it works as expected now. This was likely related to an issue with the TOKEN_MATCH, which was resolved for the new version.
