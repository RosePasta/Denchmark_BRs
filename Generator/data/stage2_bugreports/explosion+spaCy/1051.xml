	<summary>Misleading message trying to download non-existing model</summary>
	<description>
I get a misleading error executing the following script code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from spacy.es import Spanish

nlp = Spanish(path=None)

doc = nlp(u'Hola esto es una prueba de la librer√≠a Spacy en Espa√±ol.')
sentence = next(doc.sents)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After that, the error tells me to download a non-existing model, as it is shown below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "spacy/tokens/doc.pyx", line 434, in __get__ (spacy/tokens/doc.cpp:9664)
ValueError: sentence boundary detection requires the dependency parse, which requires data to be installed. If you haven't done so, run: 
python -m spacy download es
to install the data
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Running python -m spacy download es in command line the message tell me
es does not existing as model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python -m spacy download es

    Compatibility error

    No compatible model found for 'es' (spaCy v1.8.2).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

SpaCy should have checked for available models, or simply pointed to the models documentation instead.

		Thanks for the report ‚Äì this will definitely be fixed in the next version! üëç
(Also, as I mentioned on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43918886/error-downloading-spanish-model-in-spacy/43922477#comment74896955_43922477&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/docs/api/language-models&gt;language models docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should probably be more explicit about what "alpha support" really means, i.e. that it refers to the tokenizer and  class and not to alpha models etc. I think even renaming the section to "Languages" and adding a note to the alpha section will help here. Will update this as well!)

		even while downloading language models for english language I get the same error

python -m spacy download 'en_depent_web_md'

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Compatibility error

No compatible model found for ''en_depent_web_md'' (spaCy v1.9.0).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Has this been fixed in spaCy 1.9.0? I just got this error:
$ python -m spacy download en_vectors_web_lg
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Compatibility error

No compatible model found for 'en_vectors_web_lg' (spaCy v1.9.0).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Not sure where the compatibility applies - where do I look?

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/colingoldberg&gt;@colingoldberg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 spaCy's  command fetches the compatibility table from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/blob/master/compatibility.json&gt;spacy-models/compatibility.json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It seems like the model you're looking for is  (which was renamed to  in v2.0+ for consistency).

		Thanks for your response. I have upgraded to the latest spaCy version, and with a 'python -m spacy download en' it seems to be ok.
