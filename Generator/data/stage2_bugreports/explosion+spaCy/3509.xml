	<summary>Can't parse after merge?</summary>
	<description>
The parser raises a ValueError when used after a span in the doc has been merged. The message is either one of these two:

cannot resize this array: it does not own its data
all the input array dimensions except for the concatenation axis must match exactly

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
parser = nlp.pipeline[1][1]
assert isinstance(parser, spacy.pipeline.DependencyParser)

doc = nlp('Henry V is the best.', disable=['parser'])
parser(doc) # works

doc = nlp('Henry V is the best.', disable=['parser'])
doc[0:2].merge()
parser(doc) 
# ValueError: all the input array dimensions except for the concatenation axis must match exactly
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		This should be fixed in v2.1. The bug was that we didn't resize the tensors during merge. If you install v2.1 you should find it fixed.
