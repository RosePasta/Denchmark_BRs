	<summary>Language.save_to_directory fails if the path is a string</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
The documentation says that the path argument in the Language.save_to_directory method can be a string. However, this methods fails in such case:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "lib/python3.6/site-packages/spacy/language.py", line 353, in save_to_directory
    self.setup_directory(path, **configs)
File "lib/python3.6/site-packages/spacy/language.py", line 192, in setup_directory
    directory = path / name
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It works fine if the argument is a pathlib's Path.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Hmm, this is interesting! Could you share how you're calling save_to_directory(), i.e. the value you're passing in?
spaCy currently uses an &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/util.py#L43&gt;ensure_path() helper function&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that should make sure string types are turned into pathlib paths. But somehow, this seems to fail here and returns a string...

		Oh, I see - I was using the version from pip, and it does not call ensure_path in save_to_directory, whereas the version from github uses it.
I'll close the issue then.
Thanks!

		Oh, I didn't realise this was a fix we hadn't released as part of v1.8.0 yet. The next point release will hopefully be up on pip later tonight! Sorry about the confusion.
