	<summary>'before' and 'after' keywords do the same thing when adding custom pipeline components</summary>
	<description>
I'm currently trying to build a custom spacy pipeline, but have run into an issue when trying to order the components. Given two custom components, A and B defined as classes with names A and B respectively, if I add them to the pipeline as follows
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;nlp.add_pipe(A(), after='ner')
nlp.add_pipe(B(), after='A')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and then print the pipe names using print(nlp.pipe_names), the result I get is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;['tagger', 'parser', 'B', 'A', 'ner']
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, if I change things so that B set its before keyword as A like below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;nlp.add_pipe(A(), after='ner')
nlp.add_pipe(B(), after='A')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

then I get the same output from print(nlp.pipe_names), namely
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;['tagger', 'parser', 'B', 'A', 'ner']
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

again. I assume this isn't the intended behaviour?
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Thanks for the report â€“ I was kinda worried at first, but I noticed you're using spaCy v2.0.3. I'm pretty sure the issue you're experiencing is related to this bug: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1654&gt;#1654&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 It has since been fixed, so you should be able to upgrade to the latest version (v2.0.6, which was just released yesterday).
