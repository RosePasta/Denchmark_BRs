	<summary>Extra space within doc.text method</summary>
	<description>
An unexpected space was added within the doc.text.
code as below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp=spacy.load('en', add_vectors=False)
&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp(u"aaabbb@ccc.com\nThank you!").text
u'aaabbb@ccc.com \nThank you!'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that there is a space before \n which was not there in the input. This caused incorrect position of tokens when I tried to map to original text
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Thanks for the report -- bad bug. Will try to get this fixed shortly. In the meantime I think the error relates to the recent URL regex changes.

		Recently \n keeps being a token which is a bit strange for me.
See this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;repr(nlp(u"Hi\nThank you!")[1])
'\n'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Non-trivial whitespace has always been a token in spaCy -- I figured you'd have noticed this before. Is something new here that I'm not understanding?

		Hm, interesting, somehow I did not noticed this behaviour before. I guess my previous comment is useless in this case.
