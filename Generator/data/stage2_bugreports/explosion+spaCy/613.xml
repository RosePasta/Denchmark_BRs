	<summary>ValueError in PhraseMatcher.__call__</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
Using spacy PhraseMatcher now gives error due to deprecated use of acceptor keyword in Matcher. Here is a simple example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import spacy
from spacy.matcher import PhraseMatcher

nlp = spacy.load("en")

MWEs = [u"machine-learning"]
vocab = nlp.tokenizer.vocab
matcher = PhraseMatcher(vocab=vocab, phrases=[], max_length=6)

for mwe in MWEs:
    phrase = nlp.tokenizer(mwe)
    matcher.add(phrase)

s = u"machine-learning is used for predictive analytics"
doc = nlp(s)
matcher(doc)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It results in:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "spacy/matcher.pyx", line 509, in spacy.matcher.PhraseMatcher.__call__ (spacy/matcher.cpp:11800)
  File "spacy/matcher.pyx", line 344, in spacy.matcher.Matcher.__call__ (spacy/matcher.cpp:8013)
ValueError: acceptor keyword argument to Matcher deprecated. Specify acceptor functions when you add patterns instead.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Looking at both class Matcher and PhraseMatcher, the __call__ method of PhraseMatcher calls the __call__ method of Matcher with acceptor=self.accept_match, which seems deprecated.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		I think this should be fixed now, by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/614&gt;#614&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please reopen if it's not.

		Is this supposed to be fixed in 1.2.0? I'm experiencing the same error. I even tried the OP's exact code snippet and also received the same error.

		Nope this fix isn't in the 1.2.0 release, the issue was opened just after it. I guess it will be in the next one. In the meantime If you clone the code on the master and install it manually, it works :)
