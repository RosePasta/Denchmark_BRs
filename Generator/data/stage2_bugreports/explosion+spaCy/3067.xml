	<summary>ðŸ’« Vector names not handled correctly by package command</summary>
	<description>
First reported &lt;denchmark-link:https://support.prodi.gy/t/issue-with-exported-spacy-models/999/3&gt;on the Prodigy forum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

You were right, that was caused by wrong meta.json, which was generated after spacy package ... --create-meta, without vector names: "vectors":{ "width":XYZ, "vectors":XYZ, "keys":XYZ} . I compared that with meta.json automatically generated from prodigy textcat.batch-train ... en_core_web_md  where vector info is stored in following format: "vectors":{... , "name":"en_core_web_md.vectors"} 
I just copied automatically generated meta.json, changed model name to my unique and was able to load my custom model with vectors inside prodigy commands :)

This caused the following error:

OSError: [E050] Canâ€™t find model 'en_core_web_lg.vectors'. It doesnâ€™t seem to be a shortcut link, a Python package or a valid path to a data directory.
