	<summary>Empty specs accepted by matcher.add_pattern, but cause error</summary>
	<description>
From Issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/429&gt;#429&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
import spacy
import spacy.matcher

nlp = spacy.load('en', parser=False, entity=False)
matcher = spacy.matcher.Matcher(nlp.vocab)
content = u'''a b; c'''
matcher.add(entity_key='1', label='TEST', attrs={}, specs=[[]])
matcher(nlp(content))
-&gt;

Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File "word2vec/matcher_bla.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    matcher(nlp(content))
  File "spacy/matcher.pyx", line 315, in spacy.matcher.Matcher.__call__ (spacy/matcher.cpp:8519)
Exception: Error selecting action in matcher

Caused by empty specs. While I understand that this is a mistake in my data it's better to check this when entity is being added.
