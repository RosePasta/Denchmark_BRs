	<summary>Pickle issues with the Language</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I recently attempted pickling a language model, and....
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import pickle
nlp = spacy.load("de", tagger=False, entity=False, matcher=False, parser=False)
pickle.dumps(nlp)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/libs/python/dl/lib/python3.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py", line 2910, in run_code
    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
  File "&lt;ipython-input-54-28ffccf698b6&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    pickle.dumps(nlp)
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'FeatureExtracter.&lt;locals&gt;.feature_extracter_fwd'

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;** Environment**:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Spacy: 2.0.8
Python: 3.6.4
OS: Ubuntu

		Thanks for the report and sorry about that – looks like this is the same problem as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/2121&gt;#2121&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We've already fixed the underlying cause in Thinc – we just need to test and publish the point release.
