	<summary>error while creating a model for new language</summary>
	<description>
I have created everything needed for a language using spacy-dev-resources and everything worked well till creating brown vector files, the next command is to create a model out of what i have generated till now
here is the command
python -m spacy init-model  lang ././data/model/lang/vocab ./data/model/lang/lang_wiki.freqs ./data/model/lang/brown/paths ./data/model/lang/lang_wiki.word2vec.bz2
But it throw the error as below,
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 174, in run_module_as_main
"main", fname, loader, pkg_name)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 72, in run_code

return cls(*obj)
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/plac_core.py", line 78, in init

AssertionError: f
tried all possible options like setting up again on python3 and retrain the model but still the same issue

		Sorry about this â€“ I think this is actually related to a bug in the command arguments (a mismatched abbreviation of the argument). The issue has already been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/1710&gt;#1710&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and will be included in the next release. In the meantime, you can just make the same edit to  and it should work.
