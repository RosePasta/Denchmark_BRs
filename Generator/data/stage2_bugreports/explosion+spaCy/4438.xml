	<summary>Wrong Wikidata dump format references in `wikidata_pretrain_kb.py`</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run bin/wiki_entity_linking/wikidata_pretrain_kb.py: steps 1-3 runs with no issues;
Step 4 raises an error while reading the Wikidata dumps file:
OSError: Not a gzipped file (b'BZ')
This is because the docstring at the beginning of the script suggests to download the dumps in bz2 format:
For the Wikidata dump: get the latest-all.json.bz2 from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/
However, the script expects them to be in gz and uses the gzip library to open them.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
