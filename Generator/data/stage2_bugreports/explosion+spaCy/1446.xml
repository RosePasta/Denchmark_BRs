	<summary>ðŸ’« Check status code on calls to malloc, calloc</summary>
	<description>
Most of the memory allocations in spaCy are made through cymem, but there's some places in spacy/syntax/nn_parser.pyx and spacy/parser/_beam_utils.pyx where we make raw calls to calloc. When making these calls, the status code needs to be checked, in case the user is out of memory. Currently some of these checks are missing, leading to segmentation faults instead of graceful errors.
