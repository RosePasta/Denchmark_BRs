	<summary>Tokenizer default URL pattern may be slow</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Tokenizer may be extremely slow due to positive lookbehind. See example in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/4362&gt;#4362&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Tokenizer performance could be improved by including with multiple token_match options, one with the highest priority and one that allows prefixes and suffixes.
