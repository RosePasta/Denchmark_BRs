	<summary>ValueError: shapes (7,0) and (300,128) not aligned: 0 (dim 1) != 300 (dim 0)</summary>

Hello
I'm using new Spacy (2.0.5) for NER extraction. I'm testing NER using both 'en', 'en_core_web_md' and 'en_core_web_lg'.
For models 'en_core_web_md' and 'en_core_web_lg', I can run one time and load the models, but after some executions I started to have the error below.
Can you help me with this?
ops.pyx in thinc.neural.ops.NumpyOps.batch_dot()
ValueError: shapes (7,0) and (300,128) not aligned: 0 (dim 1) != 300 (dim 0)
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


spaCy version: 2.0.5
Platform: Darwin-16.7.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version: 3.6.3
Models: en, en-large, en-lg, en-md, en_core_web_md

		Thanks for the report. I think this is the same error as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1660&gt;#1660&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , so closing this to keep the discussion in one place.
