	<summary>spark does not utilize all cores when running a spacy parse or dies in serialization code</summary>
	<description>
I have some worker function which use spacy to parse the documents sent to them, on using spacy it only uses a single core of the system , without spacy all cores are utilized?
It means that only one worker is being run at a time.

		I'm going to close this for now because the issue is old, and this type of error is very tough to reproduce. If it's still occurring, please reopen and we'll try to figure out what's up.
