	<summary>Attempting autocomplete on a token in repl spawns endless Deprecation Warnings</summary>
	<description>
Hitting tab in a Python REPL on a token to see the list of the attributes infinitely spawns the "Token.sent_start is now deprecated" warning. Issue seems to be because of the threading module as seen from the trace.
