	<summary>Token offsets wrong after leading spaces</summary>
	<description>
When analyzing a text with leading spaces the offsets of the tokens are off by 1.
Example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from spacy.en import English
english_spacy = English()

# this works

text1 = u"This is a cat."
a = english_spacy(text1)

tok0 = list(a.sents)[0][0]
print tok0, tok0.idx, text1[tok0.idx]

tok1 = list(a.sents)[0][1]
print tok1, tok1.idx, text1[tok1.idx]

print "=="

# this does not work

text2 = u"   This is a cat."
b = english_spacy(text2)

tok0 = list(b.sents)[0][0]
print tok0, tok0.idx, text2[tok0.idx]

tok1 = list(b.sents)[0][1]
print tok1, tok1.idx, text2[tok1.idx]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;This 0 T
is 5 i
==
   0  
This 2  
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In the second example with the 3 leading spaces the index of the second token "This" should be 3, not 2.
