	<summary>Issue with doc.from_array</summary>
	<description>
I've been following the tutorial here, specifically my own dependency parsing and I've come across some unexpected behaviour, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Ogaday/f06bf048f29a03598e90a263269cedc9&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. On running I occasionally get a  printed to the terminal after printing. The final statement in the gist raises an .
I've had a brief look at the source, but I can't see the issue and thought I would share it while I look further.
More info:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;spacy 0.100.7 py35_0  (conda)
python 3.5.2 (conda)
Ubuntu-Mate 16.04 Xenial
Intel Core i3-5005U CPU @ 2GHz
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thanks for any advice.

		Hi,
Sorry for the delay getting to this. Could you update to 0.101.0, and try again? You'll need to do:
pip install -U spacy==0.101.0 &amp;&amp; python -m spacy.en.download --force
If it's still a problem, report back?
