	<summary>Where did Doc.from_orth go?</summary>
	<description>
In spacy/tokens/doc.pyx :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Doc.__init__(self, Vocab vocab, orths_and_spaces=None):
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

orths_and_spaces doesn't appear to do anything.
I'm puzzled, since &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/docs/tutorials/byo-annotations&gt;https://spacy.io/docs/tutorials/byo-annotations&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says that  is deprecated in favour of the  version.
(btw :  spaCy looks wonderful!  I'm just having a few teething troubles...)

		This slipped between the cracks while I was refactoring. Sorry!

If I construct a Doc explicitly (my own tokenization, probably the same as spaCy, but can't absolutely guarantee it), I notice that doing :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;spacy_nlp.tagger(doc)
spacy_nlp.entity(doc)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

finds more entities than if I just call .entity(doc).  Presumably, the NER uses the tags as NER boundary hints, etc.
Would NER performance be improved (or changed in any way) if I also include spacy_nlp.parser(doc) in the pipeline?  i.e.  Does the NER make use of dependency information?

		The current NER model doesn't use the dependency parse, no. I've always
meant to try that, but never got around to it.

		The orths_and_spaces argument is now fixed, and the fix will be released in 1.0.
