	<summary>Span Merge with keyword arguments</summary>
	<description>
Merging spans with keyword arguments does not work.
Looking at 


spaCy/spacy/tokens/doc.pyx


         Line 622
      in
      6c15cf4






 lemma = self.vocab.strings[attributes.get(LEMMA, span.root.lemma)] 





if you want to use a keyword argument to set the lemma, you have to use the key attrs.LEMMA. However, the value of that is 73. Python does not allow numeric keys and putting the key into a dict and using the ** operator (eg myspan.merge(**{spacy.attrs.LEMMA:"new_lemma"}) throws a type error.

		This is fixed in 2.0 (on develop branch). If you want you could port the fix over? It doesn't rely on other changes.

		Thanks for the quick response! It's not a big issue so I won't bother porting the fix. Using the three parameters interface (which I guess will be deprecated soon) is a workaround for now. I can switch to keyword args when I update to 2.0.
