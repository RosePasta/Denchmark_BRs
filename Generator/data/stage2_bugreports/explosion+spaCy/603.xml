Hi, is this issue resolved? I just tried pip install -U spacy today on Windows 10, Python 2.7, Anaconda and got the same issue. If not, is there an older version of spacy that can still be installed? Thanks!

		Hi,
This error message is displayed on most types of compilation failures, so it's not a clean symptom. I think there are current compilation problems on Windows, due to compiler versioning.
I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/741&gt;#741&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the best active issue on this. A good start is to try installing from source, so we can look at a proper log. If you have time to debug this, updating &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/741&gt;#741&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 would be appreciated.
If you need to just get started, you should find the most recent version for which binary wheels are available.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/honnibal&gt;@honnibal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have updated 741 with my recent attempt from source, hope it helps. In the meantime, do you know where I can find the binary wheels?
