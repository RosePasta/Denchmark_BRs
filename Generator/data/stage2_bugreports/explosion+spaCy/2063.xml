	<summary>Conjugation tag is being lemmatized: also becomes conjurer</summary>
	<description>
The word "also" becomes "conjurer" when lemmatized. Obviously the conjugation tag is being lemmatized not the word. Try this:



import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en')
pdoc = nlp("this is also three times also also")
pdoc = nlp(u"this is also three times also also")
for ii in pdoc:
print ii.lemma_



You get:
this
be
conjurer
three
time
conjurer
conjurer

		I'm on Ubuntu 17.04 Zesty and Python 2.7.13. I was unable to reproduce the bug I also tried on my CentOS developer instance, both with Python2 and Python3 and unable to produce this bug.

		Hmm. It reproduces every time for me. You have slightly different OS and Python versions, I know it is VERY unlikely this is the cause but....
I will try it with 2.7.13 and see if it reproduces. Thx.

		I think I found the cause. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/masscognition&gt;@masscognition&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  it seems to me that you caught a weird bug 
also is in adverbs list, but somehow  in lookup.py its lemma is conjurer ? :)
I made a quick fix.

		Thanks a lot for the report and fix! üëç
Looks like the lemmatization table we're using contained this typo, and it was ported over. Very strange. Since v2.0.3, we've also improved the way lemmas are set in English (rules based on POS tags first if a tagger is available, then lookup table). This also explains why the weird behaviour wasn't reproducable in the latest version (where spaCy correctly uses the POS tag to determine the lemma).

		I viewed the file history, I don't have a clue how that line came :)
Yesterday I made a  awk + grep to check other lemmas. Rest of the file looks normal, only this line contains a typo somehow.
