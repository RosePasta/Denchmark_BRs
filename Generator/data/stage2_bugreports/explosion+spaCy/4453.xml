	<summary>Matcher remove not working on master</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Having cloned master and building from source, it seems that the matcher remove functionality is not working properly. It does remove the pattern from _patterns but it is still matching on the pattern. I confirmed that this bug does not exist in the released version (2.2.1). I would also suggest that the test found here: 


spaCy/spacy/tests/matcher/test_matcher_logic.py


         Line 148
      in
      2d249a9






 def test_matcher_remove(en_vocab): 




 be modified to make sure that no matches are found once the pattern has been removed.
Repro steps (on master)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import spacy
&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
&gt;&gt;&gt; from spacy.matcher import Matcher
&gt;&gt;&gt; text = "This is some text."
&gt;&gt;&gt; doc = nlp(text)
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher(doc)
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher.add("pattern", None, [{"ORTH": "some"}])
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher(doc)
[(15329811787164753587, 2, 3)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher.remove("pattern")
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher(doc)
[(15329811787164753587, 2, 3)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; matcher._patterns
{}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
