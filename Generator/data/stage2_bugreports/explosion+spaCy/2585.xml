	<summary>vocab.set_vector throws for oov word in windows 10</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run below code in windows 10:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import spacy
import numpy as np

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')
vocab = nlp.vocab
vector = np.zeros(300,)
vocab.set_vector('thisisoovword', vector) #throws
print('completed')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Got error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):  File "d:\git\test\testSet_vector.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;    vocab.set_vector('thisisoovword', vector)
  File "vocab.pyx", line 335, in spacy.vocab.Vocab.set_vector
  File "vectors.pyx", line 153, in spacy.vectors.Vectors.resize
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The same code works well in ubuntu
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Could you upgrade to v2.0.12 and check again? I think the error has been fixed, which is why you're seeing it different on Ubuntu -- I think you're using a different version there.
