	<summary>Token Method bug ?</summary>
	<description>
Using str(token) should return the equivalent of token.orth_.encode('utf8') . However when I use it I get back the equivalent of token.text_with_ws . My work around is unicode(token.orth_) .
Thanks for a great package !

		Thanks, fixed.
This sort of fix is nasty because it involves a change in semantics that might silently break existing code. To help people ease the transition, I've added a toggle spacy.tokens.token.keep_Token__str__semantics. Passing True to this function sets a global switch that preserves the old semantics.
This function will disappear in a future version --- it's just there to help people migrate their code.
