	<summary>Vocab.load_vectors() returns 0?</summary>
	<description>
Downloaded a word2vec model from here: &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.fredericgodin.com/software/&gt;http://www.fredericgodin.com/software/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I followed the tutorial here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/docs/tutorials/load-new-word-vectors&gt;https://spacy.io/docs/tutorials/load-new-word-vectors&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Now it seems to work, as in, when I do doc1.similarity(doc2) I get different results from before, but I'm a bit confused why it returns 0 instead of some number?
