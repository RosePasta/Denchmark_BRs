	<summary>Vocab.load throws error due to "/" operator usage with strings.</summary>
	<description>
When I attempt to run Vocab.load(path) I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'unicode'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Looking at error and code it appears that '/' operator is being applied to strings, which my Python does not agree with. Is this an issue with my Python version or something similar? I've tested the use of '/' with strings in Python 3 as well and get the same error.
Thanks!!

		It seems like this  /  idiom is used throughout your code, so obviously I am missing something... Apologies.

		Am running into a similar issue trying to load a saved EntityRecogniser.

		Ok found it, so it's using pathlib .
try:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import pathlib
mypath = pathlib.Path('path/as/string')
mypath / 'file.json'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

should work!

		For future reference: All .load() methods are supposed to take either strings or Path objects. If you pass in a string, it's supposed to be immediately converted to a Path. So, this is a bug.

		FYI, this is not fixed for loading a saved EntityRecognizer (also ran into same issue)
