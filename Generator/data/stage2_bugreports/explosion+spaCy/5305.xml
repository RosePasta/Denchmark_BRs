  How can I overcome this?  Do you have a nightly release I can install with the mentioned fix? I tried  but it says version 2.1.

		We don't have a current spacy-nightly available right now, I'm afraid. But you have two other options:

Build the current master branch from source (I don't think this is necessary - it may be a bit of overhead if you haven't done this before)
Apply the changes linked by Adriane to your local spacy/cli/train.py file. This should hopefully be quite straightforward: just make sure to add these 5 lines to the correct places.
