	<summary>Support for numpy.unicode_ type</summary>
	<description>
According to the numpy dtype docs, numpy.unicode_ is equivalent to pythons built in unicode type (&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.dtypes.html&gt;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.dtypes.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) , however when trying to do something like the following
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;c = np.atleast_1d(u'this test')
[d for d in parser.pipe(c)]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Results in:
TypeError: Argument 'string' has incorrect type (expected unicode, got numpy.unicode_)

		Hmm, I'd hoped to make this work with a Cython fused type, but it seems numpy doesn't offer a type definition for its unicode_ type. I could add a type conversion on the API boundary, for pipe, __call__, etc. I'm not sure this is a great solution.
Can you just call unicode on the text before passing it to spaCy?

		The text is already unicode. It looks like the real issue is np.array can not be used as a drop in replacement container for built in list ie
parser.pipe(np.array(["test this"])) 
Solution was to just call .tolist on the ndarray
