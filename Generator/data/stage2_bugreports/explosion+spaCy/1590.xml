		I noticed the same problem for the German model. Seems as if this is a general issue with the small models.

		I'm building an application which is relying on the prob-attribute right now and I would like to be able to use it in several languages (for most of which only small models are available at the moment).
It would be helpful to know whether this problem (prob always being -20) is a bug that can be fixed or whether it's maybe a functionality that simply does not work with the small models (similar to word vectors only being available in larger models).
Is there maybe some alternative way in spacy to find out the "general" frequency or probability of a word?

 We've been working through the backlog on spaCy that built up while I was on holidays over December. I think we'll probably get this resolved in the next week or so.
Merging this thread with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1574&gt;#1574&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , as the root cause of both is the same.
