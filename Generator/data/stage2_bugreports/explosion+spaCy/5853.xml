&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hello! First of all, this awesome package! I am trying to do 2 things:

Divide a string into sentences
Get the noun_chunks of each sentence

I am aiming to do this in a variety of languages, but primarily experimenting with English, Spanish and Portuguese.
Issue 1: With the Spanish model, I get the following behavior:


Sentence 1:  En resúmen AR es un servicio que auxilia los tecnicos de campo a obtener ayuda en la atención de casos     complejos o que necesite de un soporte de un especialista.
Noun chunks:  [AR, un servicio, los tecnicos, campo, ayuda, la atención, casos, complejos, un soporte, un especialista]


Sentence 2:  Se puede con eso utilizar del smartphone para compartir de manera segura la imagen del device permitindo que se haga notaciones en la pantalla facilitando el reparo.
Noun chunks:  [AR, un servicio, los tecnicos, campo, ayuda, la atención, casos, complejos, un soporte]


As you can see, the noun chunks for sentence 2 seem to be referring to the first sentence, as if when I call sentence.noun_chunks I would still be referring to the past sentence.

Issue 2: With the Portuguese model, I get the following sentence (same code as above only with the portuguese model pt_core_news_sm loaded:


Sentence 1: Qual é o link para o estudo de Forrester sobre MVS em Portugues?
noun chunks: [[]]


Sentence 2: Aproveite a leitura e compartilhe com seus clientes.
noun chunks: [[]]


Am I doing something wrong or is this expected behavior? Maybe because it's a different language? In English things seem to be working relatively well. Thank you very much!

		Thanks for the report, this does look like a bug for Spanish. We'll look into it!
Not all languages have an implemented noun_chunks method and there isn't one yet for Portuguese. Since it relies on UD POS tags and dependencies, it's possible that once the Spanish noun_chunks is fixed, you can adapt it easily to also work for Portuguese, since I would guess that Portuguese noun chunks are quite similar to Spanish noun chunks.
