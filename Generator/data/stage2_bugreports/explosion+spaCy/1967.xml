	<summary>Entity types with dashes cause errors in ner.pyx</summary>
	<description>
When training NER task on entities that are in BILOU that also have a dash the line &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/ab35ac4e6fc8c8e0d606e8eae95afbc182f8d90a/spacy/syntax/ner.pyx#L87&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 throws this error. Simple workaround was to replace the dash character in my entities in a preprocessing step.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Info about spaCy&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		You mean entity labels with dash, right? Like if the label is JOB-NAME? Agree that we shouldn't have that restriction.
