	<summary>Unexpected behavior when load pre-trained word2vec</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I got [E094] Error reading line 50 in vectors file ... when I tried to load my own pre-train Gensim word2vec in .txt fotmat.
I track down the exception and find it is raised here:
https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/cli/init_model.py#L184
Should it be line.rsplit(' ', vectors_data.shape[1]) ? For example, if we have a n-dimension wordvec, there should be n+1 columns for each row. To split the row into n+1 elements(1 word + n-d vec), we only need to split it n+1-1=n times.
line.rsplit(' ', vectors_data.shape[1] + 1) may cause problem when a word token contains whitespaces.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 I think you're right, sorry for the off-by-one error. Could you make a pull request with the fix?
