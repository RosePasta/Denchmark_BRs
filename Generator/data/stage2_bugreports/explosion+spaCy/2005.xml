	<summary>Strange Matcher behavior with * quantifier and two rules</summary>
	<description>
I'm not sure why these two rules are resulting in a match on the given text. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;nlp = spacy.load('en')
doc = nlp("I took out the trash.")
matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)
matcher.add("rule1", None, [
	{'TAG': 'VBD'},
	{'LOWER': 'the'},
	{'POS': 'NOUN'}
])
matcher.add("rule2", None, [
	{'TAG': 'VBD'},
	{'IS_ALPHA': True, 'OP': '*'},
	{'LOWER': 'any'},
	{'LOWER': 'words'}
])
matches = matcher(doc)
for (match_id, start, end) in matches:
	span = doc[start:end]
	
	label = doc.vocab.strings[match_id]
	
	print(label)
	print(str(span))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The result is a match on rule 1:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;rule1
took out the trash
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But rule 1 shouldn't allow the word "out." Removing either rule results in no matches.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
