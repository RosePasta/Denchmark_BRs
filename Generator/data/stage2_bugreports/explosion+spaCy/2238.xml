	<summary>Minor: Swedish lemmatizer confuses "year" with "oar"</summary>
	<description>
I would've submitted a pull request but perhaps I'm missing something here.
from spacy.lang.sv import Swedish

nlp = Swedish()

[x.lemma_ for x in nlp('F√∂r tv√• √•r sedan')]
outputs
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;['F√∂r', 'tv√•', '√•ra', 'sedan']
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Here, the word  (year) is lemmatized to  (oar), which is obviously not correct. The mapping from  to  can be found in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/lang/sv/lemmatizer/lookup.py&gt;spacy/lang/sv/lemmatizer/lookup.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Thanks for the report! (Unfortunately, this often happens with freely available tables and resources that get passed around a lot. They're never 100% perfect ‚Äì but I'm glad we have a community that spots and reports mistakes like this üôè)
What would be the correct solution then? Should √•r be removed entirely, or should the mapping be replaced with something else? (If you have a second, you could also just submit a PR instead.)

		 should be removed entirely. I submitted &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/2241&gt;a PR here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
