	<summary>Token's  property `is_currency` does not work</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have a piece of simple code from public tests
doc = nlp("Net income was $9 million")
assert [t.text for t in doc] == ['Net', 'income', 'was', '$', '9', 'million'] # test passes
assert doc[3].is_currency == True
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-70-0b36974f0595&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 assert doc[3].is_currency == True
doc[3].is_currency  # False
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Thanks for the report â€“ I think I know what the problem is: Since the is_currency attribute was added after the current models were trained, it's not yet present in the models (wihch cache the lexical attributes in their lexemes.bin).
In contrast, the following works as expected:
from spacy.lang.en import English

nlp = English()
doc = nlp("Net income was $9 million")
assert doc[3].is_currency == True
This will be fixed with the next model release!

 thanks for your comment!
Looking forward to the next model release.
Indeed, it works for your example.
