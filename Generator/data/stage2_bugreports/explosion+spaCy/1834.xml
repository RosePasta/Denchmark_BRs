	<summary>Sentences boundaries not serialized / deserialized with custom SBD component</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm using a SBD component to access sentences without parsing the document.
I just noticed that after serialization, and deserialization I lose the information about sentence boundaries. To reproduce:
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en", disable=["parser"])
nlp.add_pipe(spacy.pipeline.SentenceSegmenter(nlp))
doc = nlp("First sentence. And a second sentence")

assert len(list(doc.sents)) &gt; 1   # Success

new_doc = spacy.tokens.Doc(nlp.vocab).from_bytes(doc.to_bytes())
assert len(list(new_doc.sents)) &gt; 1   # Fail
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Info about spaCy&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


spaCy version: 2.0.5
Platform: Darwin-16.7.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version: 3.6.2
Models: en

		Thanks for the report and example code. I believe this is the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1799&gt;#1799&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , so I'll close this one (can't wait for 'merge issues' in Github...)

		I found a solution, also fixing related other bugs such as wrong is_parsed, is_tagged flag after deserialization. I'll submit soon
