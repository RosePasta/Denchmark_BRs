	<summary>calling sents() on empty string</summary>
	<description>
I guess it was unexpected to get this error:
[s for s in nlp(u'').sents] -&gt; IndexError: list index out of range
I.e. calling sents on an empty string errors out - I wonder if this is the right behavior, or if sents should return an empty array?

		Thanks.
This should either return an empty list or yield out of an empty generator (off the top of my head, I don't remember whether .sents is a generator...Which is probably a bad sign. =/)
