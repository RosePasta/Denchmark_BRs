	<summary>Second noun chunk contains first one.</summary>
	<description>
For one sentence, the chunker returns a strange noun chunk:



import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en')
doc = nlp(unicode('Does flight number three fifty-four require a connecting flight to get to Boston?'))
for np in doc.noun_chunks:
...     print np
...
flight number
Does flight number three fifty-four require
a connecting flight
Boston
exit()



"Does flight number three fifty-four require" shouldn't be there.
My Environment:

Python version: 2.7.6
Platform: Linux-3.4.0+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-14.04-trusty
spaCy version: 1.7.5
Installed models: en

Out of the 3000 sentences I've parsed, about 130 experience this problem.

		Thanks, this is a regression introduced in a recent patch. Will be fixed in next release.
