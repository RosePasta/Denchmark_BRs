		Thanks for the report!  comparisons were modified in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/5005&gt;#5005&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so now spans from different documents are never equal. I think this test could be updated to check the  values instead.

		Or simply compare sent.text instead of sent?
