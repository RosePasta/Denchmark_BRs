	<summary>Loaded NER Model gives different results</summary>
	<description>
I followed the spaCy documentation to train my custom NER Model but I cant seem to get the same results from the saved model.
This is the result when I use the trained object to predict which gives me the correct set of results.

Saved the model obtained on training and got completely different and wrong results for same textual data input. Output shown in below image:

Any help appreciated.

		Thanks for the report. I think this probably has the same root cause as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/3433&gt;#3433&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . It's currently our highest priority bug.

		Confirmed this is the same as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/3433&gt;#3433&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think I've got a fix now. Closing this to merge with the prior thread.

Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ak3895&gt;@ak3895&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, are you trying to train your model to parse the resumes?
If so, can you please help me with this &lt;denchmark-link:3528#issuecomment-483947072&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/3528#issuecomment-483947072&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 also did you add additional entity types to an existing pretrained ner model(eg: en_core_web_sm) like the one mentioned &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/usage/training#example-new-entity-type&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
