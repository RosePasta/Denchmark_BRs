	<summary>Replacing vec.bin with wordtovec model</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to replace vec.bin as per the blog: &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/docs/tutorials/load-new-word-vectors&gt;https://spacy.io/docs/tutorials/load-new-word-vectors&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Code am using is as per the above cited link:
from spacy.en import English
nlp = English()
n_dimensions = nlp.vocab.load_vectors('~/Downloads/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz')
print n_dimensions
The file to be loaded is Google News pre-trained model on this link: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api&gt;https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But it displays 0 as dimension. Am not able to resolve this. Please help!

		I'm getting a similar error.
However, I start with a text file, one line per vector of the format:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;word_1 float_1 float_2 ...
word_2 float_dim+1 float_dim+2 ...
...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The text file is then bzip'd and fed into spacy.vocab.write_binary_vectors("vec.bz2", "vectors.bin").
I then try to load vectors.bin as above and am informed that n_dimensions is 0.
