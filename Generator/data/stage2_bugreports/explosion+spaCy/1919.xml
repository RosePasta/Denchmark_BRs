	<summary>Model training on 2.0.6 impossible</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It's not possible to train a model with the newest (2.0.6) version of spacy.
A token_vector_width KeyError is raised when calling begin_training on the language instance.
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Install Spacy 2.0.6
Try the following:

import spacy
model = spacy.load('en')
opt = model.begin_training()
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using Spacy2.0.6 on two different environments:

Docker with base image python:3.6-slim
Windows 7 x64 with a python3.6 x64 virtualenv

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Notes&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The problem does not happen on 2.0.5

		Thanks --- didn't have a test covering this...Training works if from scratch, but not if the model is pre-loaded as in your example. Fixing.
