	<summary>OSError on load_vectors_from_bin_loc()</summary>
	<description>
I have a word2vec model (binary) that I want to load into the vocab before training with train_ud.py. Unfortunately, I'm met by an OSError when running load_vectors_from_bin_loc().
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "spacy/bin/parser/train_ud.py", line 112, in &lt;module&gt;
    plac.call(main)

OSError
The error message is not exactly descriptive, so I'm wondering what might be the issue here?

		Agree that the error messaging could be improved. It's difficult because we're reporting from a C error. I need to look into checking the error message properly.
Have you checked the obvious, like whether the file exists, whether you have enough memory...?

		Yeah, the file exists - for non-existing files the error is more precise; OSError: Could not open binary file b'&lt;filename&gt;'.
I have 8 GB memory and more than 2 GB available, which should suffice?

		Closing this and making &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1046&gt;#1046&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the master issue. Work in progress for spaCy v2.0!
