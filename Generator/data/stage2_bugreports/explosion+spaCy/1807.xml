	<summary>nlp.vocab.set_vector fails to add new vocab in vectors_fast_text.py</summary>
	<description>
When I run the vectors_fast_text.py example code, I encounter a problem where the new vocab words are not being added to the vocabulary. I can see that the words and vectors look fine as I read them in, e.g.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;...
leicht
[ 0.36014  0.18184 -0.11139 -0.12497 -0.13684 ...]
besitz
[-0.04354     0.15431    -0.13097    -0.23924001 -0.14453  ... ]
...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but after each iteration, the vocab size remains at 173, all of which seem to be pre-defined terms, maybe for the tokenizer? First few: 'Ã¼.', 'XD', ';-D', '&gt;:o', ':-)', '&lt;3', ' ', '8)', '\\n', 'c.', ':&gt;'
I first ran into this problem using other code and could reproduce with the example. Is this a  problem with nlp.vocab.set_vector?

 -- wish I'd read this a little sooner! I got back from Australia last week, and promptly got sick. Air travel...
