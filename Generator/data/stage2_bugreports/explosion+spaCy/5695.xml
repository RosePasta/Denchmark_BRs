	<summary>Spacy 2.3 'with nlp.disable_pipes()' does not properly restore the pipes.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I run the example &lt;denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/usage/training/#example-train-ner&gt;https://spacy.io/usage/training/#example-train-ner&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with a pretrained model  the  does not get properly closed and the saved model only has the  component, not the tagger and parser. However if I do the normal disable flow without the context manager  it works fine.
Seems like a bug to me but wondering if others can reproduce.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


spaCy version: 2.3.0
Platform: Darwin-18.6.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version: 3.7.7

		Thanks for the report! I screwed up the  syntax when I added the warnings filter. It should be fixed now in  by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/5690&gt;#5690&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so if you look at the current version it should be correct: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/examples/training/train_ner.py&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/examples/training/train_ner.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
