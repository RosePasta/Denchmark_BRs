	<summary>No meaningful message when a language is not supported by doc.noun_chunks</summary>
	<description>
When the vocabulary language is not set to "en" or "de" the doc.noun_chunks method fails with the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "XX.py", line 55, in YY
for np in doc.noun_chunks:
File "spacy/tokens/doc.pyx", line 404, in __get__ (spacy/tokens/doc.cpp:9194) TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It is because there is no CHUNKERS defined for the language in spcay.syntax.iterators. A meaningful error message should maybe be added and a nice way to plug-in others LANG_noun_chunks functions.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Agreed, thanks. Support for other languages is still patchy and unofficial, so you'll probably meet a lot of similar rough spots.

		This should now be fixed both on master and in v2. Also improved the error messages – they now link to the documentation instead of telling the user to download a specific model (which was non-existent for languages other than ,  and  – see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1051&gt;#1051&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
