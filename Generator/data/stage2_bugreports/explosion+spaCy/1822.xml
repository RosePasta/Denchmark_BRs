	<summary>is_oov returns True for common values of DEP, TAG, etc.</summary>
	<description>
The semantics of is_oov are not entirely clear to me. Is it supposed to return True only for out-of-vocabulary words? What about other vocabulary elements?
Example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import spacy
&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
&gt;&gt;&gt; doc = nlp("John loves Mary")
&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp.vocab[doc[0].dep].text
'nsubj'
&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp.vocab[doc[0].dep].is_oov
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp.vocab[doc[1].dep].text
'ROOT'
&gt;&gt;&gt; nlp.vocab[doc[1].dep].is_oov
False
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I suppose 'ROOT' is not out-of-vocabulary because it's also a word, while 'nsubj' isn't.
My use-case is that I use spaCy for feature extraction for my classifier, and then I save the extracted feature matrix (of numeric IDs) to a file so I can use it later in training without even having to import spacy. I'd like to treat out-of-vocabulary symbols as "unknown", so my classifier won't even have to allocate elements for them in the embeddings lookup table. However, it seems like I can't use this strategy since I certainly don't want to treat 'nsubj' as "unknown". Should I just apply this rule only for ORTH and LEMMA features?
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Info about spaCy&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Python version: 3.5.2+
spaCy version: 2.0.5
Platform: Linux-4.8.4-aufs-1-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid
Models: en_core_web_lg

		Thanks for the report.
Merging with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1574&gt;#1574&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as the underlying issue is the sme.
