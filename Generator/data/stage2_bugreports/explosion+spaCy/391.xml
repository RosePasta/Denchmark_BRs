	<summary>Assert on legal input</summary>
	<description>
Hello!
Just want to report something unexpected to me. I will be very grateful if anyone would let me know what's this assert for because this input looks fine to me.
Code
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;text = u"Lol Pitt Civil Engineering students do senior design projects on this problem"
nlp = spacy.en.English()
nlp.matcher = None
doc = nlp(text)
print (doc.ents)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 118, in &lt;module&gt;
    print (docents)

  File "spacy/tokens/doc.pyx", line 199, in spacy.tokens.doc.Doc.ents.__get__ (spacy/tokens/doc.cpp:7191)
AssertionError
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am at version 0.101.0.

		Here are several more examples where doc.ents results in an AssertionError.

		I regret that I'm only dealing with this now...
I can't reproduce this issue, on either 0.101.0 or 1.0. Thoughts?
