	<summary>Error when tab-completing methods for token</summary>
	<description>
I ran into an issue where I try to tab-complete the methods from a token, and I get an endless and unstoppable series of Deprecation warnings. This code reproduces the bug on my machine:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en")       # same behavior with `en_core_web_lg`
doc = nlp("Tokens are an important component of written language.")
tok = doc[3]
tok.[TAB]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This results in an endless stream of repeated warnings that can't be stopped with ctrl-C:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/Users/ahalterman/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/threading.py:884: DeprecationWarning: Token.sent_start is now deprecated. Use Token.is_sent_start instead, which returns a boolean value or None if the answer is unknown â€“ instead of a misleading 0 for False and 1 for True. It also fixes a quirk in the old logic that would always set the property to 0 for the first word of the document.
  self._bootstrap_inner()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		In a different context, I got another error when tab-completing the methods from a token:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/ahalterman/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jedi/cache.py", line 119, in wrapper
    return dct[key]
KeyError: (('sent_start',), frozenset())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
