	<summary>sentences don't work</summary>
	<description>
Possibly I am misunderstanding something, but it looks like the "sentences" spacy finds are just individual words.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [1]: import spacy

In [2]: nlp = spacy.load('en')

In [3]: doc = nlp('Hello, world. Here is a second sentence.')

In [4]: sentence = next(doc.sents)

In [5]: sentence.text
Out[5]: 'Hello'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I understand the documentation, this should be 'Hello, world.'

		Hi,
Did you download and install the data?

		If downloading the data means doing sudo python -m spacy.en.download all, yes, I did.

		Hmm. Have a look within the package directory, and check that the data is actually there. sudo can be tricksy with Python, because it fiddles with your environment variables.
