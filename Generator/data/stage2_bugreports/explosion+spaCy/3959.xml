	<summary>Modified pos attribute not being serialized</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since  attribute of tokens is now writable (related &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/2014#issuecomment-376642763&gt;comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ), I ran into the issue that I changed the pos tag and serialized the doc but on deserializing, it retained the original pos tag.
I believe this is happening because only the  attributes are pickled
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en')
d = nlp("displaCy uses JavaScript, SVG and CSS to show you how computers understand language")
print(d[0].pos_) # prints ADJ
d[0].pos_ = "NOUN"
d.to_disk("t.txt")

d2 = nlp("")
d2.from_disk("t.txt")
print(d2[0].pos_) # prints ADJ
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Wasn't entirely sure if this should be a bug or a feature request to make pos tags picklable or maybe documentation could be added specifying how serializing would not save changes in coarse grained attributes with pos tag as examples
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
