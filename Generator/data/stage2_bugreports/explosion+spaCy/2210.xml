	<summary>doc.noun_chunks not working as expected for spanish models</summary>
	<description>
This issue is occurring with both spanish models, the following error happens when trying to iterate over the the noun_chunks of a doc:
Traceback (most recent call last): File "playground.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt; for nc in doc.noun_chunks: File "doc.pyx", line 503, in __get__ File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/spacy/lang/es/syntax_iterators.py", line 19, in noun_chunks left, right = noun_bounds(token) File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/spacy/lang/es/syntax_iterators.py", line 39, in noun_bounds if token.dep in np_left_deps: NameError: global name 'np_left_deps' is not defined
The same code works by using an english model and sentence instead of a spanish one.

		I have the same issue. What should I do to solve it?
I've manually replaced syntax_iterators.py with the corrected file by Ines, and it works now.
But how to do the replacement correctly, via pip or whatever?
Thanks
