	<summary>Possible copy-paste bug in NN parser</summary>
	<description>



spaCy/spacy/syntax/nn_parser.pyx


        Lines 59 to 60
      in
      a3c43a1






 conv_depth = util.env_opt('conv_depth', cfg.get('conv_depth', 4)) 



 conv_window = util.env_opt('conv_window', cfg.get('conv_depth', 1)) 





Is it possible there is a copy/paste mistake when reading the conv_window parameter, and it just reads the same value as conv_depth?

		That is indeed a mistake! Thanks. Now I'm confused as to why this hasn't caused more problems? I guess it might be relatively recent.

		Thanks for the report! I had recently found and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/commit/cd0a9e58dcf5ec4316e6b1aaa954c55a9ea18cf4&gt;fixed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this on a side branch of spaCy that will be integrated in the near future, but I'll quickly add the fix also to  for use in the meantime.
