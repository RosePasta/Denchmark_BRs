	<summary>Model Visualization: wrong output shape for flatten layer</summary>
	<description>
To reproduce the issue: call coremltools.utils.visualize_spec(...)on a model with a flatten layer, and click the button to turn on shapes. The output for a flatten layers always seem to be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. However it should be [1, 1, C * H * W, 1, 1] where C, H, and W are based on the input to the flatten layer.
