	<summary>Inference Problem in the converted model</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêûDescribe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The model is a Keras CNN LSTM with spectrogram inputs and softmax output, the conversion went well, i checked the graph model with visualize_spec and everything seems good too, but when I make a prediction, there is a huge gap in results. I did another try cutting a subgraph before the LSTM layer, and there is still differents results, how is this possible?
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Follow this link (&lt;denchmark-link:https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/7390376&gt;https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/feedback/7390376&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) to apple debugging report, you'll find :

a notebook to reproduce the procedure
the keras model and the input sample for debug test

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;System environment (please complete the following information):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


coremltools version  : 3.0
OS (e.g., MacOS, Linux): Macos
macOS version (if applicable): 10.15 Catalina
XCode version (if applicable): 11
How you install python (anaconda, virtualenv, system): virtualenv
python version (e.g. 3.7): 3.6
any other relevant information:

Keras version 2.2.4



Tell me if I missed something with the link, i m not sure i made it in the app you suggested.
Thanks

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kezakool&gt;@kezakool&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for reporting the issue! The numeric difference is ~0.01 which might be caused by implementation details of activation layers, especially on GPU. Can you try set flag  in your  call to verify?
