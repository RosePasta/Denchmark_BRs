	<summary>Error reading protobuf spec. validator error: The .mlmodel supplied is of version 3, intended for a newer version of Xcode. This version of Xcode supports model version 2 or earlier.</summary>

Ported from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/701&gt;apple/turicreate#701&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

On Linux, loading a spec into an MLModel with any specification version works, because it doesn't attempt to validate/compile the model, since it assumes Core ML doesn't exist on the system anyway.
On latest macOS with latest Xcode, loading a spec into an MLModel with any supported specification version works, because model validation/compilation succeeds.
However, loading a spec into an MLModel with specification version 3 on macOS 10.13 with Xcode 9.4 fails with the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error reading protobuf spec. validator error: The .mlmodel supplied is of version 3, intended for a newer version of Xcode. This version of Xcode supports model version 2 or earlier.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected:
This should work on older macOS/Xcode the same way it works on Linux, perhaps with a runtime warning that predict won't be available.
Actual:
Since this throws a Python exception, it interrupts execution of the caller and in the case of Turi Create, results in an unusable exported model/spec.
