	<summary>Setting epochs to any value other than what is in the model definition prevents training</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêûDescribe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have a trainable model converted from Keras. Starting training works fine but when I try to adjust the epochs value, the training fails to start. It seems I can only use the epochs value in the model default parameters. If I manually change the epochs value when converting the model, I can use the new value from my app but no other values are working.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A bootstrapped example can be found here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PuBzRLS5WjsxJii4KACW9AL4HFXjeiNM/view?usp=sharing&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PuBzRLS5WjsxJii4KACW9AL4HFXjeiNM/view?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For me, it is sufficient to change the epochs value from the default value 1 to another value here:
configuration.parameters = [MLParameterKey.epochs : 1]
in ViewController.swift and the training will not start.

 I tried downloading that but, google denied access. Could you mark it as public until I download?
One question - what is the error message you see in the catch block?
Thanks for reporting the issue :)

		Sorry about that, here is the new link:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EKZuJMYrkXzR9ey2h7xO2mAj6hSzLJWY/view?usp=sharing&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EKZuJMYrkXzR9ey2h7xO2mAj6hSzLJWY/view?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The error is this one:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Failed to start update task Error Domain=com.apple.CoreML Code=0 "2 is not a valid value given constraint 
minValue: 1
maxValue: 10
enumeratedNumbers: {(
    1,
    10
)} for key epochs" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=2 is not a valid value given constraint 
minValue: 1
maxValue: 10
enumeratedNumbers: {(
    1,
    10
)} for key epochs}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So using 1 or 10 is ok but using anything in between like 2 does not work.
Maybe I am misunderstanding but I would expect to be able to input any value less than the epochs?

 the following call adds "1" as an allowed epoch value by default since keras model does not capture epochs in the h5 format.
coreml_model = coremltools.converters.keras.convert('empty_model.h5', respect_trainable=True)
Later, when you do builder.set_epochs(10), we extended the allowed epoch values to [1, 10]. The value you provide during runtime should be one of those. That said, you could change the allowed values by specifying allowed_set:
builder.set_epochs(10, allowed_set=[10, 20, 30, 40])
Let me know if that works for you.

As always, thanks for the super fast reply. You are correct, with your solution I can use other values as well as long as they are in the allowed set.
If I may, I would say that the description in xCode is a bit misleading.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7461655/68373027-46789b80-0142-11ea-9f27-f0ea3e55a197.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It says "Maximum number of iterations training takes" and in this case, it shows 10 but I have used:
builder.set_epochs(10, allowed_set=[2, 4, 6, 10, 20])
when converting the model and epochs=20 is working when running training.
The important thing is that I now know how to run other epoch values so feel free to close this and thanks again for the help.

 I agree the message is misleading. I have filed a bug to fix this. Thanks for your feedback.
