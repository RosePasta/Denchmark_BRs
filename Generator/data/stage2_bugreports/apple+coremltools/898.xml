	<summary>Internal prediction _debug outputs triggering conversion crash</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêûDescribe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I ran into this issue trying to using a KNearestNeighborsClassifierBuilder layer and running predict on the model. I did some debugging and it appears to be related to some internal _debugNearestDistances outputs being returned by the model. I'm not sure if these are temporary to the beta or what their long term intent is.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Here's a minimal example that reproduces the issue.
from coremltools.models import MLModel
from coremltools.models.nearest_neighbors import KNearestNeighborsClassifierBuilder
import numpy as np

builder = KNearestNeighborsClassifierBuilder(
    input_name="input",
    output_name="label",
    number_of_dimensions=1,
    default_class_label="???",
)

model = MLModel(builder.spec)
data = {"input": np.array([1.0])}

# Error: Unrecognized sequence type.
model.predict(data)
The error is thrown from Utils::convertSequenceValueToPython:



coremltools/coremlpython/CoreMLPythonUtils.mm


         Line 561
      in
      08dc420






 throw std::runtime_error("Error: Unrecognized sequence type."); 





I originally thought it was an issue with my input data, but it's actually crashing trying to convert the output to a Python object. Inside the return output is a field called _debugNearestDistances that is a MLSequence of MLFeatureTypeDouble. The MLFeatureTypeDouble type is also odd since that doesn't seem to be a legal type of sequence, but I'm not sure about that.
I guess I'm not sure if the issue is more to do with the framework level CoreML APIs or if it's something coremltools should handle or maybe just discard any _ fields.
Thanks!
