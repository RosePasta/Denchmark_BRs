	<summary>coremltools.convert can not create neuralNetworkClassifier</summary>
	<description>
I create a CoreML Model from Keras model (TensorFlow 2) with using coremltools.convert, and I open it with XCode I can not see Class labels, inputs type as image (it show as MultiArray) and preview tab to try with smaple image. Also, when I try to get neuralNetworkClassifier spec layers with using spec.neuralNetworkClassifier.layers, it returns empty list.
I tried to use get layers with using spec.neuralNetwork.layers, it returns layers correctly but causes to endless spec.neuralNetwork.layers.extend(layers) operation and it finish with killed kernel.
This situation causes me not to create a healthy CoreML model. Can anybody help me?
Versions:

XCode 12.2
TensorFlow 2.3.1
Keras 2.2.4 &amp; 2.4.3
Coremltools  4.0

Notes:
-My Keras model is working very well.
-My CoreML model that I created last year from the same Keras model was working without any problems. (I can not remember versions from last year.)

It worked a little. Now I can see  in XCode but I still can not see  and  to try with sample image.

		It worked when I use image_input = coremltools.ImageType() without any given argument.
