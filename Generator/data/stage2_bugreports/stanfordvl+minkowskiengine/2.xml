		Can you put more info when this happens?
It seems like open3d had some problems.
Can you run other examples other than the indoor.py without a problem?

I solved the problem by importing open3d before torch.
But I still want to know why it happened.

,  is already loaded before torch.
What exactly do you mean by importing open3d before torch? Did you mean importing open3d before numpy?

I replaced #L5-L9 just with "import open3d as o3d" and loaded it after torch.

		I cannot reproduce this issue on my ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.
However, it seems like it is similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/6194&gt;pytorch/pytorch#6194&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/926#issuecomment-284258385&gt;pytorch/pytorch#926 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Both issues are solved by simply switching the import order. I faced a similar issue long time ago and can’t recall exactly why, but I remember vaguely that in python, importing a large shared libraries should be done before importing smaller ones to prevent this type of problems. However, importing torch later solved this type of problems most of the time, which is what the current example/indoor.py is doing, similar to all the other issues that I referenced.
Can you put more info regarding your system?
Version of linux
Torch version,
Open3d version,
And nvcc version?
Can you reproduce this error simply by, python -c "import open3d as o3d; import torch"?

I cannot reproduce this issue on my ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.

However, it seems like it is similar to pytorch/pytorch#6194

		Found similar issue on the Open3D issue page &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/922&gt;intel-isl/Open3D#922&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

They imported open3d first like the examples/indoor.py. However, as this is an issue in open3d and pytorch, Ill leave this issue closed until they come up with a solution.
