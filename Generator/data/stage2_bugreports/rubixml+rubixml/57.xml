	<summary>Not able to train GridSearch with KDNeighbors as base</summary>
	<description>
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to a member function bare() on null in [..]/composer/vendor/rubix/ml/src/Classifiers/KDNeighbors.php on line 116 Error
Here it should return "!$this-&gt;tree-&gt;bare()", but the tree of KDNeighbors is not set by the GridSearch so the tree is still null.

		Thank you for the bug report @AllmightyPeanut
There is a period of time between instantiation of Grid Search and when train() is called where Grid Search uses a proxy base estimator (instantiated without a constructor using reflection) to infer things like data type compatibility. Unfortunately, this is causing this exception because the Spatial tree object is not injected as a dependency when we use reflection in this way.
Thanks again for the great bug report, I should have a fix shortly

		This issue has been fixed with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RubixML/ML/commit/c7cb857ea7ca9c8303471dd45f7539fc383428fa&gt;c7cb857&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

@AllmightyPeanut you can install the latest dev-master to use this fix until we release 0.0.20. Let me know if there are any issues, but tested well on my end
Thanks again for the great bug report
