	<summary>Classification/Extra Trees sometimes fail to output all probabilities</summary>
	<description>
The Classification Tree implementation intermittently fails to produce a probability for every class label. This is due falsely assuming the underlying CART will return all class labels. This is the intention of the CART implementation to allow flexibility in the future. However, the extending estimator must provide a full class list with probabilities to fulfill the Probabilistic API and therefore must have a default probability of 0 for each class regardless if a probability was returned by CART or not.
$template = array_fill_keys($this-&gt;classes, 0.);
$probs = array_replace($template, $node-&gt;probabilities())
should do the trick
