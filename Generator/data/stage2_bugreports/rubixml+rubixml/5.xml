	<summary>k-D LOF bug in LOF score calculation</summary>
	<description>
When neighbors() returns the computed distances in standard LOF, the method returns an array indexed by the original key from the training set, however, in k-D LOF neighbors returns a sequential array. Due to this, the k-D version LOF score calculation is always returning the first k local reachability densities instread of the k nearest neighbors LRDs.
Here is the code at fault ...
list($distances) = $this-&gt;neighbors($sample, $this-&gt;k);
...
$lrds = array_intersect_key($this-&gt;lrds, $distances);
