		Not sure if this is a problem with nni on Mac. Can you install any version of nni?
If that works, can you try to install from source?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    git clone -b v0.5.2.1.1 https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git
    cd nni	
    source install.sh	
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If any of this work, I would consider talking with nni folks directly

		It looks like Windows support has been added in later releases. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/scarlett2018&gt;@scarlett2018&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should we move to a more recent version? Are there breaking changes from the version we have now we should be aware of?

It looks like Windows support has been added in later releases. @scarlett2018 should we move to a more recent version? Are there breaking changes from the version we have now we should be aware of?

Keep in mind that a couple of minor changes are required for one of the tuners if we move to a newer version.

 - we had a new Mac build ready for this issue. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chicm-ms&gt;@chicm-ms&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 might add more details.

 - For the other question about breaking changes, since the v0.5.2.1.1 is a fairly old version, there are some changes might impact you (multiphase feature, annotation features). So, does it make sense that you try the latest version in a branch, and we can standby to help?

Do you think if we have a 30min meeting with you guys we could finish the upgrade to the new version and the needed changes in recommenders?
