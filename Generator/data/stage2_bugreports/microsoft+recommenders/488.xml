	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is affected by this bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

generate conda file is returning an error
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Azure Data Science Virtual Machine.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sh scripts/generate_conda_file.sh
scripts/generate_conda_file.sh: 64: scripts/generate_conda_file.sh: Syntax error: "(" unexpected (expecting "then")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		it would be really great to refactor this to a python script that leverages the &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/api/python_api.html&gt;conda api&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

we could have a base set of dependencies in a list, and separate dependencies for each environment in different lists, then just run a single command to create the desired environment on any OS.

		Good catch. This is because many times, sh isn't bash on ubuntu systems - it's dash. running as:
bash scripts/generate_conda_file.sh
or just running the script directly invokes bash instead.
./scripts/generate_conda_file.sh
Do you want me to change it to run on sh? I can adjust it if we want to run it using sh instead of bash.

		and that's another reason to support &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gramhagen&gt;@gramhagen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's suggestion

		I would suggest to have a quick fix now, so it can run on sh, to make sure that all the test pipelines work and that people following the documentation don't get problems.
Afterwards we can implement Scott's suggestion.. I think this makes a lot of sense
