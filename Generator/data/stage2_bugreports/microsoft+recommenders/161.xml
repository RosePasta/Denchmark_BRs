  mentioned in regards to the SAR deep dive notebook:
"The co-occurence matric $C$ has the following properties:
It is symmetric, so $c_{i,j} = c_{j,i}$
It is nonnegative: $c_{i,j} &gt;= 0$
The occurrences are at least as large as the co-occurrences. I.e, the largest element for each row (and column) is on the main diagonal: $∀(i,j) C_{i,i},C_{j,j}&gt;=C_{i,j}$."
The "&amp;gt" does not render as a single symbol but as "&gt;=".
