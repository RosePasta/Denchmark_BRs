	<summary>Python package incompatibility</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is affected by this bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Installation of conda environment can be successful but there is standard error generated from Azure DevOps that fails the build.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Where on the platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The CI/CD machine on the Azure DevOps platform.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Install the conda env with the current script will generate standard error streamline
requests 2.20.1 has requirement idna&lt;2.8,&gt;=2.5, but you'll have idna 2.8 which is incompatible.
This will fail the build.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Use a fixed version of idna to resolve the incompatibility issue.
There is no standard error that fails the build.
