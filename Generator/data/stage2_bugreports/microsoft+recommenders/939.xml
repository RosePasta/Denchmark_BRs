	<summary>[BUG] Smoke test failure because of run_cell module in papermill</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running of smoke test failed because  in  has been added with a new argument that breaks . Discussion from other developers of this issue can be also found &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nteract/papermill/issues/410&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The problem can be fixed if upgrading papermill to version &gt;1.0. However, this will lead to another issue where the method record is not available in papermill (it is deprecated).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

All platforms where papermill 0.18 is used.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run the smoke testing by
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python -m pytest tests/smoke/test_notebooks_python.py -k test_sar_single_node_smoke
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The following error will be generated
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1726448/65485377-50b54200-ded4-11e9-91ba-5832b3a8d00b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


The easiest way to resolve the issue is to fix the versions of nbconvert and papermill to the old one (nbconvert 5.5.0 and papermill 0.18.2) with which we passed the tests
Alternative may be using scrapbook for recording and reading the data in executing the notebooks.

 do we want to use  instead in the long-term run - it is used in NLP repo. Currently, using the fixed-versions mitigate the problem so that the testing can be passed
