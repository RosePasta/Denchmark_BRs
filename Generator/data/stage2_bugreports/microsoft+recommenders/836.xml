	<summary>[BUG] Current env setup can fail at pip if dependencies are missing</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

One of the pip packages depends on Bottleneck which when installed compiles c++ code, this fails on windows unless visual studio c++ binaries are installed and on linux if gcc is not installed. There is however a conda package for this which resolves these problems. We should move bottlneck to the conda packages so they can be installed properly prior to downstream pip packages building it.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Linux and Windows
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

need a fresh installation of windows / linux and try to build python conda env
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

conda env create works without requiring external libraries / tools
