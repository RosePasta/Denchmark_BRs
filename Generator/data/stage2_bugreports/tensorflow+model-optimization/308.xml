	<summary>Some errors on running the example: https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/blob/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/python/examples/quantization/keras/mnist_cnn.py</summary>

Describe the bug


After run the code to save the model, it complaints that: 'QuantizeAwareActivation' object has no attribute 'name'; So I add a self.name = ‘’ to the line 107 of quantize_aware_activation.py and i can save the model. But i think this is not a legal way to solve the issue.


Another error when covert the model to tflite with below code: Unknown activation function:
with quantize.quantize_scope():
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model_file(model_name)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CristXu&gt;@CristXu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for the report.
The  example is out of date. Please refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/blob/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/python/core/quantization/keras/quantize_functional_test.py&gt;quantize_functional_test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to see a good example of how to use the API with MNIST.
Regarding the failure, I was able to run the example locally and did not see any error with quantize_aware_activation being serialized. Are you using a different activation that it currently doesn't support? Could you please share the exact code you are running.
Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CristXu&gt;@CristXu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
QAT only supports TF 2.x. TensorFlow 1.x is not supported.
Please check API compatibility &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization/guide/quantization/training#api_compatibility&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
