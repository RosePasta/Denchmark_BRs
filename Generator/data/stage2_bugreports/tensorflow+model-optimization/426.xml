	<summary>Issue with loading quantization aware trained model</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Unable to load the saved model after applying quantization aware training.
System information
TensorFlow version (installed from source or binary): 2.2
TensorFlow Model Optimization version (installed from source or binary): 0.3.0

Please find the gist of the code here &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/peri044/00a477b73d01bd08ef3410c15679a91c#file-sample-py-L47&gt;https://gist.github.com/peri044/00a477b73d01bd08ef3410c15679a91c#file-sample-py-L47&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Error occurs at tf.keras.models.load_model() function.  If I replace this with tf.saved_model.load(), I see the same error too. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you !!
Error :

model = tf_load.load_internal(path, loader_cls=KerasObjectLoader)

 Can you please try with below changes
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; with tfmot.quantization.keras.quantize_scope():                                 
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('saved_model')  
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 - The code is working for me. Can you please try using  and try the code again? Also, consider using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/joyalbin&gt;@joyalbin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's snippet as well, though for , it should just work.

		Closing this for now since I was able to run the code without any issues, and it's likely a versioning issue.
Please feel free to reopen otherwise.

		Is there any workaround for tf 2.2 for this? I am using conda to install tensorflow and currently only version 2.2 is available for linux.
