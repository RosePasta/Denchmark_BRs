Describe the bug

 : how are you creating your batchnorm layer? In TF 2.1.0, the batchnorm layer class should be tensorflow.python.keras.layers.normalization_v2.BatchNormalization if you are using the tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization API.
If you are using tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.BatchNormalization in 2.1.0, that is currently not supported. I can update the documentation in that case.

  I didnt use compat.v1 but the keras model was saved using .h5 format. Now I tried to save in in default saved model format and loaded for it. I gave a different error aa below. Any suggestions.
Please initialize Prune with a supported layer. Layers should either be a PrunableLayer instance, or should be supported by the PruneRegistry. You passed: &lt;class 'tensorflow.python.keras.saving.saved_model.load.ZeroPadding2D'&gt;

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jkparuchuri&gt;@jkparuchuri&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Looks like the keras model was originally built in TF 1.X and saved using h5 and you are now reloading it in TF 2.X. This isn't a case I had considered actually and glad you brought it up. The same with regards to SavedModel (it uses different classes under the hood right now when compared to using the tf.keras.layers directly).
In the mean time, a workaround (without needing the original model architecture) would be to modify &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/blob/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/python/core/sparsity/keras/prune_registry.py#L82&gt;this file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and add a row below "layers.BatchNormalization: []" that says "tf.compat.v1.layers.BatchNormalization: []". Then build the pip package via &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization#installing-from-source&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization#installing-from-source&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Keep using the h5 model in that case.
If you're using one of the common vision models (e.g. mobilenet), that should suffice.
I'll consider what is appropriate for your case.

		Can you cd out of tensorflow_model_optimization into the model-optimization folder? Then run the same command.
I realized that the cd tensorflow_model_optimization instruction is incorrect. Should say cd model-optimization.

		python_version is available in bazel since 0.22.0 (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.22.0/be/python.html&gt;https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.22.0/be/python.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Do you think you'd be able to upgrade your version of bazel? I'll need to take a look at the TFMOT docs and clarify the minimum bazel version also.

  Thankyou, upgrading bazel resolved the building from source. But still see the same error even after adding to registry as you suggested :(
'PruneRegistry. You passed: {input}'.format(input=layer.class))

		I'd make sure that the tensorflow_model_optimization you're using is the one built from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization#installing-from-source&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization#installing-from-source&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with your change as opposed to the one you previously installed that MOT provided. I'm pretty confident what I suggested was correct.

  Able to resolve the issue.  Its "tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.BatchNormalization: []". keras was missing earlier in that line.

   Workaround is to add  to prune_registry at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/blob/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/python/core/sparsity/keras/prune_registry.py#L82&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/blob/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/python/core/sparsity/keras/prune_registry.py#L82&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and rebuild from source
