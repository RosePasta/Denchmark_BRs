	<summary>The example does not work,  got a error: 'QuantizeAwareActivation' object has no attribute '__name__'</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
After run the code to save the model, it complaints that: 'QuantizeAwareActivation' object has no attribute 'name'; So I add a self.name = ‘’ to the line 107 of quantize_aware_activation.py and i can save the model.  But i think this is not a legal way to solve the issue.
and My env is : tensorflow-gpu == 1.14.0 and the tensorflow_model_optimazation == 0.2.1 compiled from the newest github's code
Thanks for your help
Regards

		Please follow the bug template and as a part of it, provide a fully reproducible example (including a model).
It's not specific enough to know which "example" you are referring to.
1.14.0 will also not be supported at launch. Only 2.0+
