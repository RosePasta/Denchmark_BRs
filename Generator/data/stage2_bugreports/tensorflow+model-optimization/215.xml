	<summary>Pruning: Training with Near 100% Target Sparsity Fails</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Pruning with high target sparsity (e.g. 0.99) causes a error.
System information
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version: any
TensorFlow Model Optimization version: 0.2.1
Python version: any
Describe the expected behavior
Target sparsity of 0.99 should work.
Describe the current behavior
Training errors out with something like:
InvalidArgumentError: indices = -1 is not in [0, 40)
[[{{node prune_low_magnitude_dense_1/cond/cond/pruning_ops/GatherV2}}]]
Code to reproduce the issue
testPruneWithHighSparsity_Fails in prune_integration_test.py
Can search for "model-optimization/issues/215" in codebase to find unit test also.
