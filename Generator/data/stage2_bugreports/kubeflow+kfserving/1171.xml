	<summary>Istio dep upgrade breaks the cluster with existing virtual services</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
the new istio dep upgrade seems to break the cluster with existing virtual services that still uses the deprecated websocketUpgrade field.

		Good spot. We hit the same problem on Seldon so I should have remembered really - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/issues/1695&gt;SeldonIO/seldon-core#1695&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I remember we found a way to get it to tolerate the field. I think there was a flag somewhere. Will have to find what we did.

		Fix was this
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/commit/e7f4c7622f266be5a448b604e7b9adebfd752841&gt;SeldonIO/seldon-core@e7f4c76&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
