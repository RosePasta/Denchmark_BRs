	<summary>Inference service not sending cloud events.</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I deployed the flower-sample inferenceService along with a Knative Trigger and the event-display image as a Knative Service. After sending an inference request and receiving a response, the inferenceService doesn't send the cloud event to the default broker in the namespace. The logs from the inferenceservice-logger container in the pod that runs the inferenceService give me this:
{"level":"error","ts":1604353024.379209,"logger":"entrypoint","msg":"Failed to send log","URL":"http://default-broker.test","error":"while sending event: Post http://default-broker.test: dial tcp: lookup default-broker.test on 10.43.0.10:53: no such host","stacktrace":"github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/vendor/github.com/go-logr/zapr.(*zapLogger).Error\n\t/go/src/github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/vendor/github.com/go-logr/zapr/zapr.go:128\ngithub.com/kubeflow/kfserving/pkg/logger.(*Worker).Start.func1\n\t/go/src/github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/pkg/logger/worker.go:108"}
What did you expect to happen:
I expected the event display to receive a cloud event after an inference request.
Anything else you would like to add:
If I manually send a cloud event to the broker, it gets forwarded to the event-display normally.
Environment:

Knative eventing Version: 0.18
Kubeflow version:1.1
Kfdef:[k8s_istio]
Minikube version: n/a
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.16
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS

		Solution:
Use the url field to send the cloud events to an existing broker in your namespace.
In order for this to work you need KFserving 0.4 or later as previous versions don't work properly with cloud events v1.
Double-check your version of KFserving as kubeflow 1.1 comes by default with KFserving 0.3
