	<summary>Missing input.json file in v1beta1 rollout folder</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
While following the v1beta1 rollout sample instructions, I noticed that it references an input.json file which is missing from the folder.
What did you expect to happen:
I expected to find input.json in the docs/samples/v1beta1/rollout folder.
Anything else you would like to add:
The models used are the same as in v1alpha2 rollout sample, so the same input.json should work. It simply needs to be copied over.
