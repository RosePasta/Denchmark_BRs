	<summary>Error while indexing files</summary>
	<description>
I noticed that close to 6k photos were not indexing. So I ran "docker exec photoprism photoprism index" and I got the error "Error 1093: You can't specify target table 'photos' for update in FROM clause"
I am using a MySQL database

		Might be an issue with the SQL syntax or the database tables could be not be created automatically for any reason. Some more info is needed before debugging this further.

		It is installed via Docker. The version I'm running is 201021-33d36611-Linux-x86_64
It is definitely a SQL syntax error related to MySQL. &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=6980&gt;https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=6980&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		In fact, the &lt;denchmark-link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html&gt;MySQL manual&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says:

You cannot update a table and select directly from the same table in a subquery.

Just wow.
I'll push my changes for testing, but we need to verify how this affects large photo libraries. I'm confident this ugly workaround comes with a performance impact, just not sure if significant. The (much better) &lt;denchmark-link:https://mariadb.com/kb/en/derived-table-merge-optimization/&gt;MariaDB manual&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 warns "executing a subquery like this is very inefficient".

		Note: I'm going to take a look as some more issues before I start a new build for testing.

		Closing this since no negative test reports came in.
