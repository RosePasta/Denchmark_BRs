	<summary>Albums not matching actual folder structure</summary>
	<description>
Photoprism shows I have more than 13,000 folders in the albums tab. I may have when I originally imported things but I do not anymore. I went through a photo re-organizing and condensed to folders based on year only...so like 20 folders or so. I did a complete re-index in photoprism but still see &gt;13,000 folders. How would I reconcile this?

		Improved it, you'll need to index again (but not complete, so it should be fast). New Docker build available for testing soon!
