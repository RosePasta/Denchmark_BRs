	<summary>Invalid memory address during import</summary>
	<description>
I installed Photoprism from dockers in my Unraid machine, I needed to import 11.000 files so I placed everything under /mnt/user/media/library/photos/Import and run photoprism import. Everything was fine until I got this segmentation violation error message
docker-compose.yml
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;version: '3.3'

services:
  photoprism:
    image: photoprism/photoprism:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 2342:3242
    volumes:
      - "/mnt/user/media/library/photos:/srv/photoprism/photos" 
      - "/mnt/user/media/library/cache:/srv/photoprism/cache" 
      - "/mnt/user/media/library/database:/srv/photoprism/database" 
    environment:
      PHOTOPRISM_IMPORT_PATH: /srv/photoprism/photos/Import 
      PHOTOPRISM_EXPORT_PATH: /srv/photoprism/photos/Export 
      PHOTOPRISM_ORIGINALS_PATH: /srv/photoprism/photos/Originals
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Inside /mnt/user/media/library/photos I have Import, Export, Originals folders
Error message, instantly after photoprism import
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;INFO[2019-06-03T08:55:39-03:00] importing photos from /srv/photoprism/photos/Import

		Maybe not the latest Docker image? If you use the :latest tag, you need to explicitly pull a new one.
Issue should be fixed with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        if !m.dateCreated.IsZero() {
		return m.dateCreated
	}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

unless there is a way that m or m.dateCreated are nil in this function, see mediafile.go line 137. I'll investigate this if updating doesn't help.

		not sure how to check if latest or not, but I installed this docker container yesterday for the first time so it should be the latest. Is there a way to check which is the file giving this error? I couldn't find nothing in the logs

		Might be a special condition when date information is missing / corrupted... I've seen this before and thought I fixed it.


Can you run photoprism version and send the output?


Can you test importing just a single file or the file that caused the error and then send it to us via email, google drive or dropbox for debugging?


Note that we don't have a stable release yet. This is just for testing as data structures might change and you can lose data during upgrades (when using development versions).

		photoprism -v
PhotoPrism version 190530-c7f426a-Linux-x86_64

Well, I see now. It was a .mov file which it was trying to import. Is there a way to skip video files?

 That explains why there was an error... we don't support videos yet and it's completely not tested. Most of them probably don't have proper Exif headers we can index, so we should skip them for now (at least the indexing part).
		</comment>
		<comment id='6' author='jtomasrl' date='2019-06-03T23:40:54Z'>
		yeah makes sense. I tried it a .HEIC file and same problem. Is it just jpeg, raw and png supported?
		</comment>
		<comment id='7' author='jtomasrl' date='2019-06-03T23:43:57Z'>
		Only tested with JPEG and RAW. Non-media files should be skipped. PNG, GIF etc doesn't make much sense as these are typically used for screenshots and animated web graphics, not photography. They also don't contain Exif meta data.

		<comment id='8' author='jtomasrl' date='2019-06-03T23:46:52Z'>
		Indexing and importing are different BTW. Non-media files are skipped during import, but it's well possible that we try to index them if they are already in the photos directory for any reason. So at the end of the day we have to filter out everything that doesn't make sense there or that is not readable.

		yeah, those are giving problem too. I have a few thousand .HEIC files from
my iphone

		We have a ticket for HEIF: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/63&gt;#63&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I checked last, there was no native golang library for working with HEIF images. We need to solve that. Help (incl research and tests) is most welcome.

		It would really help to have a file that causes this error.

		I'll love to help, but I have no idea of golang. Anyways, I can contribute with an image which causes the error
