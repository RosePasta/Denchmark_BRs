	<summary>Error while indexing photos with date before 1970</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
first of all I want to express big thanks to the work that was done during the last days. Good work!
I get error messages while indexing pictures

Only 4 out of 12 photos were indexed, so the local path should be correctly mapped.
I'm using  the latest docker image. If you need further information, please ask.

		Did you create a new database?
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://twitter.com/browseyourlife/status/1206833437514043393&gt;https://twitter.com/browseyourlife/status/1206833437514043393&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I've started from scratch: latest docker image from yesterday, new container and new import and indexing of photos, but error messages still remain.  When updating the image for existing containers: Can I recreate the database with photoprism migrate command ?
Is indexing also depending on succcesfull reverse geocoding ?

		You can simply delete the files in the resources/database directory if you use the built-in server. Server should not run while doing this, not sure what happens if it keeps running. Probably panic or will create new files again.

Maybe an issue with our optimized indexer, but need some more time / information to figure this out.
Certainly photo_id should not be empty if you want to add labels to a photo. Makes sense.

		If you think this is an issue specifically with your files, we would appreciate a sample (ideally upload it and send the download URL, either here or private via email to &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:hello@photoprism.org&gt;hello@photoprism.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		I guess, I've found a hint: Some of my (scanned  from original) photos are older than the date 01.01.1970., so for example: 25.08.1967 12:00:00. As I know the unix timestamp so far, it starts at the described date.
One error message is:
(/go/src/github.com/photoprism/photoprism/internal/photoprism/indexer_mediafile.go:174)
[2019-12-18 15:54:38]  Error 1292: invalid time format: '{1967 8 25 11 0 0 0}'

 Would you be able to provide us with an example file? Otherwise it will be a ping-pong with many test releases until we fixed it. Or you send a pull request with a fix :)
