	<summary>UI issue when thumbnail is missing</summary>
	<description>
When a thumbnail is missing for a photo/video, all the following thumbnails end up opening incorrect photos when they are clicked. I was able to reproduce the issue on the demo site.
Go to https://demo.photoprism.org/photos?view=cards&amp;order=similar&amp;public=true&amp;quality=3 and notice that the first thumbnail is missing. Clicking on any of the other photos to enlarge them opens the wrong photo.

I notice a lot of missing thumbnails for live photo (videos) when grouping by similar.

		How did you manage to remove the thumbnail on the demo? Did you hack the API and/or is this a second bug? I can see a thumb in the edit dialog, just not in search results...

		I actually didn't have to do anything in th demo, so I guess it's another bug. I think it happens for videos/live photos in my instance.

		Nevermind, figured it out. Had to change a few things to make "group by similarity" work with videos, same for search by color.
