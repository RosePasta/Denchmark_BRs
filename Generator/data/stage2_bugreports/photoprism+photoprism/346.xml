	<summary>Import folder selection not updated according to folder structure on disk</summary>
	<description>
The import (newly named: copy) function within library section provides the user to choose the folder that the user wants to import.
After upgrading to PhotoPrism™ 200601-716012a-Linux-x86_64, the folders as located in “~/Pictures/Import:/photoprism/import“ on disk do not seem to be reflected as a choice to the user.
The system seems to only show the initial state of folders when a database clean-up (‘rm -r storage/*’) is performed.
Problem not seen with earlier versions.
The problem could not be resolved following these steps:

logout and login
enforce browser refresh
change browser

Steps to reproduce:
OK:

Clean system, start with fresh system (‘rm -r storage/*’)
Go to Library -&gt; Copy -&gt; Drop/Down menu
=&gt; The folders listed to user are reflecting the status as on disk
Change folder structure within import folder on disk

NOK

Go to Library -&gt; Copy -&gt; Drop/Down menu
=&gt; The list of selectable folder is still the same as from step 2 and does not update according to changes made on disk

System details:
PhotoPrism™ 200601-716012a-Linux-x86_64
