		Hi, I've been testing around this week with photoprism this week, so I'm also a new user. As I'm using Windows OS as client operating system , I always start with an abosolut path like C:/pictures:/home....... .  The ~ symbol presents current directory of user.
You have to share drive C: or whatsoever in Docker and configure the service for using Linux Containers

		Yes, maybe ~ in the docker compose config can be an issue on some operating systems. Was this Windows? We've never tested our app on Windows so far.
PS: Sorry for the delay, I had to complete a commercial project to fund this. Development continues soon!

		Hi, yes I've tested with Windows 10. When I'm using ~ , I am directed to my home drive C:\Users\xxxx.
Also ./ doesn't work for me. If you store the photos in your home drive , it might work, otherwise the absolut path somewhere on the laptop like E:\mypictures\holidays:....... as part of the volume mount works definitly.

 Did you check the volumes section in the docker-compose.yml? Not sure if imports / exports is mounted by default... if you're using it in development mode, the folders would be within your code / repo directory and not in home.

		I have the same issue on my Linux Mint. I did not change anything in my docker-compose.yml.

		I had the same issue using photoprism/photoprism:20190927.
I am new to Photoprism but seems found a workaround.
Try
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  volumes:
      - "~/Photos:/home/photoprism/Pictures" # [local path]:[container path]
      - "photoprism-cache:/home/photoprism/.cache/photoprism" # keep thumbnail cache
      - "photoprism-database:/home/photoprism/.local/share/photoprism/resources/database" # keep database files
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I can confirm this bug.
It occurs, when /home/photoprism/Pictures/Import/upload/ and /home/photoprism/Pictures/Originals/ are not on the same filesystem.
The problem is caused by the use of :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/internal/photoprism/mediafile.go#L438&gt;https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/internal/photoprism/mediafile.go#L438&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

A possible fix is to copy and then delete the file, if it needs to be moved between filesystems as stated here:

 Thanks for your feedback! Makes sense, that's why we didn't find this with our tests.
Maybe we can just fall back to copying if it's a different file system.

 Can you please tests again?
Build is running, should be available on Docker hub in about one hour (if tests don't fail), see
&lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.org/photoprism/photoprism/builds/619262937&gt;https://travis-ci.org/photoprism/photoprism/builds/619262937&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 You're right, hard to verify in our dev environment as we don't have different filesystems for testing... on our list. Hopefully fixed now, build is running.
