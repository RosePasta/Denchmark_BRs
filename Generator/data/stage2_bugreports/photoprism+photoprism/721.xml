	<summary>Albums are lost on re-install</summary>
	<description>
If I remove and reinstall the docker instance of photoprism I lose all album information. I do not modify anything between removal and reinstall.

If I check mariadb I can see the photos_albums, and album tables are properly filled out before remove/reinstall.

After removal and reinstall I log into photoprism from my browser and re-scan (Complete Rescan NOT selected) then I can see some previous albums (not all), the the photos_albums is empty.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16420413/102643372-8530b000-41a2-11eb-9f21-31e2c1336650.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but also no albums show up in the albums page.

I'm concerned that upgrading to newer versions would also cause a loss of album information.
I use the ARM64 (odroid N2+) image with mariadb.

		Thanks for reporting this! We're currently working on YAML backup files for albums - maybe this is related... what specific versions were you using, and upgrading to?
Obviously I tested this (just did it again) and it works for me. Does it also happen using our latest development build?
If you've upgraded from a much older version, it's possible that the database schema changed too much in the meantime. We've been continuously adding new features and don't have the resources to provide a guaranteed upgrade path between every single development version. That's why we're about to release a stable version that also comes with YAML backups in case the database gets lost.

		Did you re-index? Photo and video metadata is was still there after upgrading, only the albums were missing?

		I'm sorry, the versions were the ones available yesterday (photoprims/mariadb), though I can see the docker has been updated 2 hours ago. I'm not sure how to find the specific version (PhotoPrismÂ® 201217-3c973730-Linux-aarch64)?
The photos are still there after re-index, the library (web view) is empty until re-index on reinstall.
I'm not sure if the metadata was preserved since I made no changes to them.
This is not an upgrade, I only started testing this out yesterday.

		If there were no search results after re-installation and you had to re-index, it seems the complete database was lost rather than just the albums specifically? Please make sure to use a permanent volume for storing the database in this case.
That's exactly what our new YAML backup files for albums will solve. The are a few config changes when upgrading (you may now also set the most important config options directly in Settings without editing your Docker config):
&lt;denchmark-link:https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/docker-compose.yml&gt;https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/docker-compose.yml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What changed? Instead of asking our users to enable JSON and YAML files for best results, we enable them by default and offer disable flags in case they don't want this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_BACKUPS: "false"            # Don't backup photo and album metadata to YAML files
PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_WEBDAV: "false"             # Disable built-in WebDAV server
PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_SETTINGS: "false"           # Users can not view or change settings
PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_PLACES: "false"             # Disables reverse geocoding and maps
PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_EXIFTOOL: "false"           # Don't create ExifTool JSON files for improved metadata extraction
PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_TENSORFLOW: "false"         # Don't use TensorFlow for image classification
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Yep, this is wrong (no permanent volume at the MySQL/MariaDB storage location, which is /var/lib/mysql):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;volumes:
      - "/usbdrives/OldSSD/photoprism/mysql"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Anonymous volume as shown in our example config at &lt;denchmark-link:https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/docker-compose.yml&gt;https://dl.photoprism.org/docker/docker-compose.yml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;volumes:
      - "/var/lib/mysql"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Option B) External folder mounted as permanent storage:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;volumes:
      - "/usbdrives/OldSSD/photoprism/mysql:/var/lib/mysql"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I tried the newer image from today, and repeated my steps (remove, reinstall) and this seems to solve the issue:
volumes:
- "/usbdrives/OldSSD/photoprism/mysql:/var/lib/mysql"
Thank you!
