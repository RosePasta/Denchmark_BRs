	<summary>No zip download possible for shared links</summary>
	<description>
When using a shared link I'm only able to download single pictures. When selecting multiple images and clicking on the download button, a login is required.
Is there a way to enable the download of multiple files for shared links OR to disable the download button, when multiple images are selected?
