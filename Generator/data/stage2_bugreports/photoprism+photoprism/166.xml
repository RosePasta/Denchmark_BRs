	<summary>OSM: Extracting location information from GPS coordinates ignores `village` property</summary>
	<description>
First of all, thank you for this awesome project!
While testing it on my photo collection I noticed that some location labels look a bit weird, so I started investigating and realized that Photoprism seems to ignore the  property of the  object while parsing OSM's response, falling back to . This causes photos taken in a village to have incomplete location labels. (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/1e7c0c243550e6b2b251455efcc06779efcce2e0/internal/maps/osm/location.go#L75&gt;Code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) &lt;denchmark-link:https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Reverse/&gt;Nominatim's documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fails to mention the  property, but you can see it in their examples.

 Note that you shouldn't index too many photos as OSM does not allow batch processing, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://twitter.com/liotier/status/1207989846159036416&gt;https://twitter.com/liotier/status/1207989846159036416&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We're currently working on our own geolocation service.
