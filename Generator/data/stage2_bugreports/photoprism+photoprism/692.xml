	<summary>moments: near \"INNER\": syntax error (update folder dates) &amp; (update album dates)</summary>
	<description>
I have created a docker container on a QNAP NAS running the latest version of their Container Station ("docker") platform.
When I am doing an import of photo's, I am seeing these errors flagged in the log.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;time="2020-12-10T03:08:04+08:00" level=error msg="moments: near \"INNER\": syntax error (update folder dates)"

time="2020-12-10T03:08:04+08:00" level=info msg="Import completed in 34 s"                                                                  
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Let me know what additional information you may need to troubleshoot this.

		Should be fixed with the next build. Only affected SQLite. Disabled the query there until we have a working alternative.
