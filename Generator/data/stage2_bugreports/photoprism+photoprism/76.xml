	<summary>Photo like/dislike API must return OK (200) instead of Accepted (202)</summary>
	<description>
DislikePhoto and LikePhoto should return http.StatusOK (200) instead of http.StatusAccepted (202) as requests are not handled asynchronously (StatusAccepted means the request was received, but the data will be changed later/asynchronously).
Code in the following two files needs to be changed:

https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/internal/api/photos_test.go
