	<summary>WebDAV: Improve UX of remote directory autocomplete</summary>
	<description>
Related: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/301&gt;#301&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

As mentioned in  this issue, PhotoPrism uses an inefficient way to fetch remote directory structure, which could causes high resource usage on the NC server and potentially failure/timeout. However, manually entering the remote directory sync directory works, but only after the timeout (~10min).
It would be nice to see PhotoPrism improve the directory fetching function for a better UX. (and maybe with the option to directly enter the directory name before fetching?)

		Implemented a 45s timeout. Does this work for now?

		The timeout works really well! And it remembers the directory I last inputted!
