	<summary>Commas in folder names cause autogenerated "folder albums" to come up empty.</summary>
	<description>
To reproduce: When importing a folder with a comma in the name, the photos are imported fine. However, the auto-generated album that shows up Sidebar &gt; Albums &gt; Folders shows no photos.
This is running the latest photoprism docker container.
