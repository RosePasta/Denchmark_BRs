	<summary>GPS location not correctly imported</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
The current latest version of photoprism (200729-65c57f5-Linux-x86_64) fails to correctly import the GPS coordinates of many of my images. Other tools (e.g. exiftool) correctly extract this information.
I have tried setting  to  as suggested in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/302&gt;#302&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but this did not solve the issue. I have attached one of the problematic pictures to this issue.
This is the output when importing the image:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;photoprism_1     | time="2020-07-29T15:22:05Z" level=debug msg="exif: interface conversion: interface {} is []exifcommon.Rational, not []uint8 in IMG_20161216_154531.jpg (gps info)"
photoprism_1     | time="2020-07-29T15:22:05Z" level=info msg="metadata: failed parsing gps coordinates in IMG_20161216_154531.jpg (exif)"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1470363/88819425-43d24080-d1c0-11ea-9663-c3fcf84c1abe.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please let me know whether you need any more information.
Kind regards,
Ren√©

 Is this something that needs to be fixed in go-exif? On vacation right now, so I can't properly debug it.

		Looks like PP is mis-casting the value that's coming back. I should be able to throw together a PR against PP later tonight.

		Log points to an error returned by go-exif. As mentioned, can't debug it properly right now. Thankful for any pull request or advice!

		Another example of multiple instances of the same tag with different types. Now, we will just skip tags with types that don't agree with the standard. This should fix most of the instances that we see.

 While this specific image seems to work, many of our tests are failing now - especially one file modified with Photoshop, which was working perfectly before. Date, Location, Lens,... everything gone 
Any idea why that is? Exiftool still shows the correct values.

		Not sure. It was a solid that account for a certain image glitch, and it didn't break any unit-tests (including tests against my own images) .
Can you provide a couple of images?

		It's not specific to GPS locations. The process is crashing because of unknown tags in those images. The last change that I pushed (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dsoprea/go-exif/commit/74a1612f20425914ea5ad75ab03b0bac350a094c#diff-5965bde93fe619b40111a6fb9b6a2f28R249&gt;dsoprea/go-exif@74a1612#diff-5965bde93fe619b40111a6fb9b6a2f28R249&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) required that we lookup our type-information for our tags so that we can skip any that deviate from the standard so we don't run into undefined scenarios. However, that then fails if those tags aren't known and I wasn't handling that. Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dsoprea/go-exif/commit/089aa48c91e6c40383764367ec933a4b0ca020c7&gt;dsoprea/go-exif@089aa48&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Keep in mind that you should pull updates to go-jpeg/png/tiff, too, as those are very important to you.
