	<summary>Floating button misaligned on Firefox</summary>
	<description>
Hi there,
There is some misalignment on Firefox with the floating button on bottom right.
This doesn't seem to happen with Chromium (I don't really know for other web browsers, Linux here).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10376004/49109985-7eb5ff80-f28c-11e8-93f4-f95956575f57.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After fix on the left, before fix on the right
Regarding &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/5741&gt;this issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on Vuetify, it's just two lines in CSS that are not in the correct order. In PhotoPrism, those lines are also not in the correct order.
Merge request on its way! :)
