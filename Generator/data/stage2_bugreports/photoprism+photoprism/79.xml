Maybe models are not properly initialized? Check GORM docs and compare to other code.

		Maybe it is not GORM related? I see that following change has been made
to      const DataURL = "&lt;denchmark-link:https://dl.photoprism.org/fixtures/photos.zip&gt;https://dl.photoprism.org/fixtures/photos.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
"
from const DataURL = "&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.dropbox.com/s/na9p9wwt98l7m5b/import.zip?dl=1&gt;https://www.dropbox.com/s/na9p9wwt98l7m5b/import.zip?dl=1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, when we look at the download server, only demo.zip and test.zip are there.  In this case, no photo record will be created thus return NULL （‘0000-00-00’）

		Test fixtures are cached in /tmp (only the file hash is compared, not the original download URL). You can pull / merge again, I changed the file name a few times. Should exist, worked for me. We have our own download server now.
I've seen the error before somewhere else, it was easy to fix... not quite sure what it was.

		In fact, tests failed whenever database was empty as there was not photo with ID 1. We need to create default test fixtures that are there from the start.
