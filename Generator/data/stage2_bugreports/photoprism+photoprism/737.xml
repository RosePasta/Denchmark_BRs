	<summary>Auto Capitalization after Apostrophes</summary>
	<description>
It seems like indexing is auto-capitalizing letters after apostrophes. In the screenshot below you can see the file path folder is "Boston New Year's" with a lowercase "s" however the generated folder name is changing it to "Boston New Year'S" with an uppercase "S".

		Shouldn't happen according to our tests... Might be a frontend issue...

		Are you sure this a regular ' apostrophe or might it actually be something similar like ` ?

		Definitely a regular apostrophe and not a `. Read-only mode pulling from a path on my nextcloud server. I SSH'd into the files directory to confirm on there as well:
"Boston New Year's" is how it appears.

		Excellent catch! Found it. Note that this fix won't update titles of already indexed folders.
