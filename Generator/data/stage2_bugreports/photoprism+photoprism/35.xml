	<summary>Support symlinks</summary>
	<description>
Currently photoprism attempts to create the directory, this fails if the folder is a symlink and thus refuses to start.

 This shouldn't happen of course, but you also shouldn't need to use a link: You can configure all directories in docker-compose.yml - did you try that?

		My NAS has several folders where one is Pictures, that is suppose to be the Import folder. However as i need to define /Photos, and /Photos/Import is used as a sub-directory, /Photo will essentially point to the root of my NAS. This isn't ideal to hand docker access into, thus I'd like to much rather symlink it to somewhere else.

		In fact, you can set all directories individually, they don't have to be sub-directories. That's just the default. You can also mount more than one volume:
  volumes:
      - ~/Photos:/Photos # change ~/Photos to whatever directory you want to use on your local computer
      - photoprism-thumbnails:/var/photoprism/thumbnails # keep this (thumbnail cache)
  environment:
      PHOTOPRISM_IMPORT_PATH: "/Photos/Import" # ~/Photos/Import (files to be imported to originals)
      PHOTOPRISM_EXPORT_PATH: "/Photos/Export" # ~/Photos/Export (files exported from originals)
      PHOTOPRISM_ORIGINALS_PATH: "/Photos/Originals" # ~/Photos/Originals (original jpeg, raw and meta files)

		According to this issue,  should work with symlinks: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/1149&gt;golang/go#1149&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
