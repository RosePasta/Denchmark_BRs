	<summary>Inception V3 model uses 299px resolution, not just 224px</summary>
	<description>
Our model expects to get square 299x299 RGB images, right now we use 224px as this was the case for a different model. Needs to be fixed. Ideally we can reuse the 299px thumbnail for other tasks like color indexing.

		Apparently we were using Inception V1, not V3. That explains the difference. Bad memory.
