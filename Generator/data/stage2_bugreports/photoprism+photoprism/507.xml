	<summary>Mosaic view only shows around 50 videos</summary>
	<description>
Current behaviour: In the mosaic view in the video section only around 50 videos are shown. In the other views everything is working as expected.
Expected behaviour: In case there are more than 50 videos all MUST be shown in the video section using mosaic view.

		New Docker images available for testing! Note that the password will be reset to its initial state when upgrading. Our Docker images have been optimized for common NAS models. You can now set a specific user and group using the UID and GID environment variables. Feedback welcome.
