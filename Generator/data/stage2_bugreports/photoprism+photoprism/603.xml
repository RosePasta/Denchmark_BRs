	<summary>Videos: Some avc1 files can't be played in Safari</summary>
	<description>
When clicking a video in Safari (mobile and desktop), the lightbox video player pops up but is black with the error;
Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not found
Below the error is a Download File link which correctly downloads the video.
Doing the same thing on Chrome or Firefox successfully plays the video in the popup player.
The popup player in Safari correctly shows the popup in portrait or landscape depending on the video.
This happens on all videos such as .mp4 files from an iPhone (MPEG-4 AVC).

		We need to debug this further. Video files are more complex than images, especially in that there are multiple container &amp; codec formats that can be combined. Not all combinations supported on all devices / browsers.

		For further debugging, it will be helpful to get the video file metadata as JSON, grouped by type:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;exiftool -g -j FILENAME
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Notes:

I tested the same file in PhotoStructure and FileRun using Safari and it plays.
I've left the GPS info in because it's a public place and non identifying.

		That's strange, avc1 files should work. Just tested it with Safari. Can you also provide up with a test file? If you like via email to &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:hello@photoprism.org&gt;hello@photoprism.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or post a link where we can download it :)

		I've just spent a lot of time improving video transcoding. Let us know if you still have issues after upgrading. Also try re-indexing your videos.
Fresh Docker images available very soon: &lt;denchmark-link:https://drone.photoprism.app/photoprism/photoprism/&gt;https://drone.photoprism.app/photoprism/photoprism/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks. I pulled the new image and reindexed but still have the issue. I've emailed an example video to &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:hello@photoprism.org&gt;hello@photoprism.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the subject .
Normally I'd assume it was an issue with my setup but the fact it plays on Photoprism in Chrome suggests otherwise. Anyway, hopefully I'm not being dumb and wasting your time!

		Works for me... latest build uses a more explicit content type header... if you just pulled, you should already have it... maybe a system or browser setting, that gets in your way? I know mov avc1 files don't play in every browser, but Safari and Chrome work for me on a Mac:

		Thanks for testing. I just tried a different mac with macOS 10.15.2 and Safari 13.0.4 to see if I had a system/browser setting getting in the way. I also tried a different ISP. I've tried accessing Photoprism through my reverse proxy and locally. The video just never plays in Safari. When I click the play button I get the following logs;
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;time="2020-12-13T00:45:07Z" level=debug msg="GET /api/v1/videos/d87ff8054ad2a419e286693c71a78deb0d1c96a9/public/avc (206) [2.339848ms]"

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I will try setting up PhotoPrism from scratch and testing with this single video but other than that I just can't think what could be the problem.

		Apologies, it is now working! I can only think that even though I pulled the new image and reupped the container, it didn't use the new image. Overnight, Watchtower must have recreated the container using the new image because everything now works. Settings &gt; About page now shows;
