		Our tests are green. Unclear if it's a known issue with darktable-cli (doesn't like to be executed from goroutines like during import) or a new issue. Needs further investigation. I'm off until Monday, wouldn't be sad if somebody can have a look - otherwise I'll do it next week.

		Might be due to a fix I added to import_worker.go recently: Files other than JPEG were not indexed properly after importing them, you had to run index manually

		It would be possible that another goroutine now imports a newly created JPEG if your import directory contains non-JPEG files that need to be converted first. However, I'm 90% sure filepath.Walk() does not iterate over files added later.
No idea why m should be nil in photoprism/mediafile.go:307:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;func (m *MediaFile) Filename() string {
	return m.filename
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Done. It took me a while to reproduce this with a photo that I could actually share.
Also, at first I thought this could be because I was running this on a very small machine, so I moved this to a node with 16GB of ram and 4 cores and it crashed too.

		The error is Data too long for column 'photo_exposure' at row 1
Fixed that a while ago, but you need to delete your db (will be recreated automatically) or increase the size of this column manually. Check our GitHub issues, you'll find other related tickets.

		Maybe you can clear the sensitive image contents with Photoshop? Probably has to do with format, sidecar files or metadata, not with the image itself.

		It's a known issue with the JPEG implementation of Go:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10447&gt;golang/go#10447&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We can improve the error message however. Does it affect many important images for you?
Of course we could implement a fallback to another tool in case of read errors, but I'm not sure if this must be part of our first release...

		Sure... it's fine if some images can't be indexed, as long as there is good logging AND the indexing/importing process does not crash. Otherwise you need to be running and re-running photoprism import

		I'll check out the crashing, this should not happen... probably because we use a pointer somewhere to access a thumbnail that isn't there. Hope you can test again later as I didn't have issues with nil pointers for a long time over here.

 Ok, think I found it... might also happen when there is no main file for some reason... for example because conversion failed or it is not readable. Added nil checks and some more logging, hope this works for you!
We should think about what should happen when there are only sidecar files or videos. Maybe some of your errors are related to video files? We don't have video support yet, but found a sponsor for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/17&gt;#17&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
