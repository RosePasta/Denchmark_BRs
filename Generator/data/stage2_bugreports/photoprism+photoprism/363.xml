Photoprism 200616-ee86bed-Linux-x86_64 (latest Docker photoprism/photoprism)
When loading the /places route directly the JS tries to access &lt;denchmark-link:https://api.maptiler.com/maps//style.json&gt;https://api.maptiler.com/maps//style.json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 without the map style set. When loading via link(clicking an object) it works as intended.

		Interesting, works for me in develop (public mode). Might only happen when authentication is turned on, so it's an initialization problem when certain config data is only available after loading the maps.

		yes. the container uses the ootb default settings so that auth is turned on
