	<summary>Sporadically: "Month" not properly shown in details view</summary>
	<description>
For some photos that got imported, PP does not show the proper value of the month within photo's details view.
The field remains empty, while remaining fields seem to be filled properly.
The error occurred for several photos imported in local PP instance, as well as at least for one - if not more - photos as in public PP demo.
Trigger for the problem is unknown.
Steps to reproduce:
OK:
Import Photos to PP
NOK
Check Photos' details: Navigation bar "Photos" -&gt; select impacted photo(s) -&gt; select "edit" -&gt; select "Details"
Example as from local instance:

		Thank you for reporting this! Will be fixed. Not sure when exactly, since we're on vacation for the next couple of days.

		There is no more file on my system running version 200812-f737edb-Linux-x86_64 which is having the problem.
Also on PP demo the problem seems to be resolved.
Thanks a lot!
