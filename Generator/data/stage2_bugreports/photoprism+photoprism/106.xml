	<summary>[Bug] Long file_name not supported</summary>
	<description>
I maintain an extensive photo collection via git-annex; think of it as a distributed git-LFS without lock-in to a single file source. It checks symlinks into Git and maintains the content outside of main Git; by default it refers to said files via a content hash.
Trying your latest docker image, I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[2019-04-24 03:23:20]  
Added main jpg file ".git/annex/objects/00/v8/SHA512E-s129561--70c0b10e5f36e64acfdfeda1ec35e6ddedb903a1240cbfe2bc145ef971129e709e460b7026d5fe2332b5ec0f8bb58a7a47347ccbac19e5ef70634355d956329e.JPG/SHA512E-s129561--70c0b10e5f36e64acfdfeda1ec35e6ddedb903a1240cbfe2bc145ef971129e709e460b7026d5fe2332b5ec0f8bb58a7a47347ccbac19e5ef70634355d956329e.JPG"
No location: lat and long are missing in metadata

(Error 1406: Data too long for column 'file_name' at row 1) 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thanks for reporting this. How many chars should we allow for file names? 65,535 is the max for MySQL.

		4096 chars should work, that's the max for most Linux file systems. OS X seems limited to 1024 chars.

		Error on CI:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(Error 1071: Specified key was too long; max key length is 3072 bytes)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Please test. Seems like MySQL doesn't work with (much) more than 512 chars if you use 4 byte UTF-8 (required for emojis). TiDB is more powerful. PhotoPrism should work with both.

		Sorry, very much under the water...

Will the current docker work to test this?

		I just merged to master. Our Docker images get updated automatically, if all tests are green. They are tagged with the build date, so you can see how old they are.
