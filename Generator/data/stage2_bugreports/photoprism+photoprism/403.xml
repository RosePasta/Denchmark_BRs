When you symlink folders into /originals, the indexer will happily pick them up but /api/v1/folders/originals will return 0 results.
The  function, which is used to display folders, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/0a4dc155e6c259437122790769bc6715fe3b0bd0/internal/query/folders.go#L12&gt;uses&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , which &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/0a4dc155e6c259437122790769bc6715fe3b0bd0/pkg/fs/dirs.go#L96-L97&gt;only uses&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  to determine whether something is a directory or not.
I think this logic should either read the folders from the folders table or use the same logic to traverse the filesystem that the indexer does, to avoid inconsistencies.

		Closing this since there was no more feedback. Seems to work.
