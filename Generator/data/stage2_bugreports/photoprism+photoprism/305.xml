	<summary>Incorrect date for a photo</summary>
	<description>
I pulled latest docker image today and imported a few older photos. They were captured in 2003 however they are displayed as made in year 2020. Please find attached a JSON file for one of the photos.

		 and  are missing from what I see in your JSON file. Not sure if &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dsoprea/go-exif&gt;https://github.com/dsoprea/go-exif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 knows , &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dsoprea&gt;@dsoprea&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Added a fallback today, in case it can be found: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/internal/meta/exif.go#L308&gt;https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/internal/meta/exif.go#L308&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Does it work with our latest Docker image?
The only file that still didn't work for me what a resized version of your files I created with Photoshop. Not sure if this edge case is a "must have" for a first release.

		Yes, it does work with the latest version, thanks!
I also used exiftool to create "DateTimeOriginal" attribute based on "ModifyDate":
exiftool "-DateTimeOriginal&lt;ModifyDate" *.jpg -overwrite_original
