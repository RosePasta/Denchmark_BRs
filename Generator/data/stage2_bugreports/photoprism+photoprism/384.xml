	<summary>Support triggering the lightbox from the Places view.</summary>
	<description>
Doesn't appear to be able to trigger the lightbox from the Places view.
At the moment, double clicking on a marker on the map, e.g. Europe with 100 photos, zooms into a lower-level, e.g. Germany with 50 photos, and France with 50 photos. This is handy, but would also be good if it were possible to launch the lightbox into a view of all the photos that are 'selected' by the region indicated by the marker, just not sure how to preserve the double-click to zoom functionality - maybe have a pop-out on hover that takes you to the lightbox if clicked?

		Thanks! For performance reasons, we have less data in this view. Need to make it work with fuzzy dates.

		You can test this as soon as new Docker images have been pushed, max 2 hours.

		I've just pulled the latest image but I don't see any additional UI elements that provide an affordance for launching the lightbox from a map marker? Clicking (or double clicking) a marker just seems to zoom further into the map, which I think is valuable behaviour, but would like to be able to open the lightbox for the one or many photos that the marker represents.

		Ah, my apologies. I thought that docker-compose pull would be sufficient to upgrade my stack, but I had to down and up... not just up on a stopped stack. Anyway, I have tested this and I see that it is working... clicking on a marker that encapsulates multiple photos zooms in, and when you are at the level of single photos, clicking on the marker takes you to that photo. Excellent!
As a post-MVP feature, I think it would be great if there was still some pop-out affordance when a map marker summarises multiple photos if you could go to a lightbox view that would load only those photos in that area.

		You can use the search field to limit results (also in the lightbox) to a country, city, or other keyword.
