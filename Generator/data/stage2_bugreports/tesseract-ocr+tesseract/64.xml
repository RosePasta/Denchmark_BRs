	<summary>box.train completes with no errors but does not create .tr output</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm running 3.05.00dev on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
When running:
tesseract eng.Arial.exp0.tif eng.Arial.exp0 box.train
I'm getting a simple one-line output:
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v3.05.00dev with Leptonica
However, no .tr output file is created (anywhere in the filesystem).
My work dir listing is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Arial.ttf
common.punc
eng.Arial.exp0.box
eng.Arial.exp0.tif
training-text.txt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Running with gdb doesn't give anything additional.
Anything I can look for for extra info? Any ideas what might be causing this?
Thanks

		I'm having exactly the same problem than danageva with the same version but over OS X. Apparently zdenop closed the issue with a deletion in two files. I don't have those lines in my installed version. Can you help me please?

		You should provide more details.

I have the latest code from the repo.

Which commit exactly, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/1826ac140b30a0f271726cbcbdc49a10eae80387&gt;1826ac1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
What OS do you use and the specific version of this OS. For example: Ubuntu 14.04, OS X 10.11, Windows 10.
Also, please provide the exact command you used and attach as zip file the tif and box files.

My guess is that you didn't install  tesseract properly.
Did you run all these commands last time you installed  tesseract?

./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-cube
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
make training
sudo make training-install

, could you try this command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;gdb --args tesseract ult.dejavu.exp0.tif ult.dejavu.exp0 box.train
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(Enter run on the gdb command line, and when it reports an error info stack)

Does this command produce ult.txt and ult.hocr ?
Maybe you should try to set TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable or use --tessdata-dir parameter.

Why it wants to load the "osd" language?

And one more question: when I configure tesseract with --prefix option, I expect tesseract to be smart enough to know where my data are. Why do I have to set TESSDATA_PREFIX variable explicitly?

		<comment id='19' author='danageva' date='2016-01-28T12:43:16Z'>
		Setting TESSDATA_PREFIX is not needed as long as your tessdata directory is at the right place ($PREFIX/share/tessdata).
osd.traineddata will be used for auto orientation and script detection, no matter which language you have selected.
