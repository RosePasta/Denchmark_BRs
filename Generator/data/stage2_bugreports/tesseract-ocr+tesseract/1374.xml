&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Tesseract Version: 4.0.0-beta.1-16-g4b2bea7
Commit Number: 4b2bea
Platform: CentOS Linux 7 64-bit

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Install tesseract from git source
Tesseract tools was installed fine
But compile training tools when exec
make training
occur
boxchar.cpp:67:42: error: 'U_RIGHT_TO_LEFT_ISOLATE' was not declared in this scope dir == U_ARABIC_NUMBER || dir == U_RIGHT_TO_LEFT_ISOLATE) {
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Suggested Fix:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Remove the code?
 || dir == U_RIGHT_TO_LEFT_ISOLATE
Does have any effect?

Do you have the additional dependencies required for building training tools?

The training tools need icu version 52 and up. The icu version in RHEL &amp; CentOS 7 is 50.

  Please check if it works on Centos7.

		 should detect whether  is supported. Currently it includes a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/configure.ac#L436&gt;check&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which wrongly assumes that there is a usable ICU package installed. Maybe that check can simply be removed. In addition,  should be set with the values detected by pkg-config.

		The issue was reported before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/98747b37ea8f8a0a02b3070506752c9755f329a0&gt;98747b3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was merged.
The version of the icu package in the official CentOS repo is 50.1, which is lower than the minimum required version 52.1.

		Even with the latest version from Git the issue still exists as I noticed today. The version check fails, but the header check says that everything is fine and allows building training tools with the know build error.

		The build was done on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.5.

		The issue still seems to exist. Any solutions yet?

		What do you mean with "the issue still exist"? Is there issue with recent version of ICU (&gt;52.1)?
		</comment>
		<comment id='13' author='16seven' date='2019-01-31T23:39:37Z'>
		If icu is below 52.1, no error is thrown, when configuring. The error appears first during make-ing the training.

		<comment id='14' author='16seven' date='2019-02-01T07:59:57Z'>
		So why you asks for solution? amitdo already wrote you need to have ICU &gt;= 52.1

		<comment id='15' author='16seven' date='2019-02-01T08:16:59Z'>
		The missing requirements should be found, but is not. The missing ICU libraries should be complained during configure. The option to make training should not be displayed. Instead a warning: "Missing ICU..."
There have been some lines added to the configure check, which are not working correctly.

		But it is not solution for you problem! You will not be able to build training tool with it. Solution is to use recent ICU version. And it is already described.

 If you have trouble with ICU version you can add remi repo for CentOS 7 and install libicu62. I was having similar issue as i was not able to make training because icu &lt;=51.2 in release4.1.1


$vim /etc/yum.repos.d/remi.repo 


find enable=0 and make it as enable=1
this will enable the repo


$yum install libicu62-devel
then you can do ./configure
