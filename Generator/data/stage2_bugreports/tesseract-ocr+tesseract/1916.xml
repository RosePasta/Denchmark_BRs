	<summary>Unusable OCR result with page segmentation mode 1 (enforced by options hocr and pdf)</summary>
	<description>
While testing the accuracy of some of our OCR results from old books, I got some really bad results. One of them is
&lt;denchmark-link:https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/digi/461732149/max/461732149_0158.jpg&gt;https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/digi/461732149/max/461732149_0158.jpg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which has good readable characters, but the text lines are not horizontal. This is also true for most other bad results. The output is completely unusable: &lt;denchmark-link:https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/digi/461732149/tess/461732149_0158.hocr&gt;https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/digi/461732149/tess/461732149_0158.hocr&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/digi/461732149/tess/461732149_0158.txt&gt;https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/digi/461732149/tess/461732149_0158.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I then ran a manual test producing only txt output and was surprised that the result was good. The difference is caused by the configuration options. When I use  (my usual configuration to create hOCR, PDF and text output), the results are bad. With the default (text only), the results are much better: &lt;denchmark-link:https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/anciendroit/new/tess4-fraktur-psm3/461732149_0158.txt&gt;https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/anciendroit/new/tess4-fraktur-psm3/461732149_0158.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The options pdf and hocr enforce page segmentation mode 1. Obviously that causes unusable results in my cases. The really bad thing is that psm 1 is even used when I add --psm 3. That implies for me that we either must remove all tessedit_pageseg_mode from the option files or find a different solution.

, please mark this as a bug. I think it must be fixed for 4.0.0.
PS: I used -l script/Fraktur in my test.

) were affected by the same unexpected behavior of Tesseract. Is there a good reason for the current setting with some configurations (,  and )? Otherwise I'd simply remove the page segmentation mode from all (or at least that three) configuration files.
There is also a redundancy because the page segmentation mode can be set by --psm=n, but also by -c tessedit_pageseg_mode=n. Do we need this redundancy, or can we mark --psm as deprecated in 4.0.0 and remove it in 4.1.0? I suggest to do that to reduce code and remove complexity. The man page and help text could still include information on page segmentation modes.

		 page segmentation mode can be set by --psm=n, but also by -c
tessedit_pageseg_mode=n

Is it not possible to map the user input of  --psm=n on commandline to  -c
tessedit_pageseg_mode=n
and then have a single path of code.

The command line psm should override the one in config files. However, is
there a reason that it is =1 for pdf, hocr etc and would any processing
break if it was overwritten?

 can answer regarding pdf.

@jbreiden can answer regarding pdf.

It's not specific to pdf. hocr/tsv have the same issue.
The source of the problem is not in these renderers.
