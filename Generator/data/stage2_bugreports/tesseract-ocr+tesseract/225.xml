 has a couple of problems with it.
Most seriously the new information is inserted into the middle of the element ID, causing lots of duplicated IDs on the page and corrupted ascender height information.
The other issue is that it uses non-standard attributes which won't validate.  The hOCR spec places all its information in the title attribute and I believe it makes most sense to use that mechanism for the extended information, using the x_ prefix to avoid collisions with future extensions to the spec.
