	<summary>Issue 13593: tesseract-ocr/fuzzer-api: Undefined-shift in scaleGray2xLILineLow</summary>
	<description>
OSS Fuzz reports an issue here:
scale1.c:2717:28: runtime error: left shift of 255 by 24 places cannot be represented in type 'l_int32' (aka 'int')
See 
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/1.77.0/src/scale1.c#L2717&gt;https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/1.77.0/src/scale1.c#L2717&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DanBloomberg&gt;@DanBloomberg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this is Leptonica code, so OSS Fuzz triggers a problem via the Tesseract API.

		Looking at the code, I don't see the issue.
All the words are uint32, all the 8 bit pixel values are int32, but each is masked with 0xFF.
So the line in question is just a sum of 4 numbers, each &lt;= 255, and then divided by 4.

		Looks like it was fuzzed on 1.77.0, not the current head.  So the issue is really on line 2725.  And I do see the problem, something I'd have never thought about.
I believe the simple fix is to make all the sval* pixel values uint32.  Then when one is pushed &lt;&lt; 24, it's still valid.  Will check this out.

		That's right, it is currently &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/tesseract-ocr/build.sh#L19&gt;using 1.77.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I wonder whether &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guidovranken&gt;@guidovranken&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could add Leptonica to OSS Fuzz, too. Ah, I see that it already exists: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/leptonica&gt;https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/leptonica&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guidovranken&gt;@guidovranken&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, is it possible to add Dan and me to that configuration, so we can see the issues for Leptonica found so far?

		You can make a PR against google/oss-fuzz that adds you and Dan to  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/leptonica/project.yaml&gt;https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/leptonica/project.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I'm not in charge of the leptonica project or oss-fuzz.

		Fix is in at leptonica master.
Is there some place we should log this, or will the fuzzer eventually run on the fix and consider the issue cleared, or ...?

		The oss-fuzz system will automatically detect the fix in the next build.

		Really? It's in Leptonica, and I would have expected that an update of the configuration is needed. Maybe it can use Leptonica master instead of 1.77.0.
		</comment>
		<comment id='8' author='stweil' date='2019-03-08T20:02:08Z'>
		Right, it's using a static version now.. I'll make a PR against the tesseract-ocr oss-fuzz project to use Leptonica master.

Maybe it can use Leptonica master instead of 1.77.0.

Should tesseract also change dependency to the new/fixed version of leptonica?

		<comment id='12' author='stweil' date='2019-03-10T11:32:34Z'>
		Up to now there exists no Leptonica release with the fix (it's only in Git master).
So the question is how to get the fix into the major Linux distributions. I think this requires new Leptonica releases 1.74.5, 1.75.4, 1.76.1 and 1.77.1. Otherwise Debian and others would have to patch the code. CC &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jbreiden&gt;@jbreiden&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 : What is the  plan for 1.78.0 release?
		</comment>
		<comment id='14' author='stweil' date='2019-03-10T17:11:08Z'>
		No specific plan.  I can do it within the next three weeks.
AFAICT we do not need a release for this bug.  I haven't run the fuzzer, but I can't believe there is any memory corruption. The only thing the bug can do is make a few bad pixels in an 8 bpp grayscale image when that particular fast 2x upscaler is used.

		<comment id='15' author='stweil' date='2019-03-10T17:34:05Z'>
		You are right, it's not a security problem. Up to now OSS-Fuzz only detected one real security issue (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/2298&gt;#2298&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). But of course for OCR a few bad pixels might result in wrong text recognition, so it is good that this is fixed now.

		OSS-Fuzz has verified the fix in Leptonica, so this issue can be closed. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=13593&gt;details here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (will be visible for everyone in 30 days).

		actually I can't see it ... perhaps one needs to be on the auto_css list at
oss-fuzz/projects/tesseract-ocr  ?

but it's likely not important for me to be on it.
