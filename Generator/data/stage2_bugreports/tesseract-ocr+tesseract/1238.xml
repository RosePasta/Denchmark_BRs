	<summary>Garbage output with pdf mode and not txt</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;



Tesseract Version: 
tesseract 4.00.00alpha
leptonica-1.74.4
libjpeg 9b : libpng 1.6.34 : libtiff 4.0.9 : zlib 1.2.8
Found AVX
Found SSE


Platform:
Darwin MacBook-Pro.local 16.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jun 15 17:36:27 PDT 2017; root:xnu-3789.70.16~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64


[Also replicated on Ubuntu 14.04 with tesseract 4.00.00alpha]
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The text output is garbage when using pdf mode and perfect when using txt mode.
commands run...

$ tesseract cropped.tiff cropped txt
$ tesseract cropped.tiff cropped pdf
$ gs -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o cropped_dump.txt cropped.pdf

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/1573511/debug_files.zip&gt;debug_files.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is what the output from the txt output looks like.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It is not an issue with ghostscript pdf to text since copy-pasting text from pdf is the same. The TIFF is 300ppi and each character is about 30px high.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Text layer of pdf being somewhat similar to txt output or at least partially correct.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Suggested Fix:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

None
Any help is greatly appreciated.

		Text extraction on Chrome also shows similar garbage. Using qpdf --stream-data=uncompress the first few lines of embedded text looks like this. Thus the first three characters should be ascii 4E 4E 49 which do not look very promising to me ('O' 'N' 'I'). Not sure what is going on.

		Problem reproduces with the copy of Tesseract I have in hand, which is not currently synchronized with git. So whatever is going on, it is not brand new. One strong hint is the coordinate system for the Tm operator, which starts with -1 0 0 -1. That's not typical and makes me think we're recognizing upside down or something crazy like that.

		Found it. The configuration for PDF creation contains an additional directive, which sets page segmentation mode to 1. When this is set, Tesseract gets confused by this image and tries to recognize it upside down. Removing that directive makes text and pdf recognition match. That is your workaround. I do not recall what page_seg_mode 1 does, nor why we have it default to on for PDF and off for text.
config/txt
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tessedit_create_txt 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

config/pdf
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tessedit_create_pdf 1
tessedit_pageseg_mode 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Here's the relevant help for page segmentation mode.
1    Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
3    Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
Folks are welcome to play around with the two settings and see if there is a scenario where it makes a (helpful) difference. My guess is I blindly followed the example from HOCR when I wrote the config.

		I'm going to mark fixed because this is understood. I consider it an open question is we want to make any changes to configs, but probably not bug-worthy.

		Hi jbreiden,
Thank you!! An equally fast and helpful reply. That fixed the problem completely. For anyone else who finds this, you need to pass this config file as an option...

tessedit_create_pdf 1
tessedit_pageseg_mode 3
