	<summary>OS X Yosemite with OpenCL: --enable-opencl now compiles but OCR fails</summary>
	<description>
It seems that any OpenCL operation on my OS X Yosemite machine triggers attempts to allocate extremely large memory blocks and allocation failures.
The size of the attempted allocation is 1125865547108352 bytes or in hex, 0x3fff800001000, which looks special.
OpenCL otherwise works on my machine. I use the Python OpenCV library and a commercial application that uses OpenCL.
Aside from whatever is happening here, it also looks like a bug that the profile data gets written even if OpenCL fails. I highly doubt my graphics card and processor give identical performance so it looks some invalid calculation takes place and the results are then saved.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Testing --list-langs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Checking for languages in an OpenCL binary:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;set -x TESSDATA_PREFIX /usr/local/Cellar/tesseract/3.03rc1_3/share   # Homebrew tesseract 3.03

		My stab in the dark at any answer is that, for some reason, the OpenCL API or ABI different from Tesseract is expecting as declared in header files.
The malloc error occurs because (openclwrapper.cpp:674) in
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;size_t numDevices;
clGetProgramInfo(... sizeof(numDevices), &amp;numDevices, ...):
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The call to clGetProgramInfo writes the correct value to the lower 32-bit of numDevices, but leaves uninit'ed garbage in the upper 32-bits. But even if this is correct, other OpenCL calls generated errors:

I'd be happy to investigate further if someone can point me in the right direction.

 I got the same error as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ryanfb&gt;@ryanfb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The consensus is that AC_CHECK_LIB doesn't play nicely with . Instead you can introduce a new macro, or just bypass the check on OS X. The nice thing about frameworks is that they are internally consistent, where you never what kind of crazy library-header mismatches you might find on a *nix box.

 I disabled the AC_CHECK_LIB(OpenCL) and replaced it with . That got me to a new error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;configure: error: conditional "OPENMP" was never defined.
Usually this means the macro was only invoked conditionally.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To repair that I added the required conditional:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;@@ -168,12 +168,14 @@ if test "$enable_embedded" = "yes"; then

 # check whether to build OpenMP support

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After autoreconf -fvi I had a working ./configure.
...and make failed with several errors of this form:

		The line if test $host_os != Darwin; then does not work because $host_os is darwin14.5.0. If this test is bypassed, configure works and make fails with a new error.

That error occurs even though I am running env LIBLEPT_HEADERSDIR=/usr/local/include/leptonica ./configure --enable-opencl, the location of allheaders.h. Using CC=gcc-5 (homebrew gcc, not clang) also gives the header error.
Here is clang.

 is also required. So I got to compile and apparently run successful OpenCL tests in which it selected my graphics card... but the OCR output was garbage. For example, if I had it generate a PDF, it still produced a valid PDF containing the input image, but the OCR text and its positioning was meaningless.
If I rebuild the same source with OpenCL my test file was processed correctly.

 Our patches to date have fixed the build, but tesseract with OpenCL on Mac outputs gibberish as the OCR results (on an image that passes normal OCR). Both the perceived position of text and output text are corrupted. However, a blank image is correctly interpreted as a being blank - for example, tesseract can properly render a blank PDF file. I take this to mean somewhere OpenCL is distorting or corrupting the input during processing.
How I can test it to narrow down where the error actually occurs?

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In both cases, I did output to PDF, and the PDF is formatted correct. The OCR is nonsense. When output to plain text, the OCR is also nonsense.
If Tesseract is built without OpenCL the same image works fine for OCR.

		I tried both master and 3.04.00 with --enable-opencl on Ubuntu with Catalyst 15.7 and for my two devices (FX8120 and R9 285) the OCR also outputs a .txt but the content is only empty lines and some wrong characters. Forcing to run without opencl achieves the correct output.
When running with OpenCL on FX8120 there are no warnings or errors during execution, but there are some warnings as tiff page not found and box outside rectangle on R9 285. In the end, the (wrong) output is the same for any of them.

		With OpenCL-enabled HEAD on OS X, I also get garbage for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jbarlow83&gt;@jbarlow83&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's test image.
However if I convert PDFs to TIFF in the way I usually do for OCR with Tesseract, I can get text with OpenCL-enabled HEAD (the BW PDF for &lt;denchmark-link:https://archive.org/details/aesopsfables00mclo&gt;this book&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in this example):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;convert -density 300 aesopsfables00mclo_bw.pdf -type Grayscale -compress lzw -background white +matte -depth 32 page_%05d.tif
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then OCR with e.g. for i in page_*.tif; do tesseract $i $(basename $i .tif); done works fine and produces text (in both text and PDF output modes). This also seems to work for multipage TIFFs (just convert without the %05d in the output filename), however, if I try to process a multipage TIFF during the initial OpenCL profiling run, Tesseract always crashes with a SIGABRT after the first page.
Another thing I notice though is that I also get a score of inf for my CPU on OpenCL, is this a bug that needs to be fixed in the HistogramRect/ThresholdRectToPix evaluations?

		I tried tesseract -c tessedit_write_images=1 ... and got the following result. The image has the same dimensions as the input image and there is a visual correspondence of sorts between the images, but it's very mangled. First image is input, second is "tessinput.tif" after Tesseract's mangling.

: If a read and write pointer were strobing the data by different amounts you'd get this sort of thing. This really looks it a single increment somewhere is the wrong size and should be an easy fix for someone who knew where to look in the code base (i.e. not me).

		Yep, I have the same problem. Try resizing your image to powers of 2. Actually, just resize the canvas, leave the text part unchanged.You could do it with ImageMagick convert, or any image editor like Photoshop. Probably you only need to size the width to power of 2, I didn't test that, but it looks like the pitch is being miscalculated with non-power of two sized images.

		Oh...didn't mention it, but I get exactly the same output as you. Bring the distorted image up in PhotoShop, Select Filter-&gt;Distort-&gt;Shear and shear top left to bottom right with Wraparound selected. Do that 2-4 times and the text will magically appear.

		Hi folks,
i have a similar problems with the garbage output, when i enable opencl. I have checked out the current master revision (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/bd45b3ae4fd2ff54a60077e7190c887ccbe5e5c7&gt;bd45b3a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). also i get the mangled image with  command too.
The OS is Debian 64bit.
My Settings are:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tesseract 4.00.00alpha
 leptonica-1.74.1
  libjpeg 6b (libjpeg-turbo 1.3.1) : libpng 1.2.50 : libtiff 4.0.3 : zlib 1.2.8

 OpenCL info:
  Found 1 platform(s).
  Platform 1 name: NVIDIA CUDA.
  Version: OpenCL 1.1 CUDA 6.5.51.
  Found 1 device(s).
    Device 1 name: GeForce GTX 750 Ti.
 Found AVX
 Found SSE

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the console output is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
OSD: Weak margin (1.36) for 292 blob text block, but using orientation anyway: 0
[DS] Profile read from file (tesseract_opencl_profile_devices.dat).
[DS] Device[1] 1:GeForce GTX 750 Ti score is 0.128314
[DS] Device[2] 0:(null) score is 0.917442
[DS] Selected Device[1]: "GeForce GTX 750 Ti" (OpenCL)
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with Leptonica
OSD: Weak margin (5.65) for 486 blob text block, but using orientation anyway: 3
Error in boxClipToRectangle: box outside rectangle
Error in pixScanForForeground: invalid box
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My Question is: do i have a malconfigurated system or is it a bug?
