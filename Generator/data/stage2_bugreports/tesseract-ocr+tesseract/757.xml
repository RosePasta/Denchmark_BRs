		The training machine has 23 GiB RAM plus 23 GiB swap, and about 35 GiB of that memory are available for the training. Maybe some Debian GNU Linux defaults set a smaller limit for single processes, but I don't think we have a memory problem.

 12 fonts is not enough for LSTM. Use as much fonts as you can find.

​&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stweil&gt;@stweil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 You can increase the number of box/tiff pairs by adding
--exposures "-1 0 1" or even --exposures "-2 -1 0 1 2" ​with the same fonts
to get images which are lighter and darker than the original font.

```
training/tesstrain.sh --fonts_dir /usr/share/fonts --lang frk  \
  --linedata_only --noextract_font_properties --exposures "-1 0 1" \
   --langdata_dir ../langdata --tessdata_dir ./tessdata \
     --output_dir ~/tesstutorial/frk
```

Also, please check whether the fonts you are using have support for the
paragraph marker etc, otherwise they might get dropped as unrenderable.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/theraysmith&gt;@theraysmith&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I think it will be useful if training using non-synthetic
box/tiff pairs is also supported for LSTM.

Thanks.

 I had  generated box files for different Fraktur font alphabet images using makebox. However these need to be reviewed for correctness and tabs need to be added at end of lines.
I do not recognize the letters so can't update them. jtessboxeditor could be used for adding tabs.

, that's a nice collection of Fraktur fonts, but several of the image not even include all normal ASCII characters. All images are missing the long s character (ſ) which is very important for all Fraktur texts. Also missing are all forms of ligatures (combinations of certain characters, like for example ffi, which need a special rendering).

		I know. I do not have those fonts,but found these images on the net on some
font sites. If you or Ray have the resources to get these fonts, you can
use them to create appropriate trainingdata.

 The page about fonts will be very useful. I have added info about Devanagari fonts and will update more later.
Please see pages 2-9 in &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/genzmer.pdf&gt;http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/genzmer.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

mya.sh: line 232: 15076 Trace/breakpoint trap   (core dumped) lstmtraining --model_output $trained_output_dir/layer --continue_from $bestdata_dir/$BaseLang.lstm --append_index 5 --net_spec '[Lfx192 O1c1]' --traineddata $layer_output_dir/$Lang/$Lang.traineddata --max_iterations $LayerIterations --debug_interval $DebugInterval --eval_listfile $eval_output_dir/$Lang.training_files.txt --train_listfile $layer_output_dir/$Lang.training_files.txt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When an --eval_listfile is given with lstmtraining command, eval is also run in parallel (in sequential training mode).
I think that when lstmtraining is terminated on reaching max_iterations the eval process is not being brought to a graceful close. That seems to be the cause of this assertion.

		It looks like the issues &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1168&gt;#1168&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/2191&gt;#2191&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are related. They all could be caused by missing thread synchronisation from this code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;src/ccstruct/imagedata.cpp:  SVSync::StartThread(ReCachePagesFunc, this);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		IMO this should be "reworked". I already wander why (lstm) training (which is non interactive) try to start server... (e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/578&gt;#578&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1168&gt;#1168&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) =&gt; target should be that lstmtraining must work with --disable-graphics option.

		As part of training tutorial/instructions Ray has given the command to include  (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#training-from-scratch&gt;https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract-4.00#training-from-scratch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)



debug_interval
int
0
If non-zero (and positive) , show visual debugging every this many iterations.



If the values of -1 or 0 (default) are used then visual debugger is not called.

		thanks shree. Did you try to use --debug_interval  with build option --disable-graphics?

		<comment id='36' author='stweil' date='2019-07-11T16:10:01Z'>
		I usually build with  --disable-graphics and use --debug_interval of 0 and -1 while running lstmtraining.
I have not tried lstmtraining with a non-zero positive number for --debug_interval.

		The problem still exists. I just got it while running training with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd-train&gt;ocrd-train&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It looks like the issues #1168 and #2191 are related. They all could be caused by missing thread synchronisation.

All those problems will be triggered when the destructor DocumentData::~DocumentData() destroys the object while there is still another thread at the beginning of DocumentData::ReCachePages(). That thread will still work with the destroyed object and fail of course.
I can reproduce a SIGSEGV caused by this by running imagedata_test several times on some hosts:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd unittest;
while ./imagedata_test; do true; done
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

On other hosts that test does not trigger the problem. Maybe those hosts are too fast.

		Pull request &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/3016&gt;#3016&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 hopefully fixes this.
