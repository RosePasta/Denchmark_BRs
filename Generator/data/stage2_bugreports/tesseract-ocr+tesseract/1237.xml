	<summary>Tesseract contains_unichar_id error</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I have image files that fail with the following error:

contains_unichar_id(unichar_id):Error:Assert failed:in file ../ccutil/unicharset.h, line 513                                                                                                      Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I am running it with

-l deu -c preserve_interword_spaces=1 -psm 3

I know that similar questions have been asked, but I have not seen an applicable solution yet.
I tried different languages, which did not help.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Tesseract Version: v4.00.00alpha
Platform: Ubuntu 64bit
