	<summary>crash with --psm 0 and -l eng or -l deu</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
the current master branch crashes on the attached file and some others and shows signifcant wrong results for confidence and script in comparion to 2017 alpha version.
sample files and minimalist test show the problem

test with current master source :

Problems : confidence is reported 0.01 / scipt is reported japanese

--psm 0 and -l eng or -l deu crashes for this image and some others
tests with other --psm values for reference only

comparison to 2017 alpha version

Result with 2017 alpha :
very high confidence
correct orientation detection
no crash

		Did you use different eng.traineddata for the tests with old and new version?

		My installation steps are as follows :
for 4.00 master tests :
I use precompiled installer/binary from
https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v4.0.0-rc1.20181002.exe
which downloads and installs its own language data.
After installer is finished, I replace tesseract.exe, tesseract.dll and about 20+ dlls from a local build because the -c min_characters_to_try is not incorportated in the 20181002 build
for 4.00 alpha tests :
I use precompiled installer/binary from
https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-4.0.0-20170804.exe
which downloads and installs its own language data
After installer is finished, I replace tesseract.exe, tesseract.dll and about 20+ dlls from a local build because the I have modified the hardcoded constant -kMinCharacters in file osdetect.cpp from 50, down to 10 which is critical
I have not manually added or replaced any eng.traineddata files.
If the installer is not pulling the right versions of those traineddata files, I would need to know where those correct versions are to be downloaded from.

		the issue seems to have something to do with the traineddata files
steps :
install tesseract-ocr-setup-4.0.0-20170804.exe
replace exe and all dll's from self compiled master
result does not crash anymore, gives some result, but still not as good as 20170804
rotation detection is correct
script type is correct
confidence is far lower (0.16 in master versus 1.26 in 20170804 ) - I use a confidence threshold between 0.4 and 0.5  to determine if the result is reliable enough or to continue spot checking. Therefore the accuracy of the reported confidence is an important value. It is too low now

		problem solved.
when this .traineddata is used, there is no crash in current master and results are identical to 20170804
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/blob/master/eng.traineddata
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/blob/master/deu.traineddata
the installers of the 2018 precompiled versions seem to use incompatible traineddata files that the engine does not expect which I was not aware of
Also maybe worth noting;
"Fast" versions of all tessdata files crash with current master and --psm 0 -l (lang)

		The crash with LSTM models is addressed in pull request &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/1964&gt;#1964&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
