	<summary>fopenReadSteam and findFileFormat error saying file not found.</summary>
	<description>
I have read through some other people reporting such an issue. Not sure what's the solution but the error looks something like this. I guess the issue is from Leptonica? How do i fix it? The file is clearly there in the same directory. ( C:\Users\Mann\eng.sample_font.exp0.tif)
PS C:\Users\Mann&gt; tesseract eng.sample_font.exp0.tif eng.sample_font.exp0 batch.nochop makebox
Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine vv4.0.0-beta.4.20180912 with Leptonica
Error in fopenReadStream: file not found
Error in findFileFormat: image file not found
Error during processing.
.tif files are accepted right? Also what's a good GUI tool for tesseract? I just installed gImageReader.

		Does tesseract eng.sample_font.exp0.tif eng.sample_font.exp0 work? If it works: can you load eng.sample_font.exp0.tif in an image viewer? Is it really a correct TIFF file?

, according to the above output it's a rather new version (v4.0.0-beta.4.20180912 which is basically v4.0.0-beta.4) of our Windows installer.

It's a TFF file I downloaded from this site.

I will try loading the TFF in a viewer. Any recommended image viewer? The generated file from the command is 0kB.

		TFF != TIFF
Tesseract does not support font files like ttf as input. It does not make sense.
