		I noticed that, too, but cannot reproduce it.

		Remove the tmp files (documentdata*.lstmf) and then run it again.  Sometimes that reproduces the error.

		Could the error be caused by running more than one imagedata_test at the same time? This is a general problem, because each instance will create and use the same files, so this scenario won't work. To fix this, each test program would have to create a private directory for temporary files and remove that directory when it terminates.

		I did not intentionally run more than one imagedata_test at the same time. However, I did try a couple of runs with --disable-openmp.
Is it possible that googletest runs multiple instances of tests?

		It won't parallelize tests by itself, but of course you can have multiple tests running at the same time by other means (background jobs, make -j, ...).

		No, it isn't. I got it yesterday:

		Here is a stack trace of the crash:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(gdb) i s

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

A second thread shows that the test is already finished.  is indeed run in a separate thread, and obviously it depends on the order how main thread and that new thread are running whether the code crashes or not. So this looks like a general problem, and issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues/1168&gt;#1168&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is related with a high probability.

		This is still open and happens randomly with git master.
