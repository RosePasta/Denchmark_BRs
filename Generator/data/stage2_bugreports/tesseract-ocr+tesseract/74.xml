	<summary>Compile time option NO_CUBE_BUILD disables some features which are not actually related to cube engine in file api/baseapi.cpp</summary>
	<description>
Look for these functions:

ProcessPagesMultipageTiff(...)
ProcessPagesInternal(...)
ProcessPage(...)

I think NO_CUBE_BUILD in these functions should be changed to SOMETHING_ELSE, probably back to ANDROID_BUILD.
Ray might not want these features on Android, but I see no reason to disable them in a desktop/server environment.
