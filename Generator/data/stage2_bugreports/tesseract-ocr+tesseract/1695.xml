&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tesseract 4.0.0-beta.1-370-g8b64
 leptonica-1.76.0
  libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.4.2) : libpng 1.2.54 : libtiff 4.0.6 : zlib 1.2.8
 Found AVX2
 Found AVX
 Found SSE
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Platform: Linux ubuntu 4.4.0-116-generic #140-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 12 21:23:04 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I would like to recognize the below image correctly. I am using the last eng.traineddata that failed to detect the difference between Z and 2
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25582838/41740389-28d5caee-7598-11e8-9d06-e9802c4f6ae1.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have tried the following configuration --psm 6 --oem 0,1,2
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The letter to be recognized correctly
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Suggested Fix:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

retrain eng.traineddata on the miss-recognized letters

		Hi, I'm &lt;denchmark-link:https://gitmate.io&gt;GitMate.io&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
!
It seems you've just enabled the issue triaging. I'm just scraping all issues from your repository and will give you some more information about this in a few minutes or so.
Because of the rate limit we can't scrape all information (including all comments and authors) right now - our system is already set up to scrape this in the next days over which the predictions will become more precise every day.
If you want me to use a different account for triaging your issues, simply create one and log in with it.
Sit tight!

		About this GitMate...
Nice idea, but seems to produce a lot of noise.

I use this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/master/eng.traineddata&gt;https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/raw/master/eng.traineddata&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

also this is the output &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/files/2127888/out.txt&gt;out.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and command used

 here are the results:

My guess is that, the file that you were using is actually based on the tessdata_best, but was converted and integerized to a fast model, bywhich it's size was reduced and it's recognition rate.
For your situation, you can use tessdata_fast &amp; Latin.traineddata from the best scripts (links are provided).
Also you can finetune the tessdata_best if you wish.
Ps: This warning message means that your image does not contain a resolution info in its metadata, so Tesseract warns you about this issue in the image and try to estimate the resolution by itself.
