	<summary>Possible memory leak when building training files</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Tesseract Version: 4.0-rc3, 4.0-rc2, 4.0-rc1
Platform: Linux 9000119697 4.15.0-36-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 24 16:19:09 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Cut training text into smaller chunks (~20000 lines each, ~1.3mb) to build training files on smaller computers in parallel.
Tried building frk training files using:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;src/training/tesstrain.sh \
--lang frk \
--linedata_only \
--noextract_font_properties \
--fonts_dir ~/frk_fonts/ \
--langdata_dir ~/langdata_lstm/ \
--tessdata_dir ~/tessdata/ \
--output_dir ~/tessOutput/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Memory usage increases rapidly (total &gt;15gb when process was killed by kernel)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

With same training text until 4.0-beta.4 memory usage increased at a much lower rate (max usage &lt;4gb)

		I'm also just about to report the same issue and have funished bisecting.
Maybe related to this commit.

		Well, what I mentioned above is text2image issue.
Now following command consumes more than 1GB of memory.
text2image.exe --fonts_dir /c/Windows/Fonts --font Meiryo --text langdata/jpn/jpn.training_text --max_pages 0 --outputbase test
It used to consume about 100MB before.
tesstrain.sh runs 8 tasks simultanously so if each task consumes 1GB RAM it crashes computer with 8GB RAM.
If you say lstmtraining leaks memory, it is a different problem.

		Sorry about mixing up issues.
OP's issue with tesstrain.sh is related to text2image since lstmtraining is run separately after that. I am deleting my earlier comment since it is a different issue.

		tesstrain.sh continues even if text2image crashed.
After that lstmtraining generates error message because text2image died without generating box files.

		This looks like a bug and a regression if beta.4 still was fine. So we have to decide whether fixing it is required for 4.0.0.

		It depends on how quickly you can find the faulty commit...

		A number of people use training, specially for finetuning of non-Latin languages which have been trained at Google with fewer fonts.
While there are many issues with training that are on hold right now, I think this regression should be fixed before 4.0.0.

 : you are right. Problem is that if PangoFontMap is created with pango_cairo_font_map_get_default() it &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/pango-Cairo-Rendering.html#pango-cairo-font-map-get-default&gt;must not be freed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , but if it is created with pango_cairo_font_map_new_for_font_type, &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/pango-Cairo-Rendering.html#pango-cairo-font-map-new-for-font-type&gt;it should be freed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Memory resumption is looking good again (text2image 4.0.0-rc3-41-g0a42c0).
However I do not get any text rendered into the images (just blank pages), whereas this worked in the same setup with 4.0.0-beta.4. I will look into this and open up a separate issue for it.
