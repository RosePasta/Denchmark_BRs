	<summary>Branch "4.0" provides 5.0.0-alpha</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Tesseract Version: 4.0
Platform: Linux XXX 4.4.0-151-generic #178-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 11 08:30:22 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When checking out Git branch "4.0" I get 5.0.0-alpha. The compiled binary tries to find libtesseract.so.5, which can not be found. Also I build Debian packages from compiled source using checkinstall. Checkinstall says it's version 5.0.0-alpha-29-gc6985.
(Tag "4.0.0" gets version 4 correctly but it misses ALTO support and I need it. Version 4.1 randomly crashes, thus I want to try the hopefully more stable 4.0)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I should get version 4.0 and it should use and find libtesseract.so.4.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Suggested Fix:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

?

		Branch 4.0 is unsupported and was superseded by branch 4.1. I suggest to use that one.
The main reason is that the 4.0 branch includes API changes which are incompatible with release 4.0.0, so it is a broken branch. The 4.1 branch fixed that and adds important new features (ALTO support) and bug fixes.

		Thanks. I should create a new issue focusing the crashes than. At the moment I'm testing a version in between: the last commit by you related to ALTO support from December. If it doesn't crash, the cause is in the following commits.
