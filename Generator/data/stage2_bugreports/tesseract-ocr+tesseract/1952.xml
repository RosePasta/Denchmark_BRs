	<summary>PdfRenderer inverts monochrome TIFF image + one more</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Tesseract Version: Built form the main branch on 10/2/2018
Commit Number: Exists in the current version as of 10/5/2018
Platform: 32-bit Windows 10

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behavior:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Monochrome images are displayed inverted in generated PDF files.
Extra instructions in PDF page content stream when text_only flag is used (minor).

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Suggested Fix:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Code lines from pdfrenderer.cpp starting at line number 718:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  int format, sad;
  sad = pixGenerateCIData(pix, L_FLATE_ENCODE, 0, 0, &amp;cid);
  if (!cid) {
    sad = l_generateCIDataForPdf(filename, pix, kJpegQuality, &amp;cid);
  }

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We are trying Flate encoder first. This encoder can handle 1bpp images, so it succeeds and is used to insert the image into the PDF file as in the following extract:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;11 0 obj
&lt;&lt;
  /Length 31159
  /Subtype /Image
  /ColorSpace /DeviceGray
  /Width 1728
  /Height 2376
  /BitsPerComponent 1
  /Filter /FlateDecode
  /DecodeParms
  &lt;&lt;
    /Predictor 1
    /Colors 1
    /Columns 1728
    /BitsPerComponent 1
  &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
stream
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The original image was a CCITT G4 compressed TIFF image. We shouldn't use PNG compression as it is not as efficient and has a different default for black (ie BlackIs1).

When generating a text_only PDF, the following code starting at line 347 is executed:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  pdf_str += "q ";
  pdf_str.add_str_double("", prec(width));
  pdf_str += " 0 0 ";
  pdf_str.add_str_double("", prec(height));
  pdf_str += " 0 0 cm";
  if (!textonly_) {
    pdf_str += " /Im1 Do";
  }
  pdf_str += " Q\n";


&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This correctly excludes the image from page content, but also generates a few lines that are not needed. I would propose to exclude the whole block as in:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if (!textonly_) {
  pdf_str += "q ";
  pdf_str.add_str_double("", prec(width));
  pdf_str += " 0 0 ";
  pdf_str.add_str_double("", prec(height));
  pdf_str += " 0 0 cm";
  pdf_str += " /Im1 Do";
  pdf_str += " Q\n";
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Both issues are in the below screenshot:

, are you sure that the reported issue can be reproduced when text_only flag was true? I found the text in generated PDF was invisible when text_only flag is true. The generated pdf is blank. It's different with your reporting however it should be a bug. When text_only flag is false, I reproduced the reported issue. I verified that this issue was fixed by commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/f794571195b089b8ae9c047d36ce77b7b27712ab&gt;f794571&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

, The OCR text is always invisible. Tesseract uses a single glyph
font with rendering attribute of 3 for text that is hidden behind the
original image. The text_only flag is expected to create a blank PDF page.

The commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/f794571195b089b8ae9c047d36ce77b7b27712ab&gt;f794571&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

does
resolve the inverted image bug as it limits the code to PNG images only. I
am OK with closing this issue.

		There is something wrong when text_only flag is true. The text rendering mode is set to 3(invisible mode) at line 363:
362  if (res_it-&gt;IsAtBeginningOf(RIL_BLOCK)) {
363      pdf_str += "BT\n3 Tr";     // Begin text object, use invisible ink
364      old_fontsize = 0;          // Every block will declare its fontsize
365      new_block = true;          // Every block will declare its affine matrix
366    }
If text_only flag is false, the invisible text is we want because a background image will be inserted to PDF. The image will be rendered and the text can be viewed even the text rendering mode is 3 ('3 Tr' means invisible text rendering mode).
However, it introduces a trouble because there isn't a background image when text_only flag is true. No text will be rendered so the generated pdf is like a blank pdf.

, If the OCR text is always invisible, I think that we should always insert a background image into PDF (we call it as searchable pdf). That means we should remove the text_only flag. In my understanding, the text_only flag means there is no background image.

 my understanding of the text_only mode is that the process of
inserting the original image into a final PDF is left to the user.

The term text_only is probably a bit misleading as it might imply visible
text. Maybe it could be hidden_text_only or no_image. In any case, we do
expect to create a blank PDF page when text_only flag is true.

I will test and close the issue. Thanks.

 that uses Flate only for png.

		I may need to start locking this stuff down with unit tests. I sue hope we aren't transcoding PNG.
