When running:
self._planner.get_next_command(measurements.location, 
     measurements.self.end_point.location, self.end_point.orientation)
I get an error that says: (with the function that it pulls from)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; File "/path/to/carla/planner/converter.py", line 161, in _check_input_type
    if len(input_data) &gt; 2:
TypeError: object of type 'Vector3D' has no len()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Has anyone seen this problem before? I double checked that each of the four arguments I am passing in are all of type: &lt;class 'carla_server_pb2.Vector3D'&gt;, which seems to the types of both the locations and orientations?
