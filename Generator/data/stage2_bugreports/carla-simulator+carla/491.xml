	<summary>No collision info in the 0.8.3 version</summary>
	<description>
Hi, it is so exciting to see a new version of Carla! I just downloaded it and tested on my machine, it runs much faster!
However, I found that there is no collision info on HUD when I run Carla alone. It always shows 0 even if I hit other vehicles or pedestrians. Then I tried with a carla server and client_example.py, and there is no collision info on HUD and in the terminal either.
Version: Carla 0.8.3 on Ubuntu 16.04

-- Update--
It might be related to the vehicle. When I change the setting to another vehicle rather than the default Mustang, the collision info in shown on the HUD.

		Thanks for the report!
I can confirm, the new Mustang model does not have hit events enabled.
This can be fixed by setting "Simulation Generates Hit Events" in the base boxes of the physics asset to true.
Other vehicles are missing this too

Nissan Micra
All the bikes and motorbikes
Audi A2, has two physics assets (why?) one of them wrong
