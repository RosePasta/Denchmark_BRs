	<summary>IMU sensor got NaN</summary>
	<description>
Very occasionally, the IMU sensor gets nan for compass value. Is this expected or some bug? I thought it might be caused by bad orientation of the sensor (facing upward). But at the time as getting nan, it  seems normal:
pitch:0.032498039305210114
roll:1.3824284076690674
yaw:90.67381286621094
I am using carla 0.9.9 on ubuntu 18.04.

 I'm not able to reproduce this, can you provide more information? Are you working on sync / async? Cold you provide the script that you are using to get this unexpected behavior?
