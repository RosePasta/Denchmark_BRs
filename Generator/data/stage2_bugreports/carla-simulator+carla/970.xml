	<summary>rider is labeled as None</summary>
	<description>
Hello, I got image segmentation label issue in Carla.
I am using Ubuntu 16 and  version 0.9.0. I got the image segmentation for rider as None, while i think rider belongs to person.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Kevin199Q&gt;@Kevin199Q&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

That's right, our bikeriders loose their label when spawned on the vehicle. We'll fix this issue as soon as possible.

		Hi, I am having the same problem in 0.9.5. Did you come up with a quick hack or a workaround to temporarily fix this behavior?
