	<description>
In an exciting situation, as you can see in the following picture, the next motorbike climbed up the mountain, and suddenly with high speed, it comes to my agent's face.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mvpcom&gt;@mvpcom&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We've known about issues with 2 wheeled vehicles for a while &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/496&gt;#496&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , the thing is that they go off the way and lose the information the road gives to the vehicle. Once our vehicles loose this information they accelerate and steer to the right in hopes of finding the road again, sometimes crashing into something before finding it. While we fix this kind of issues we've implemented a way to deactivate them if you need it &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/497&gt;#497&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
