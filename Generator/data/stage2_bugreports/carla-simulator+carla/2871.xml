Hi for 0.9.9.1-RSS-ready compiled patch release i'm facing the libproj.so.9 import error with all the PythonAPI's
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./config.py", line 28, in &lt;module&gt;
    import carla
  File "../carla/dist/carla-0.9.9-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/carla/__init__.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "../carla/dist/carla-0.9.9-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/carla/libcarla.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "../carla/dist/carla-0.9.9-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/carla/libcarla.py", line 6, in __bootstrap__
ImportError: libproj.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hmm, I would guess the issue is not related to the delta within 0.9.9 vs 0.9.9.1, but rather due to the fact that you now want to use the RSS variant.
The egg was built using ubuntu 16.04.
If you have Ubuntu 16.04 you can solve the issue easily by installation of &lt;denchmark-link:https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/libproj9&gt;https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/libproj9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If you use Ubuntu 18.04 the problem is that there another version of the library is provided: &lt;denchmark-link:https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libproj12&gt;https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libproj12&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

So you'll have to build CARLA with RSS support on your own for now, I fear.
So I'll try to solve the issue by linking the library statically to come to a real solution to this issue, but this will take some time.
