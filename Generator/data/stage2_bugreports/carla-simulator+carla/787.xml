	<summary>UE4 Error after closing client and server carla 0.9 windows</summary>
	<description>
It isn't a big error, but i thought maybe it can help the dev team.
I built carla 0.9 on windows, following the instruction "how to build on windows".
I can start the server and also the Python example "manual_control".
When I first close the Python Client and after that the Carla Server, following Error occur.

		Thanks for the report! unfortunately there is no much info in that crash, we'll try to reproduce it here, it may be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/767&gt;#767&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 too.
