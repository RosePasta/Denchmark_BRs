	<summary>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range' when calling blueprint_library</summary>
	<description>
I am running tutorial.py and the for loop at the end, which spawns 10 cars, causes the blueprint_library to sometimes throw the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  _Map_base::at
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

it doesn't happen every time which is strange.
There are some warnings at the start which may be relevant:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING: Version mismatch detected: You are trying to connect to a simulator that might be incompatible with this API 
WARNING: Client API version     = 0.9.10.1-30-g31fff28b 
WARNING: Simulator API version  = 0.9.10.1-30-g31fff28b-dirty
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I saw another issue with a similar problem but it was with the traffic manager.
Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
I followed the guide last week to build carla, so it should be the latest version.
Also, is there a way to catch this error in python so that the finally clause runs to clean everything up?
