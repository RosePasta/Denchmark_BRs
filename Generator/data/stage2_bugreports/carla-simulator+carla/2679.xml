	<summary>"get_random_location_from_navigation()" method returns None in custom map.</summary>
	<description>
I have been working on this new map that I made from scratch with RoadRunner and Unreal Engine 4. Everything seemed pretty much fine but the problem came when I tried to spawn some walkers with spawn_npc.py. It seems like the "get_random_location_from_navigation()" doesn't recognize that I already have the .bin file with the map name on the Nav folder or something.
I made the entire process with Recast&amp;Detour libraries and built the .bin file for my sidewalks, just like the Map creation maps shows, but when I try the spawn code it doesn't spawn any walkers, and looking at the output of the code I see that "get_random_location_from_navigation()" always returns None. Anyone has any idea of what can I be missing?
I'm on Carla 0.9.8 and Ubuntu 18.04.

		Be sure to use our RecastBuilder to get the .bin, because we are using a modified version of Recast&amp;Detour that identifies sidewalks by nomenclature (Road_Sidewalk). The pedestrians only can be spawn on a sidewalk, so if the .bin has no sidewalk zones identified you can not spawn pedestrians.
