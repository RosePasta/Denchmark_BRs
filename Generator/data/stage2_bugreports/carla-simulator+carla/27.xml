		It is due to python version. Refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13998492/iteritems-in-python&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13998492/iteritems-in-python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yes, all the client files have a #!/usr/bin/env python3 at the top, this forces the execution to Python 3. An easy fix is changing this to Python 2, but it is probably better to fix the issues and keep Python 3 support.

 Yes, let's definitely have both python2 and python3 support. I had this issue before, isn't it solved just by replacing iteritems with items?
