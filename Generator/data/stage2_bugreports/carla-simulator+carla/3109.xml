	<summary>RuntimeError: Resource temporarily unavailable after start and end of ~350 clients</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I encountered "RuntimeError: Resource temporarily unavailable" for the line initializing a new client client = carla.Client('localhost', 2000) after I start, run simulation, and end ~350 clients sequentially on the same carla server.
I noticed that the opened files by the carla server process will always increase by 2 after each start and end of one client. Meanwhile, TCP connection will increase by 1 each time. Thus, these numbers keep going up as I run more client sessions.
It seems that they are not used after the end of corresponding clients but are not destroyed properly. Is there a way to manually release these resources? Is it possible to run more client sessions (&gt;350) sequentially on the same server?
Thanks!
