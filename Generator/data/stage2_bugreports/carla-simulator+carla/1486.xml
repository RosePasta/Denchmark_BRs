	<summary>Lane type info issue</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I am trying to access the lane_type info for the lane which is on right hand side of the
ego_vehicle.
And I am getting following results:

current lane is driving
first right lane is parking
second right lane is sidewalk

But if we look at below image there is no parking lane. Is this expected?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    _current_lane_info = self.ego_vehicle.get_world().get_map().get_waypoint(self.ego_vehicle.get_location())
    print(_current_lane_info.lane_type)
    if(str(_current_lane_info.lane_type) == 'Driving'):
        _new_lane = _current_lane_info.get_right_lane()
        while(True):
            print(self._num_lane_changes, _new_lane.lane_type)
            if((str(_new_lane.lane_type) == 'Driving') or (str(_new_lane.lane_type) == 'Parking')):
                _new_lane = _new_lane.get_right_lane()
                self._num_lane_changes += 1
            else:
                break
    else:
        _new_lane = _current_lane_info
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 ,
I think there is some issue for maps on 0.9.4? No matter where the vehicle is, the lane type attached to its waypoint is always "driving". I checked the opendrive .xodr file, I think the lane type definition inside is right. So I believe there is something wrong with the lane id annotation for the carla map.
