	<summary>Carla 0.9.9 crashes with Segmentation Fault error due to the new Opendrive tool.</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I'm trying out the Opendrive standalone tool on Carla 0.9.9. Compiled version. (using NVIDIA 1080Ti Gpu, Ubuntu 16.04)
When I run ./CarlaUE4.sh, server opens up fine, but when I try to connect to it with config.py client under PythonAPI/Util with a the new - x  abc.xodr. The server window crashes. With the following error.
Disabling core dumps.  Signal 11 caught. Malloc Size=65538 LargeMemoryPoolOffset=65554  CommonUnixCrashHandler: Signal=11 Malloc Size=65535 LargeMemoryPoolOffset=131119  Malloc Size=107920 LargeMemoryPoolOffset=239056  Engine crash handling finished; re-raising signal 11 for the default handler. Good bye. Segmentation fault (core dumped)
What could be the reason for crash? I tried with ./CarlaUE4.sh - opengl and  ./CarlaUE4.sh  -opengl3  args also, but it still crashes.

		The same problem.
And the Nvidia driver for me 440, OS is 18.04, OpenGL is 4.6
It always raises the error: signal 11 when I spawn the pedestrians.
Here is the detailed report:
4.24.3-0+++UE4+Release-4.24 518 0
Disabling core dumps.

Is there any solution?

		Hi,
All seems that the .xodr could be malformed. Can you share that file? Have you tried with the last patch version 0.9.9.4?
Regards

 how big is your OpenDRIVE file in MB and/or km^2?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bernatx&gt;@bernatx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I have tried with the latest 0.9.9.4 patch version as well, still throws the same Segmentation fault error. Attaching two of the xodr's below FYR.

 , I have tried using various sized maps. Below I'm attaching 2 files FYR, one is 5MB, other is 20MB and both throw the same error. Not really sure about km^2 though.
