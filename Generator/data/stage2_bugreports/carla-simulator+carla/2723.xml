	<summary>Segmentation fault using world.GetMap()</summary>
	<description>
Hello all. I have been using carla for a few months now. However, today I encountered a strange situation. I formatted my laptop and after formatting carla does not seem to work on my system any more. After a lot of debugging I encountered the issue is when I try to call get_world() method. It gives segmentation fault. Any idea why?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ndeshp2s&gt;@ndeshp2s&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Can you provide any log?
Are you working with the package version of Carla or you compile Carla yourself?

		I´m getting the same error, stacktrace is the same like in: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/2079&gt;#2079&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I´m compiling CarlaLib myself following the instructions for the c++ client on this page:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/master/Examples/CppClient&gt;https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/master/Examples/CppClient&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
