	<summary>semantic segmentation does not work properly on props ingestion- version 0.9.8 linux from source</summary>
	<description>
Hello
working on carla release 0.9.8 on linux from source
after prop ingestion (using json file with tag e.g. -  {
"maps": [
],"props": [
{      "name": "MyProp01",      "size": "big",      "source": "./props/prop01/prop01.fbx",      "tag": "Vehicles"} ]} )
the image that I get with semantic segmentation sensor colores the object in black (so my tag has no effect).
I found out the "render custom" is disabled on  my prop after start playing , comparing to other constant actors in the scene,  so perhaps this should be fixed
Thanks
