	<summary>sensor_tick property ignored for GNSS, Radar and IMU</summary>
	<description>
After troubleshooting why sensor_tick for IMU didn't change the frequency of the ROS message I noticed the ego_vehicle.py doesn't read the property. This is true for GNSS, radar and IMU sensors. Adding the
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;try:
    bp.set_attribute('sensor_tick', str(sensor_spec['sensor_tick']))
except KeyError:
    pass
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

snippet fixes the issue.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Kipt&gt;@Kipt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Sorry for the delay. I missed this issue. Could you open a PR in the ros-bridge introducing the fix. Otherwise, I'll do it myself.

		Thanks for checking this out &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/joel-mb&gt;@joel-mb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

As the commit I have is based on a ROS-bridge repository that's heavily modified already I think it's faster if you do the change.
