	<summary>Multiple "SceneCaptureToDiskCamera" mix up saved images</summary>
	<description>
How to reproduce

Add at least two SceneCaptureToDiskCameras to the scene
Set their "Save to Folder" different for each camera
Set their "Post Process Effect" different for each camera
Play

Each camera saves in its own folder but the resulting images seem to be somehow mixed up.

		Ok &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nsubiron&gt;@nsubiron&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the problem is that the Render Target is being shared because the property is defined as Transient. I've also fixed a bug in the constructor naming, btw, we will need to change this SaveToFolder to be checked in runtime because it is different in production than in editor.
