walkers will detect cars and stop, but in the end they will touch the car and die

		Another problem related to this is the way the pedestrian detects vehicles in the world. The perception angle is too wide sometimes so they could be walking inside the road and detects a car, thus making the walker to stop and wait 10 seconds until the next decision makes the vehicle to wait for the walker. Maybe we should reduce the angle

		Related to this, pedestrians tend to stand by cars and then die dramatically.
