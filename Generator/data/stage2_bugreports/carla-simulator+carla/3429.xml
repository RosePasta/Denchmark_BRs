	<summary>Randomized vehicle license plates not working</summary>
	<description>
The randomized license plate feature is not working. According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md#carla-041&gt;CARLA 0.4.1 Changelog&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the "randomized vehicle license plates" is supported since 0.4.1. The documentation for &lt;denchmark-link:https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_A_vehicle_modelling/&gt;vehicle modeling&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 also mentions license plate texture and there is a blueprint (BaseVehiclePawn &gt; License Plate) defined for license plates. There are license plate textures assets accessible from  however I cannot find any documentation that explains how the default license plate can be changed.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ebadi&gt;@ebadi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I will look into it. I'll let you know if I find something.

		It is very much appreciated &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Madecu&gt;@Madecu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I don't have much experience in unreal engine and 3D modelling but I would be glad to contribute as much as I can, if pointers/references are provided.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ebadi&gt;@ebadi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I found that we had had this feature disabled for a while. If you want to enable it, you just need to do the next two steps:
First, connect the LicensePlate function to the EventGraph
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54811869/96129199-a3560780-0ef6-11eb-8c62-2dbf660cf2ed.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Second, you need to delete a node that is no longer functioning and replaced it with "Random Integer"
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54811869/96129434-e7490c80-0ef6-11eb-8881-9e02552a9c24.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Bonus track. If you want to change the player's license plate too, connect the "True" output to this node:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54811869/96129787-5b83b000-0ef7-11eb-95a7-e4b56ce8b759.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I hope this helps you

		Thank you. I tried it and it works now. :)
I think there are other issues like some license plates keeping their default values. I close this issue and try to look deeper later. If it was relevant to this issue, I reopen this, otherwise I report a new issue and tag you there.
Thank you so much &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Madecu&gt;@Madecu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
