		Same issue here, when trying to compile LibCarla on its own.
Installing libmsgpack-dev does not help.
OS: Ubuntu 20.04

 could you take a look at this? It seems to be an active problem.

		Hi,
That file is part of the RPC library. We have a forked RPC library, and that file is still there:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;https://github.com/carla-simulator/rpclib.git
TAG: v2.2.1_c2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

You should have the file for example in carla\Build\rpclib-install\include\rpc\msgpack.hpp
Regards
