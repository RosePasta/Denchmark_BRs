	<summary>'make import' only imports the open drive file but no models</summary>
	<description>
Hi guys, I have some problem with the command 'make import'. When I try to import my own map, which is created from RoadRunner,  by using make import, it only imports the open drive file, but no model was imported in the UE4 editor. In another word, it will generate a series of waypoints with an empty world.
Dose anyone know what happens here?
Thanks!

I got this log message, but how could know where this error happens?

 since you are working on the import pipeline these days, could you take a look at this, please?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZhengZhongyuan11&gt;@ZhengZhongyuan11&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you prepare your map to be shared with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/marcgpuig&gt;@marcgpuig&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
