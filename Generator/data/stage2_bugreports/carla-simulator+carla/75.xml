	<summary>Missing Glass texture</summary>
	<description>
When running CarlaServer 0.7.0, the log outputs a warning about missing the Glass texture and it seems like the streetlights are missing their glass casings. Is this the intended behavior?
Relevant log output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;LogMaterial: Warning: Material /Game/AutomotiveMaterials/Materials/Glass/M_Glass.M_Glass
missing bUsedWithInstancedStaticMeshes=True! Default Material will be used in game.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Yes, we are actually taking a look at this. They are two different issues, we already fixed the missing texture in the streetlights for the next release, and we are investigating why it gives warning in the glass material.
