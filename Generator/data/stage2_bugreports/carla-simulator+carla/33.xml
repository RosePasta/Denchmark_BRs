	<summary>Get images from the game</summary>
	<description>
I am able to get the server and client to run.  I loook though the python example.py.  I am trying to have the image and user action save so I can try out behavior cloning.  However I canâ€™t seem to get image save although I set save image to true in the python example file.  I

		I edited the carla_manual_control.py to allow for image and data recording.  I am currently after imitation learning.  My goal is for be able to interface with Keras model to allow for the model to drive the car.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/naveen7v&gt;@naveen7v&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
You can check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/PythonClient/client_example.py&gt;client_example.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to see how is done. You can save the images there by running with the  switch
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ ./client_example.py -i
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Internally, the images received from the simulator have a member function to save the image as png
measurements, sensor_data = client.read_data()

for name, measurement in sensor_data.items():
    measurement.save_to_disk('filename.png')

Dear sir...the client_example.py is as you say and i ran it with the -i switch,
but the client.read_data() returns a empty sensor_data dict... but measurements are there
I just have rgb camera sensor enabled...is it a problem in my side?
Edit:
When i ran the carla server using the build from source method ...the sensor data are saved to disk
Thank you
