		Why exactly is this done? I see in the code that the speed is hard coded to be 10 km/h lower than the limit.

 yes, you have a point. The autopilot is some legacy code we have full of magic numbers, and in my experience every time I have changed something there, the vehicles start having accidents all the time. Since so far hasn't been much of a priority and for now just works we haven't fixed it. But soon, with the addition with better support for more complex maps that we plan to add (multiple lanes, complex intersections, etc), this autopilot is going obsolete and we'll need to add a better one that understands the new map definitions. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/marcgpuig&gt;@marcgpuig&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/germanros1987&gt;@germanros1987&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are working on that, keep tuned ;)
