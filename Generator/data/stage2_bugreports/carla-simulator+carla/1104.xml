	<summary>Loosing the wheels</summary>
	<description>
Hi, below is method for "unscreewing the wheels" in most (all?) vehicles.
import carla
import random
c = carla.Client('localhost', 2000)
w = c.get_world()
vbs = w.get_blueprint_library().filter('vehicle*')
vb = random.choice(vbs)
sp = w.get_map().get_spawn_points()[0]
v = w.spawn_actor(vb, sp)
sp.rotation.pitch = -90
sp.location.z = 40
w.get_spectator().set_transform(sp)
v.set_simulate_physics(False)
v.apply_control(carla.VehicleControl(throttle=10.0))
v.set_simulate_physics(True)
OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Carla: 0.9.2 from official release

		Why would you want to do that? Of course if you disable physics your car won't move accordingly if you apply control.

		It was just play with API. I don't claim it is logic/common sequence of operations.
You are right when disabled physics before appling control to car it wouldn't move.
But when you enable physics again - car body will move, while wheels will stay in place. I think it is a bug.

		This seems to be the same problem as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/1001&gt;#1001&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . But in the full list of changes section of the &lt;denchmark-link:http://carla.org/2018/12/24/release-0.9.2/#full-list-of-changes&gt;0.9.2 release,&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it's declared that this problem has been fixed up (the last third line).

		You are right - it is the same issue.
Confirming that I'm using official 0.9.2 build.

		I think it is related but different than &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/1001&gt;#1001&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, only some vehicles were loosing the wheels and it was due a corruption of their physics asset in UE4. That was already fixed in 0.9.2. Not sure what's causing this, we should investigate.
