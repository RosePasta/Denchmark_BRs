	<summary>[0.9.5] OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long</summary>
	<description>
I get the following error when I run manual_contorl.py from the pre-built release:  OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long at line 416
'Simulation time: % 12s' % datetime.timedelta(seconds=int(self.simulation_time)),
Has anyone encountered this issue?

		Simulation time is a double internally, it might be too big to pass as an int to datetime.

		I identified the problem - I had not added the correct .egg to the PYTHONPATH. I added the one for 0.9.4 instead of 0.9.5. Works now!
