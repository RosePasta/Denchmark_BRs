	<summary>Issues with two-wheeled vehicles</summary>
	<description>
Moving the known issues of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/477&gt;#477&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to its own issue.
Known issues:

 Control is still not perfect. Though the AI has almost no problem driving the bikes human control is still clumsy.
 Due to the physics constraint used to make the bikes ride straight, the slightest bump on the road makes the bike jump.
 Hand and Feet animation are not perfect, some feet might go through the floor and some hands might hover over the handler.
 Vehicle wheels bone axis must be aligned with world axis to work and most bikes handlers are not world aligned, this causes the wheel and the handler to behave differently while steering in some ocassions.
