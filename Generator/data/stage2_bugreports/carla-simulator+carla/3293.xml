	<summary>Cannot download any release before 0.9.5</summary>
	<description>
Tried Chrome and Firefox, both in Incognito mode:

Firefox just gives me a white screen
Chrome: "Access to doc-14-2k-docs.googleusercontent.com was denied"


This happens for any Linux release before 0.9.5 from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases&gt;releases page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		I can't reproduce this error. Could it be a temporary problem with google drive? Does the problem persist?

		It seems to work again now, might have been a temporary issue.
