	<summary>Docker build issue: Error: Couldn't find parent type for 'CarlaLightSubsystem' named 'UWorldSubsystem' in current module or any other module parsed so far</summary>
	<description>
I am facing this issue in ubuntu 18.04, when I run docker build -t carla -f Carla.Dockerfile .

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23289685/86204368-f349d200-bb84-11ea-9b2b-c1563f79418e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Anyone knows the solution for this?
I followed these steps: &lt;denchmark-link:https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_A_add_map/&gt;https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_A_add_map/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I had the same issue but I managed to go around it by building the supported docker version of UE4 for the Carla version I'm using. You can check in the Prerequisites.Dockerfile at the top which one it should be. I used the latest release of Carla which at the top of the file it says ARG UE4_V=4.24.3. So I built that version ( ue4-docker build 4.24.3 --no-engine --no-minimal) instead of 4.22.2 which is stated in the guide your using and it worked fine.

		We will update that file so it says 4.24 instead of 4.22 to avoid confusions.
Thanks for the warning.
