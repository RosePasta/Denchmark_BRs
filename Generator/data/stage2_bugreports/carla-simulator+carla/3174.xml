		Hi All, i want to load LAS data in carla simulator for this am using config.py script i tried to modify the script.
elif args.las_path is not None:
if os.path.exists(args.las_path):
with open(args.las_path,encoding='ANSI') as od_file:
try:
data = od_file.read()
except OSError:
print('file could not be readed.')
sys.exit()
print('load opendrive map %r.' % os.path.basename(args.las_path))
vertex_distance = 2.0  # in meters
max_road_length = 50.0 # in meters
wall_height = 1.0      # in meters
extra_width = 0.6      # in meters
world = client.generate_opendrive_world(
data, carla.OpendriveGenerationParameters(
vertex_distance=vertex_distance,
max_road_length=max_road_length,
wall_height=wall_height,
additional_width=extra_width,
smooth_junctions=True,
enable_mesh_visibility=True))
this parameters i am using but getting error while loading.Thanks for any help.
ERROR: time-out of 10000ms while waiting for the simulator,make sure simulator is ready and connected to localhost:2000

 I will ask &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Axel1092&gt;@Axel1092&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to take a look at this, but in the meantime let me ask you an entry-level question: is the server running? If so, did you try increasing the timeout of the client to 20 sec?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Bhavani56&gt;@Bhavani56&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, did the increase of the timeout solve your problem? If the map is very large you may need to increase the timeout even further.
