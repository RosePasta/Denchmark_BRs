 I think this was fixed with 0.9.9.4, or not?

		Hi,
As far as I know, according to what we discussed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/issues/556&gt;this issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the problem is fixed with 0.9.9.4. Please try with this version of CARLA and let us know!

		Hi everyone.. I need some help.
I setup CARLA on a Google VM and I have tried setting up the scenario_runner as well but I have been met with different challenges. I am able to run the PythonAPI examples of CARLA but not the manual_control.py of scenario_runner. It keeps saying "Waiting for the ego vehicle..." or "Scenario Not Ready". When I also tried running python scenario_runner.py --scenario FollowLeadingVehicle_1 --reloadWorld it returns "Not all tests were successful". I have tried using (same versions for carla and scenario runner) v0.9.8 and 0.9.9. The error I get on my server is "unable to parse the OpenDrive XML string"

 I have been able to fix this issue with  by spawning a hero vehicle before passing the world object to the WorldSR class in  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner/blob/master/manual_control.py&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I will like to know the originally intended behavior. Thanks
