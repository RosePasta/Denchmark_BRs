	<summary>WheelPhysicsControl content misleading/invalid</summary>
	<description>
I see some issues with WheelPhysicsControl:
1. Missleading name
The WheelPhysicsControl has a member steer_angle.
This is somehow misleading, as it's not the current angle but most likely the max angle.
To clarify things, we should rename it to max_steer_angle.
2. disable_steering always false
I see that for my vehicle the member disable_steering is always false.
I would assume, that this member shows which wheel is fixed (disable_steering=True), and which one can turn (disable_steering=False).
Also, maybe we can get rid of the negation by using is_steerable.

		It would also make sense to be able to identify each wheel. Currently VehiclePhysicsControl only contains an array of wheels.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fpasch&gt;@fpasch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Sorry for late reply, just checked again and indeed you are right!
I've included the corresponding changes about renaming those 2 parameters in branch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/pull/1562&gt;#1562&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and made a PR already.
Thank you very much for your feedback. Really appreciate it!
