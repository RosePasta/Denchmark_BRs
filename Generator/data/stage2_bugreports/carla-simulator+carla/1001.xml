	<summary>SetSimulatePhysics(true) results in some strange behavior for vehicle.carlamotors.carlacola</summary>
	<description>
The first time I found this problem was when I spawned a vehicle.carlamotors.carlacola and then called  SetSimulatePhysics(True) on it. Two of its four wheels dropped off immediately after the vehicle appeared in the scene. After I deleted the call to SetSimulatePhysics, everything goes well.
Then I tested it in manual_control.py.

Add a line in World.__init__(), after the self.world.spawn_actor() like the following:

self.vehicle = self.world.spawn_actor(blueprint, spawn_point)
self.vehicle.set_simulate_physics(True)

Choose "vehicle.carlamotors.carlacola" blueprint for vehicle in _get_random_blueprint:

def _get_random_blueprint(self):
       #bp = random.choice(self.world.get_blueprint_library().filter('vehicle'))
       bp = self.world.get_blueprint_library().find("vehicle.carlamotors.carlacola")
       if bp.has_attribute('color'):
           color = random.choice(bp.get_attribute('color').recommended_values)
           bp.set_attribute('color', color)
       return bp

Run manual_control.py. Then control the vehicle to move, and strange thing happens: all wheels won't move together with the vehicle body, and only the body are under control.

The carla version I'm using is release 0.9.1ï¼Œand the unreal version is 4.19.
