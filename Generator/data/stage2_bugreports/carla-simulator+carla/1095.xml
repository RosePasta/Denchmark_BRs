		The origin of the Carla Map is inside the fountain of the roundabout. At (0, 0, 0) you cannot spawn a vehicle. Try (0, 0, 20) and the vehicle will fall down from above or choose a location near to (0, 0) which is at ground level.

		The usual cause of this message is a collision at the spawn point, it can be because there is another, a building, or any other obstacle.
The main problem here is the lack of information, the spawn function actually returns a string with the cause of failure but there is a problem retrieving this message on the client-side. I'll add this issue to our backlog to track this problem.
