	<summary>Bug in Docker pipeline to create .BIN</summary>
	<description>
There is a bug in the Docker pipeline that does not create the .BIN automatically if the nomenclature is not the standard. This only affects pedestrian navigation.
The workaround until the fix is to recreate the .BIN by hand with the tools and tutorial we have here:
