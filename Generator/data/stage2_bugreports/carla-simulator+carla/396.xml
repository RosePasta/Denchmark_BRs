	<summary>Foliage culling uses the wrong distance in Low Mode</summary>
	<description>
There is a problem with foliage culling using quality mode set to Low. When you are close to parts of the foliage seems like it uses a different origin of the foliage mesh. This is because the instanced foliage actor is using max culling instead of the foliage culling system.
