	<summary>Semantic Tag for new props does not work Carla 0.9.9</summary>
	<description>
Window version build from source ( 0.9.9.3 )
I have add the new props to .json file : ( Default.Package.json )
Example:
{
"name": "PedCross",
"path": "/Game/Carla/Static/Props/Street/SM_PedCross.SM_PedCross",
"size": "Small",
"tag": "TrafficSigns"
},
After build I can spawn "PedCross" sign as i need, but this "actor" does not appear on camera semantic segmentation as "TrafficSigns". ( tag ). All new props added are visible on segmentation as Unlabeled = 0 even if i specified the tag in .json file.
Can you help me to fix this issue ? Am I doing something wrong ?

		EDIT: i tried with properly tagged stop sign in town10hd and add the same stop sign in jason file with same tag. It look like this
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44050097/87913995-49b57c80-ca70-11ea-8f6b-455c250de89c.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Originally added stop sign to town is segmented with TAG = 12 correctly but spawned same sign :
{
"name": "Stop",
"path": "/Game/Carla/Static/TrafficSigns/Stop/SM_stopSign.SM_stopSign",
"size": "Small",
"tag": "TrafficSigns"
}
Is not. It appears only with TAG = 0 :

And now difference in carlalib ( c++ ) i found :
Original stop sign is such actor -&gt;
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44050097/87914318-c2b4d400-ca70-11ea-83ae-4c10201d9ca7.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It has an correct tag "semantic_tags"[1] = 12
But props actor added to map while "playing" -&gt;
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44050097/87914444-eb3cce00-ca70-11ea-9f25-ab9c038d76d1.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

has empty semantic_tags property.
