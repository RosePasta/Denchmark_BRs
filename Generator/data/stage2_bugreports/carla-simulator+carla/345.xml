	<summary>Car sensors position not relative to car center</summary>
	<description>
The sensor position are relative to the car pivot (at the road), not to the center of the bounding box. Now the server sends the agent transform.position as the center position of the bounding box.
Due to this, some transformations the we have in our python Carla module are now incorrect.

		Are the measured accelerations in x-y-z also of the pivot point of the car, instead of the accelerations of the point in the geometric center of the bounding box?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JulianoLagana&gt;@JulianoLagana&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Again, it is  who does the magic, we use their functions. Anyway, you can search more about it &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/physx/guide/Manual/RigidBodyDynamics.html&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for example.
TL;DR: Assume it's the car's center of mass.

.
Unfortunately, reading the provided link didn't answer the question. I do however understand that this is beyond what CARLA is in charge of, so I'll continue my search within PhysX (I'm actually hoping the accelerations are of the pivot point, otherwise CARLA is providing me some measurements w.r.t. the pivot point, and other measurements w.r.t. the center of mass).
Thanks for the help.
