	<summary>Some sensors ignore sensor_tick attribute [0.9.10 / 0.9.10.1]</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I use Carla to generate datasets for semantic segmentation and only need the sensor data of every xth tick. Thus i make use of the sensor attribute sensor_tick and set it to 1 or 2 (seconds).
The sensors camera.rgb, camera.semantic_segmentation and camera.depth seem to ignore the sensor_tick attribute and return data in every tick.
The sensors camera.dvs or lidar.ray_cast for example are behaving as expected.
I am using Carla 0.9.10[.1] on Windows.

		Hi there,
I am experiencing the exact same issue with the SceneCaptureSensors. I've already contacted &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/marcgpuig&gt;@marcgpuig&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and he told me the team (or he himself) is on it. :) Just wanted to bump this thread with this comment.
Best,
Gunther
