	<summary>Changing Sun Azimuth angle in CarlaWeather.ini has no effect</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to change the sun position to get shadows at different angles, however changing in CarlaWeather.ini SunAzimuthAngle=40.0
has no effect. Changing SunPolarAngle=somevalue works though. I'm using a modified level as suggested in the map customization tutorial.
Can anybody confirm this? I also tried changing it via the weather blueprint but the direction of the sunlight is always the same.

		Changing the Rotation of 'Light Source' by hand is kind of a workaround.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/simmates&gt;@simmates&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. How our weather system works now you can not change the azimuth angle from the CarlaWeather.ini file. We intended that this would make the azimuth angle native to the level, but it was not the best approach. I'm marking it as an bug and it will be fixed in the next version. We will make the azimuthal angle of CarlaWeather.ini be added to the position of the local sun.
