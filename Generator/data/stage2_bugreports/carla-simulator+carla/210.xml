	<summary>Possible memory leak in Windows Release</summary>
	<description>
Tested in version 0.7.1, after a couple of hours, the server crashes.
The log file says that unreal is trying to allocate more and more memory for each resset.
Log start and end:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[  0]Requested Allocations: 30.623291mb  (including block size padding)
...
[751]Requested Allocations: 12592.825348mb  (including block size padding)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

12 gb is too much.
