	<summary>Can't get_actors() before get_blueprint_library()</summary>
	<description>
Here is the code:
import carla
client = carla.Client("127.0.0.1", 2000)
client.set_timeout(2.0)
world = client.get_world()
blueprints = world.get_blueprint_library()   //***
actors = world.get_actors()
print ("actor num:" + str(len(actors)))
If I remove the blueprint line, the actors will be empty. Is it a designed feature? Just report the case.

		It seems a matter of timing, can you check if it works replacing the get_blueprint_library() by a time.sleep(1)?
Internally, when you request the world you subscribe to the world observer sensor that sends the list of actors and their transforms. If you are too fast you may not have received any update yet thus it will appear there are no actors.

		Yes, it works with time.sleep(1) before GetActors.
Using world.wait_for_tick() works, too.
