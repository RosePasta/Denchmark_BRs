	<summary>Command-line argument `-carla-settings` fails to load absolute paths</summary>
	<description>
Relative paths seem to work fine, but it fails to load absolute paths, not even showing the "Unable to find settings file" error.
The code in question is in  at "CarlaSettings.cpp". It seems relatively straightforward to fix with Unreal's &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/Core/Misc/FPaths/&gt;FPath&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 utils.
