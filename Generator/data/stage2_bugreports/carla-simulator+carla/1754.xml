	<summary>Collision sensor doesn't work on Tesla Model 3</summary>
	<description>
I can't seem to get the collision sensor to work when the hero vehicle is a Tesla Model 3. It works just fine when using other blueprints.
I am using a fork of Carla, commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/commit/ab7a16687ab2841ef8d7e13d6a5a276ae72bbb3f&gt;ab7a166&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (May 8 2019)
Any suggestions?

		This issue is still not fixed in newer versions of Carla, using Linux x86_64 5.5.6 and Carla 0.9.7.4.
Model 3 still doesn't work with the collision sensor, simply changing the vehicle makes it the sensor work as expected.
