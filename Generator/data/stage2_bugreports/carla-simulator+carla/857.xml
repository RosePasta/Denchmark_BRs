	<summary>Set transform of actor attached to another one should be relative</summary>
	<description>
The straight use case is changing the position of a sensor relative to the vehicle:
camera.set_location(Location(x=2.5))
the camera is sent to the world location (2.5, 0.0, 0.0) and usually breaks the attachment to the vehicle.
I would expect in this situation to set the camera relative to the vehicle that is attached to.
