it is caused by spawn camera in world, but this error won't happened at the beginning, it only happened when I running program for a while, like couple of hours. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nsubiron&gt;@nsubiron&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I'm facing a similar issue when using the ros-bridge (and starting/stopping another client).
I believe the issue is related to having two clients accessing the data.
My clients:

ros-bridge
manual_control.py

You can reproduce it like that.

execute ros-bridge
Restart manual_control.py every 4 seconds (e.g with the help of this script)

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python
import signal
import subprocess
import time

ret = 0
while ret is 0:
    pro = subprocess.Popen("./manual_control.py")
    time.sleep(4)
    pro.terminate()
    pro.wait()
    ret = pro.returncode
print("returned {}".format(ret))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Afer a few restarts of manual-control, the ROS bridge will report the error and stops.

		It looks like it's a bug inside LibCarla, related to the client objects used to subscribe to a sensor. I'll try to create a minimal test reproducing this in C++. Unfortunately we won't be able to fix it for 0.9.5.

		When runnng ros_bridge, I commented line 167 of parent.py
self.child_actors[actor_id].destroy()
This has greatly improved ros_bridge stability; I expect it is causing a double delete attempt in the python API code ...

 What you're describing is a different issue, which is, as you already stated ros-bridge only. I've create an issue in ros-bridge &gt; &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge/issues/133&gt;carla-simulator/ros-bridge#133&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This should be solved now in 0.9.8.
