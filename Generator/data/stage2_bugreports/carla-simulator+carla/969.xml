	<summary>Lane and poles are the same color in semantic segmentation</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I obtained the images from Camera Segmentation but I discovered that "RoadLines" and "Poles" classes have the same color in the images (153, 153, 153).
How can I fix this problem?
Thanks

		Hi @Capuz93,
You're right! The road lines used to be (157, 234, 50). It can be modifies in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/LibCarla/source/carla/image/CityScapesPalette.h&gt;CityScapesPalette.h&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I'm not sure what's the color in CityScapes, can't seem to find road lines there. When I did that I was using the labels &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mcordts/cityscapesScripts/blob/master/cityscapesscripts/helpers/labels.py&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		Thanks.
I changed the values in CityScapesPalette.h but the color of lanes and poles are still the same.
What should I have to do?
Thanks
