	<summary>Make launch error on ubuntu 16.04, recipe for target 'setup' failed</summary>
	<description>
I stuck at the step "make launch" when I build my carla by this link:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/&gt;https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It seems something about the compiler installation went wrong so too many "no member named" errors occurred.
PS:
OS: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Carla: master on carla github
UE4:4.24
cmake: 3.13.4
gcc/g++: 7.4.0
Here follows only part of the screen output in the "make launch" step.
Thanks!

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

		I was able to resolve this issue as following.
As it is clear that error is in llvm headers, I added following CXX flag
-nostdinc++
where LLVM headers are being included in  Util/BuildTools/Setup.sh
I searched for -I${LLVM_INCLUDE}. There are two places and
replaced -fPIC  -std=c++14 -stdlib=libc++ with
-fPIC -nostdinc++ -std=c++14 -stdlib=libc++
This solves the problem for me.

Hi, @GimpelZhang !
Did the solution provided by @villie17 served you well?

Thanks!
And thanks for the solution provided by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/villie17&gt;@villie17&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I have not tried that solution yet.
I will report the results here soon.

It seems that the "Setup.sh: Building rpclib with libc++" step has been passed, but in the step of "BuildLibCarla.sh: Building LibCarla "Server.Release" configuration" I still have many errors.
And the strange thing is the errors are in the similar type.
Here follows only part of the screen output.

		I did some experiments, and I was able to build in an Ubuntu 16.04 Docker container, where I followed the exact instructions presented in the Carla documentation, and it worked fine. So there must be some issue with the way our systems are set up. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about this to be of any use with finding the root cause.
If anyone wants it, &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/ItsTimmy/5bac0cd90400561c5b8bfbe5518c5c90&gt;here is the Dockerfile I used&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I would not recommend actually using it, because I ended up making questionable use of user IDs and volumes so that I could build carla in Docker, then run it on the host machine.

You are right. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/2797&gt;#2797&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I had also the same issue on Ubuntu 18.04 and for me it seemed to be a problem with the version of clang. After removing all the installed versions of clang and llvm, I reinstall them following carefully the instructions on the carla documentation: &lt;denchmark-link:https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/&gt;https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for your advice. However, that method does not work. I still have the same issue I posted.

		I provided a suggestion to solve the error in rpclib compilation part. However afterwards errors of the form
error: no member named 'strtol' in the global namespace
using ::strtol;
still not remained.
This error was not resolved by the suggestion I provided earlier.
So I followed the suggestion by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DSantosO&gt;@DSantosO&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and removed all clang versions as well as all llvm also. Afterwards I reinstalled clang-8 only
The original issue in rpclib as pointed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GimpelZhang&gt;@GimpelZhang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  was still there and that
I solved  by adding -nostdinc++ as pointed earlier.
The strtol errors were all resolved though by removing all clang versions and installing clang-8 only.
It successfully compiles for me now.
For rpclib compilation I still have to do a hack of adding nostdinc++ flag.
My clang version is
$ clang --version
clang version 8.0.0-3~ubuntu18.04.2 (tags/RELEASE_800/final)
Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/bin
And this is the only clang installed. clang-3.9, clang-6, clang-7 etc have all been removed. Same for llvm. only llvm-8 is installed and rest are all removed.

		Thanks for the good suggestions from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/villie17&gt;@villie17&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Finally I got this problem solved.
Because I found an update on &lt;denchmark-link:https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/&gt;https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in "Requirements-system specifics" part:

Ubuntu 18.04. Since release 0.9.9, CARLA cannot run in Ubuntu 16.04 using default compilers.

Meanwhile, I was still trying to "make launch" the newest fetch from the git master branch.
So I changed to the branch of 0.9.8, and implemented "make launch" again. After I made a few modifications according to the commit “&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/commit/6ba4d68a48cb6af2ac5d5983e6e44cd5ebb54777&gt;UE4.22 to UE4.24 upgrade.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
", the "make launch" process finally succeeded with a CarlaUE4 Editor launched.
In a word, on ubuntu 16.04, the newest branch which can be compiled should be 0.9.8. I think this issue can be closed now.
Thanks to all the replies again!
