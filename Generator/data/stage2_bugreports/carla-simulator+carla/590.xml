&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Specs:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I ran CARLA 0.8.4
Connected a client with python3
It crashed in less than 72 hours.
The number of pedestrians is 200.
Number of vehicles 0
The Bikes were not disabled but there were no vehicles
I am attaching the logs

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Nice, so it first spawns 1 vehicle then spawns -1 vehicle, seems optimal to me ðŸ˜„
This seems like an issue of the vehicle spawner that it actually tried to spawn a motorbike. I'll take a look.

		I'm not able to reproduce. I also noticed that in the last episode you actually requested 20 vehicles.

		I don't know how that would happen. I don't change the configuration file.
I  noticed that the last episode was run with something like a default configuration.
20 vehicles, 30 pedestrians, weather 1
Anyway
I tried again also disabling the bikes. I haven't seen the crash in 24 hours.
I am still having some weird connection problems. But this could be on my side.
I will retry with version 0.8.2
Thanks.

		So, conclusion.
You should set the flag:
conditions.set(DisableTwoWheeledVehicles=True)
Without this flag, it seems CARLA can crash even without vehicles..

		Still worth noticing that there is a bug in the current vehicle spawner. We are not fixing it for now as the vehicle spawner is most probably going to disappear in the 0.9.0 release.
