		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HemaZ&gt;@HemaZ&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
CARLA 0.9.9.4 is not containing the fix for this issue. You should use CARLA 0.9.10 or just update you  script by this one: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/Co-Simulation/Sumo/spawn_npc_sumo.py&gt;https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/Co-Simulation/Sumo/spawn_npc_sumo.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
