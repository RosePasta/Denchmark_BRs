	<summary>Streaming client keeps trying to reconnect after destroying a sensor</summary>
	<description>
When you subscribe to a sensor stream from the client side, a new "streaming client" is created that listens to any data generated by that sensor, on disconnect this client continuously tries to reconnect failing to read data if the sensor was destroyed.
To reproduce, just create a sensor from the client side, set the listen callback, and destroy the sensor. It starts printing warnings from that point on.
