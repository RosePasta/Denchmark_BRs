	<summary>Bad runtime generation of navmesh</summary>
	<description>
Navmesh fails to recalculate well at runtime.

Cars leave a trace of "holes" in the navmesh, pedestrians cannot enter this holes and follow weird paths to cross the road.
Navmesh fails to update a tile even though half of the vehicle lies inside the tile. Pedestrians see this part as walkable, when they try to cross they crash against the car and die.

		No longer relevant as pedestrians no longer use the navmesh.
