	<summary>Segfault when loading Open DRIVE maps</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I've stumbled on two segfaults that happen when loading maps

Ex_Simple-LaneOffset.zip
UC_Simple-X-Junction-TrafficLights.zip

I'm not sure are the bugs related but what I know is that Map::CreateRtree crashes on Ex_Simple-LaneOffset.
I'm using:
CARLA 0.9.9
Wndows 10 64bit.
