		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MRAWAY77&gt;@MRAWAY77&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

That is a problem on our part. There actually is a Physical skeleton for each vehicle we have on the project, but half of them are on the model folder and the other half in the blueprint folder of the vehicle.
We'll optimize our asset folders in the next release to avoid this kind of confusion.
