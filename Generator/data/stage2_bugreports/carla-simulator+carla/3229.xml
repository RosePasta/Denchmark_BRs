	<summary>manual_control.py exits after 2s without an error</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I compiled CARLA 0.9.9.4 and PythonAPI (on Win10). Everything worked fine, the compilation completed without errors. I opened the CarlaUE4.uproject and clicked the play button. When I run the manual_control.py script, the pygame window only shows up for 2 seconds and after that it closes with no errors.
I debugged it and found that client.get_world() gave me an error message:
[WinError 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.
I have tried other (also the compiled) versions and the result is the same.
I hope someone can help me. Thanks in advance!

		I finally found the bug in my case. I had several versions of Carla on my laptop and the system path variable CARLA_ROOT was configured for an older version of the PythonAPI.
