	<summary>Traffic Manager doesn't react on multiple speed changes</summary>

Hello, currently I am working with multiple (around 200) vehicles that are subscribed to one traffic manager with the autopilot on. In my project I need to change multiple times the speed of individual vehicles, but I noticed that sometimes the traffic manager doesn't react to speed changes. For example, in the code below the simulation reacts to the first speed change, but after the timeout the same vehicles won't speed up.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tm = client.get_trafficmanager(8000)
for npc in npc_list:
    tm.vehicle_percentage_speed_difference(npc, 90.0)

time.sleep(10)

for npc in npc_list:
    tm.vehicle_percentage_speed_difference(npc, 30.0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Do I need to create batches and apply them with the "apply_batch_sync()" method? If so, how would that work? Or is the issue somewhere else?
