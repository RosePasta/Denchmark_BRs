	<summary>Deadlock when closing the simulator while a client is connected</summary>
	<description>
To reproduce:

Launch the simulator (game or editor)
Connect a client
Stop the simulation

Version 0.9.0 at least both Linux and Windows.
My bet goes to this piece of code where the future.get() may block forever



carla/LibCarla/source/carla/rpc/Server.h


        Lines 59 to 61
      in
      a1684ad






 auto result = task.get_future(); 



 io.post([&amp;]() mutable { task(); }); 



 return result.get();

		This seemed to be a deadlock in the streaming server when the client didn't close the connection properly.
