		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shizhuocaoa&gt;@shizhuocaoa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Can you provide more information about your setup? Is the manual control (without using ROS) working? Try running the  script provided inside .
Please, take a look to the solution of this similar issue also (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/991&gt;#991&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		I seemed have met the same problem,u can try change to install new pygame version using "pip install " rather than "apt".

		Installing pygame using "install" solved my issue too! I used the following command: python2 -m pip install -U pygame --user
Then running manual_control.py using python2.7 rather than python3.6.
With python3.6, I am getting ImportError even when running spawn_npc.py. However, with python2.7 it works fine.
