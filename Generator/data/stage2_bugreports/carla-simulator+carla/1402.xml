	<summary>Cannot refer to LaneChange.None because None is a reserved word</summary>
	<description>
In CARLA 0.9.4, the LaneChange enum has a value None, but because that is a reserved word in Python, there is no way to refer to this value using normal Python syntax:
&gt;&gt;&gt; import carla
&gt;&gt;&gt; carla.LaneChange.None
  File "&lt;input&gt;", line 1
    carla.LaneChange.None
                        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
If you want to test a LaneChange to see if it has this value, you have to use the name attribute:
if lane_change.name == 'None':
    ...
It would be better if you picked a different name for this value.
