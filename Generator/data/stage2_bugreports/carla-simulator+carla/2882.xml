	<summary>make PyhtonAPI error on Windows.</summary>
	<description>
Hello. I tried to build Carla on Windows but I've got this error on the command make PythonAPI. I searched a little bit and tried to install libpng on Windows from the official site, add it to the path but it still doesn't work. Even thought it says "successfully build" the C:\carla\PythonAPI\carla\dist folder was not created. Any ideas of what I can do?

		Do not install 3rd lib by yourself.
let Make command download and compile it in Build directory

check your Build directory had libpng-1.2.37-install directory



make PythonAPI will copy png.h file to  ./PythonAPI\carla\dependencies\include  directory

		The files png.h and pngconf.h are missing in my include directory, maybe the make command could not copy them

		Maybe it helps. I installed a x64 version of python 3.7.7
I think the one I had before was x86 (32 bits version) and it does't work. So after the installation and make clean, make launch it worked for me.

		Hi, that could be the case. We are facing some issues when users are using the x32 version of Python. Please be sure to use the x64 version of Python, and version 3.7.2 if possible, because last version of Python gives some linker problems with boost. We are still investigating.
