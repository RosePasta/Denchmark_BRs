	<summary>Collisions are not annotated when vehicle's speed is low</summary>
	<description>
Currently there is a hard-coded limit of 1 km/h to avoid annotating unwanted collisions from other agents when the player is not moving (due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7&gt;#7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mostly).
However, it seems to miss collisions when the car moves slightly faster too, around 5 km/h. This should be fixed because at 5 km/h the car is definitively moving.
