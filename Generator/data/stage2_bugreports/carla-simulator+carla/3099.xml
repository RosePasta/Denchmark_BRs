		That error looks like you're using a Python Egg without RSS enabled. Please ensure, that

you've build it with rss enabled (e.g. make PythonAPI.rss.2)
the search order in your PYTHONPATH is pointing to the right egg.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fpasch&gt;@fpasch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  Sorry for the late replay.
A1. Yes i have built it with rss enabled only difference is i haven't mentioned version like u have suggested. B'coz since make PythonAPI.rss it self takes care of generating egg for python versions.
A2. For Python2 API its pointing to the right path as well as for Python3 if not it would have thrown the carla NoModule Found error.
