	<summary>Using matplotlib figure show() method instead of plt.show()</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I would like to upload plots to my experiment.
I am not using plt.show() as the sample demonstrates.
I am using figure object with fig.show(), is it possible to have this figure uploaded to the experiment?
Thanks
