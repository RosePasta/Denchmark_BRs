	<summary>FileNotFoundError occurs when I load pretrained model</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm using PyTorch+TRAINS with single calling on the top of codes.
I load pretrained model manually with following code:
state_dict = torch.load(
    path, # pathlib.Path 
    map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage
)
Then, TRAINS make unexpected behavior like below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/home/ubuntu/work/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx.py", line 50, in __init__
    map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage
  File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/torch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trains/binding/frameworks/__init__.py", line 25, in _inner_patch
    raise ex
  File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/torch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trains/binding/frameworks/__init__.py", line 23, in _inner_patch
    ret = patched_fn(original_fn, *args, **kwargs)
  File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/torch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trains/binding/frameworks/pytorch_bind.py", line 92, in _load
    model = original_fn(filename or f, *args, **kwargs)
  File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/torch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/serialization.py", line 382, in load
    f = open(f, 'rb')
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'xxxx.pth'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seems TRAINS automatically detects something and tries to load pth file with a wrong path.
Please give some descriptions about this behavior?
As I don't currently want any more functionality, I want to make it off if I can.

 , I just reproduced the bug.
The bug is lack of support for pathlib.path object. It will be fixed for next RC version.
Meanwhile you can use string:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;state_dict = torch.load(
    path.as_posix(), # pathlib.Path 
    map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Let me know if it solved the problem

		ðŸŽ‰ We fixed the bug, it should now work with your original code (pathlib.Path)
You can test it with:
pip install trains==0.10.5rc0
