	<summary>Async model checkpoint upload fails when the file is renamed</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

While using TrainsLogger in Pytorch-Lightning, the latter saves model checkpoint via _atomic_save function, which renames the file right after calling torch.save. Consequently, train's hook on torch.save tries to asynchronously upload .ckpt.part file and fails.
The original issue on Pytorch-Lightning Github: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/1466&gt;PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning#1466&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think the best solution is for Trains to create a copy of the file and upload it in the background. That said the name will still end with .part

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/iakremnev&gt;@iakremnev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Seems like any renaming or deleting a stored model file before the async upload is completed will cause this error. What we will do is create a temp copy of the model file, upload it and then delete the temp file when upload is completed.

Please see if the latest RC fixes the problem:
pip install trains==0.14.2rc0

 Is this really fixed? I'm facing the same issue. I use and   through  of  as follow:
logger = TrainsLogger(auto_connect_frameworks=True)
