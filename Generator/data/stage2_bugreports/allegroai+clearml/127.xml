	<summary>Scalar series labels in compare adding random html after action</summary>
	<description>
The series labels start out ok, but the moment I do anything (zoom, hover, etc.) the random html appears.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/WillNichols726&gt;@WillNichols726&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The bug is verified, I can reproduce it on Firefox and on Chrome, regardless of the host OS.
A quick fix:  once you are done with zooming the page, if you refresh the page, the legend will go back to normal.
BTW,
I was only able to reproduce this behavior by changing the zoom of the entire page (with either ctrl+wheel or ctrl+plus/minus)
What did you mean by "the moment I do anything (zoom, hover, etc.)"?
Hover seems to work for me, and also enabling/disabling a specific series on the graph...

 As per my second comment, I only see the bug when doing whole page zooms.
And as always, thanks again for such an awesome ML platform!
