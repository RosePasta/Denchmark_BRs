T := tf64.NewTensor(tf64.WithShape(8, 10), tf64.WithBacking(tf64.RangeFloat64(0, 80)))
T2, _ := T.Slice(ss(0))
T2.T()

fmt.Printf("%v\n", T2.AP)
yields:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Shape: (10, 1), Stride: [1], Dims: 2, Lock: false
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Should be:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Shape: (10), Stride: [1], Dims, 1, Lock false
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Further investigation shows that this bug is entirely due to an issue in the T()  and Slice() method, which doesn't play that well with views.
