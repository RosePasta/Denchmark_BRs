	<summary>Root __init__.py is not included in the distribution file</summary>
	<description>
The title says it all. This results in the following behaviour.
Ways to reproduce:

Install the package (either build locally or from pip).
Try to run import pytorch_metric_learning; pytorch_metric_learning.__version__.

Expected:
Expected to see version information.
Actual:
Error AttributeError: module 'pytorch_metric_learning' has no attribute '__version__'.
It is still possible to get version number like this:
import pkg_resources
pkg_resources.get_distribution("pytorch_metric_learning").version
but I think that .__version__ is easier.
One way to fix it is to move folder pytorch_metric_learning under src and change setup.py a bit.
I can make a PR for this if this is not by design.
