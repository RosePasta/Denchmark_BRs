How can I solve it? It still works well a few hours before.

 Are you using the latest byteps commit to build your own docker image, or using our  image?
If you build the docker by your own, would you fallback to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bytedance/byteps/commit/ba6b63b5f54b39d912463904629a90236b297f81&gt;ba6b63b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and try again? We just updated the nccl version from 2.4.2 to 2.4.8 in the dockerfile (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bytedance/byteps/pull/182&gt;#182&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), right before you raised this issue.
