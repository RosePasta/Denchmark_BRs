	<summary>VAD infer script looks broken</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to perform Voice Activity Detection with NeMo using the script vad_infer.py that is included in the examples. However, the following error comes at first:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/diego/Sutherland/speechanalytics/speechanalyticsapi/speechanalytics/test.py", line 159, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "/home/diego/Sutherland/speechanalytics/speechanalyticsapi/speechanalytics/test.py", line 89, in main
    'trim_silence': False,
  File "/home/diego/miniconda3/envs/speechanalytics/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nemo/collections/asr/models/classification_models.py", line 110, in setup_test_data
    self._test_dl = self._setup_dataloader_from_config(config=test_data_config)
  File "/home/diego/miniconda3/envs/speechanalytics/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nemo/collections/asr/models/classification_models.py", line 89, in _setup_dataloader_from_config
    batch_size=config['batch_size'],
KeyError: 'batch_size'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I've been able to fix it by including the parameter batch_size in the dict passed to the vad_model.setup_data method. After that, the script runs til the end, but it behaves in an unexpected way as it generates only one prediction value (one float) per audio file, while it should be generating one prediction per frame in every audio file... shouldn't it?
Environment
Nemo Toolkit version 1.0.0b2

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/diego-fustes&gt;@diego-fustes&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  Thanks for reporting this.
You don't need to include the parameter batch_size in the dict passed.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/9da1d27ddd7f1d5d9b6cd75f7308787976680dd8/nemo/collections/asr/models/classification_models.py#L167&gt;It's been set here.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

There isn't a vad_infer.py in v1.0.0b2. Could you please try main branch and let me know if you still have this issue and share a demo manifests if possible? Thanks!

 ,
you are right, I was running the script from the main branch, but my installed NeMo version was v1.0.0b2. Updating to the main branch fixed the issue. Many thanks!
