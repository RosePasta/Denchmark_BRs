		Do you mean v1.0.0b2? I haven't seen a b3 version yet, but there is a branch called r1.0.0b3.

		Well, I assumed since there is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases/tag/v1.0.0b3&gt;v1.0.0b3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 release, then is should be docker image for that version.

		Sorry, I missed the 1.0.0b3 release, you are correct! In the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/v1.0.0b3&gt;v1.0.0b3 README&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 there appear to be updated instructions but it appears your command is correct so the docker container is indeed missing. I was unable to retrieve it as well.

		Try pulling nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:1.0.0b3, it should be live now.
