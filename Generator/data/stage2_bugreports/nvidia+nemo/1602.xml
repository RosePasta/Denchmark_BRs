	<summary>docker container cannot launch tensorboard</summary>
	<description>
Hi all,
I was running the docker container using this command
docker run --gpus all -it --rm -v /mnt/NeMo:/NeMo --shm-size=8g \
-p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit \
stack=67108864 --device=/dev/snd nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:1.0.0b3
and the NeMo repository was on branch 1.0.0b3.
In this container, I have successfully trained my model but when I was trying to monitor my training using tensorboard using the following command,
tensorboard --bind_all --logdir .
the error appeared.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TensorFlow installation not found - running with reduced feature set.
Traceback (most recent call last):

    from tensorboard.plugins.graph import dlprof_pb2
ImportError: cannot import name 'dlprof_pb2'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

		Hi, i think i solved the problem.
After you pull the container and run it, send a pip list command and search for something called tensorboard-plugine-dlproof.
Uninstall it.
Then:
pip uninstall -y tensorboard
pip install nvidia-pyindex
pip install nvidia-tensorboard-plugin-dlprof
As nvidia said here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorboard-plugin-user-guide/&gt;https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorboard-plugin-user-guide/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Care about uninstall the tensorboard dlprof plugin before follow the guide. If you don't uninstall nemo will return you an error because dlprof is duplicated.
Bye

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lodm94&gt;@lodm94&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , thanks for the response
I've tried your method but tensorboard command does not exist anymore. Do you face the same problem? Isn't nvidia-tensorboard-plugin-dlprof supposed to installed tensorboard?

		Yeah i guess i faced that too.
Try  this pipeline:

pull the container
run it
pip uninstall -y tensorboard
pip uninstall tensorboard-plugine-dlproof (check if i spelled correctly!!!)
pip install nvidia-pyindex
pip install nvidia-tensorboard-plugin-dlprof
pip install tensorboard

then i can launch tensorboard with:
tensorboard --logdir yourpathtofiles --bind_all --port yourport
and i open a browser typing 192.168.xxx.xxx:yourport
i guess the this two commands are persoonal. for start, apologize if i am not accurate with the istruction. i'm kinda noob about all this. i am working on my thesis so I don't have much experience.
if you dont solve on monday i can log into my server again and i will copy all the steps.
it will be great if someone experienced could help you. and also me of course.
cheers
