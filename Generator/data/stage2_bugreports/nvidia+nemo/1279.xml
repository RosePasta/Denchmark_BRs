	<summary>Incompatible SAMPLE_RATE</summary>

Describe the bug
Arises when a microphone of a different sample frequency is used to run /tutorials/02_Online_ASR_Microphone_Demo.ipynb
Working on a fix as well!
Steps/Code to reproduce bug
run the ipython notebook found at /tutorials/02_Online_ASR_Microphone_Demo.ipynb
at the last cell. a SAMPLE_RATE of 16000 or 16khz is expected. This cannot be the case always. A simple approach might be to transform the input frequency to the expected frequency using LCM -&gt; Upscaling -&gt; Downscaling. Working on a PR for the same

		this notebook was written for models which we distributed and those are in 16Khz.
You are right that different sampling rate won't work there and re-sampling would be needed. But this looks more like a feature request to add to the notebook rather than bug to me. Feel free to send a PR with it.
Closing this issue as this is not a bug
