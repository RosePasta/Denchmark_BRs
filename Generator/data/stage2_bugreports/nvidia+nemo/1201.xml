		It is working fine when I open the link on colab and run it. Have you tried factory reset option from the runtime menu of the colab?

		<comment id='2' author='suyashjoshi' date='2020-09-22T21:13:53Z'>
		Another question: which branch are you using, main or master?

		I ran it on master, that was another thing to not the steps weren't clear which branch names are there that we can type - perhaps the code can just hardcode of the branch names.

I remember doing a reset as it mentioned in the cell but I can try again.

		We do not update the master anymore. The branch is called main. I would hardcode that in the tutorial in a PR to be merged very soon today.
