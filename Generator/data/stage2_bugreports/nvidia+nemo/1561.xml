	<summary>Nemo ASR silently trims silence on valid/test set</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
My assumption would be that  would be False for valid/test unless explicitly turned on. It appears that that is the intention &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/f0378b10cdadc82752d70032bd80219e531519c0/nemo/collections/asr/models/configs/ctc_models_config.py#L66&gt;here in the CTC Models Config&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is to have  for training but not validation. Also all the ASR configs for the tutorials have an explicit  for train and no entry for validation, implying that the default is False.
I believe the default is set to True &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/c0fedd91e316a4ba95ac6b14330ff92844c56097/nemo/collections/asr/data/audio_to_text_dataset.py#L46&gt;here in audio_to_text_dataset.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Steps/Code to reproduce bug
Print out the duration of the audio in the validation loop for some dataset, then set params["model"]["validation_ds"]["trim_silence"] = False and try it again and some of the audios will be of different length because they are no longer being trimmed.
Expected behavior
Validation silence trimming defaults to False, or the documentation changes to make it more explicit that silence is being trimmed during validation/inference.
Environment overview (please complete the following information)
-Colab + Nemo 1.0.0b2
