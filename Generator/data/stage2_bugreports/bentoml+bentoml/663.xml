	<summary>Error in execution of "bentoml get" cli command</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
just started to use bentoml 0.7.6 / bentoml 0.7.5 on Windows 10, with Python 3.6.8, TensorFlow-GPU 1.14.0 and Keras 2.2.4. Facing issue in using bentoml cli commands.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Created a bentoml service with a working model which was trained with Keras and TensorFlow-GPU 1.14.0
The created service was saved to the default location
Wanted to get the details of the saved service using cli command "bentoml get servicename"
On execution of the command the error occurs which indicates that a particular python package "fnctl" is not found

Expected behavior
The bentoml cli command get should have displayed the details of the saved service

The same error occurs for bentoml version 0.7.6/ 0.7.5/ 0.7.4
Is there any dependent package which needs to be version specific?

Environment:

OS: Windows 10 Pro ver 1909
Python 3.6.8. /BentoML Version 0.7.6 / 0.7.5 / 0.7.4

Additional context
The problem occurs with bentoml version 07.6 , 0.7.5 and 0.7.4
The list of the python packages installed in the python project environment is attached for reference.
Thanks !

 the fix has just been merged, it will be available in the coming releases soon.
If you have the same issue with using bentoml get command on windows platform to get the saved path, here's a temporary workaround for version 0.7.3-0.7.5:

The file path is actually the returned value of BentoService#save and the path will also be printed to the stdout, when creating the BentoML saved bundle.
The saved bundle files can be found under ~/bentoml/repository which is the default location

		The new release of the bentoml 0.7.7 contains the resolution to this issue. The bentoml cli commands work well on windows.
