	<summary>Prometheus metrics endpoint isn't loaded properly</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
In some scenarios, when debugging locally, the bento related metrics are not returned properly from the /metrics endpoint.
To Reproduce
Running locally using:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/danield137/d54fdf218c4f39c50fbd9289ca79cf6c#file-start_local-py&gt;https://gist.github.com/danield137/d54fdf218c4f39c50fbd9289ca79cf6c#file-start_local-py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Going to: localhost:5000/metrics, I don't see BENTO_ prefixed metrics.
Environment:

OS: MacOs
Python 3.8
BentoML 0.9.2

Additional context
I think this traces back to the way the view is generated.
It seems to be generated differently for  and vanilla.
The &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/b068b5f56ab9059645660c0536fe6adee149b175/bentoml/server/gunicorn_server.py#L39&gt;gunicorn version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 passes the specific registry, whereas the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/b875912dd377e8411d6698f504a20d31cca5e091/bentoml/server/api_server.py#L177&gt;regular one&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 doesn't, which falls back to the singleton .
When I changed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/fbcd691d3ad6baf009c20c656b1cad2beb0a4cb1/bentoml/server/instruments.py#L17&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to use the singleton registry,
from prometheus_client import Histogram, Counter, Gauge, REGISTRY
It worked properly.
I assume there is a good reason for creating a new registry, as such, perhaps the missing piece of code is just passing the correct registry from the metrics middleware &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/b875912dd377e8411d6698f504a20d31cca5e091/bentoml/server/api_server.py#L177&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I tested this locally and it seems the "/metrics" page is not showing any metrics information when using the development mode bentoml serve.  Production workloads running with bentoml serve-gunicorn should not be affected tho.
The API server is using a local registry instead of the global one because of potential race condition when running with Gunicorn. Same reason why we are using the multiple processor collector: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/v0.9.2/bentoml/server/gunicorn_server.py#L29&gt;https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/v0.9.2/bentoml/server/gunicorn_server.py#L29&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
