 I copied your command to my terminal and ran it but it did not show anything. Looking into the .py file inside the click directory showed the version as 7.0

 you can also find the version from python 
Could you try to update click to the latest version and try the delete command again and see if this error goes away?
You can update click with pip install -U click

 I updated to the latest click version 7.1.2 and the I still get the same error message. 
The difference is that some of the line numbers are changed from version 7.0

		Thank you for discovering this bug! &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/palver7&gt;@palver7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The issue was caused by a missing comma between two option names ,  for the namespace param.  It is fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/pull/741&gt;#741&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Thank you for telling me this. I inserted the comma as you said and it fixed the problem. Closing this issue now.
