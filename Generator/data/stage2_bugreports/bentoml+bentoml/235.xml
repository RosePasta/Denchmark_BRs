	<summary>AWS Lambda Deployment: Internal Server Error: No module named BentoML</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Running through the Scikit-learn demo "IrisClassifier" and deploying to AWS Lambda. The deployment is a success and it shows in the Functions dashboard in AWS. But using Postman to test it returns an internal server error, and using the online test evens in AWS Lambda I can see the error message: "Unable to import module 'handler': No module named 'bentoml'",
To Reproduce
Installation of BentoML 0.3.1 /Serverless 1.48.4 is done on macOS Mojave Python 3.7
Running IrisClassifer demo in quick-start-guide
Expected behavior
Running the quick-start-guide successfully

Environment:

OS: MacOS 10.14.
Python/BentoML Version [Python 3.7.3, BentoML-0.3.1]

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Mu7ammad&gt;@Mu7ammad&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you for reporting.
I looked into this issue.  It is an issue with the way we set our env parameters.
The way to use it is as of now is located at this example notebook &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/master/examples/deploy-with-serverless/deploy-with-serverless.ipynb&gt;Deploy with Serverless&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Since you brought up this to our attention, we have improved this and made it more explicit to define environments. In the next release, you can use the pip_dependencies parameter along with others.
@env(pip_dependencies=['numpy', 'pandas', '...'])
class MyService(BentoService)
	....
Let me know how it goes.  I will close this issue and feel free to reopen or comment if you have other questions.
Thanks for reporting!

		Follow up: So I tried version 0.3.4 with same example and environment, and it indeed seems to package the dependencies this time, but then when I run the lambda function I get internal server error, and from the logs it says:
"Error creating bentoml home dir '/home/sbx_user1051/bentoml': No such file or directory"
It's thrown from executing: bentoml/config/init.py , line 61 with exception: "Error creating bentoml home dir"
It seems can't find the home directory in the sandbox, so what do you think the reason for that?
Thanks

  thanks for reporting this, looks like it's an issue related to our new config implementation and limited disk access in AWS lambda environment &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html&gt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  - I will work on a fix
