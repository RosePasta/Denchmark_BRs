	<summary>Error in "bentoml serve" on Windows 10 for Model/Service stored on S3 (Minio)</summary>
	<description>
"bentoml serve" errors on Windows if Model/Service is stored on S3 (Minio)
Environment:
OS: Windows 10

python --version
Python 3.8.3

bentoml --version
bentoml, version 0.8.4
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Startup a standalone yatai-service pointing to Minio

bentoml yatai-service-start --repo-base-url s3://... --s3-endpoint-url https://...

Make sure bentoml config reflects the correct yatai_service url

bentoml config set yatai_service.url=127.0.0.1:50051`

Save Service/Model into Model Repository (It gets saved without issues)

service.save()

Serve Model/Service:

bentoml serve --verbose --debug Service:latest

PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpllrrf001\\Service\\Service\\artifacts\\model.pkl'

NotADirectoryError: [WinError 267] The directory name is invalid: 'C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpllrrf001\\Service\\Service\\artifacts\\model.pkl'

I can confirm that the Model/Service was downloaded correctly - because when I run "bentoml serve" directly from the downloaded temp directory - It works

The following works:
bentoml serve C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpllrrf001\\Service\\Service

 apology for the delayed response.
I am able to reproduce this issue with 0.8.5 as well.  I am looking into this.
Right now, you can do this workaround:
# bentoml will download the BentoService to the target directory
$ bentoml retrieve Service:latest --target_dir my_temp_dir
# Serve BentoService from the downloaded directory
$ bentoml serve my_temp_dir
