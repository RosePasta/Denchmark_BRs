	<summary>API server show blank index page</summary>
	<description>
This is an issue introduced in 0.8.4, first reported in the #bentoml-users slack channel:
Bo Han: hi there! new user here, bento-ml looks really cool, esp how it compartmentalizes ml deployment
Going through the get-started guides. i noticed that the latest release 0.8.4 is causing swagger-ui to 404 on default (0.8.3 doesn't have this issue, maybe something related to custom-ui)
steps to reproduce:
follow get started guide to bentoml serve IrisClassifier:latest
open &lt;denchmark-link:http://127.0.0.1:5000/&gt;http://127.0.0.1:5000/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

issue: blank page, w/ errors for missing swagger-ui

Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Korusuke&gt;@Korusuke&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for submitting the fix:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/pull/975&gt;#975&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We are planning to release a new version including this fix very soon.
