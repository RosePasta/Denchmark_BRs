	<description>
Describe the bug
When save a new BentoService bundle to s3, the follow error occurs
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', BrokenPipeError(32, 'Broken pipe'))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
Specify an s3 location to save BentoService bundle:
bento_service.save("s3://...")
Or run a s3 backed YataiService gRPC server:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 50051:50051 \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...  \
    bentoml/yatai-service:0.7.2 \
    --db-url postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/bentomldb \

		The issue is due to the latency for s3 to setup global DNS for S3 bucket. This happens when using a newly created S3 Bucket.
The reason behind it is that BentoML uses a pre-signed S3 URL for upload so that each data scientist does not need to configure AWS credentials, only the YataiService has the credentials. But on the AWS side, until a newly created bucket's global DNS gets set up, the pre-signed URLs generated with return a redirect and fail CORS.
If you are seeing this issue, we recommend waiting until the global DNS is set up for the s3 bucket on the AWS side(it may take a few hours).
