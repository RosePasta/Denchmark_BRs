I don't suppose you've come across the this error which crops up when running the following cells. I've been trying to adapt the Fastai Pets classification notebook to a regression problem where the model outputs a Fastai ImagePoints object.

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HenryDashwood&gt;@HenryDashwood&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it looks like an issue with BentoML and the &lt;denchmark-link:https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/&gt;click&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 package. BentoML currently does not specify a version requirement for click and I think you might have an older version of click installed. Could you try  and try again? I will do some investigation and add a minimum version requirement for click on the BentoML side.
If you still see the error, would be great if you could share your python version, BentoML version, and pip freeze output.

		Great to know! Thanks again for reporting the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HenryDashwood&gt;@HenryDashwood&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I will follow up with a PR that enforces a minimum click version check.
