	<summary>serve_gunicorn is now called with the `bento` param and not `bundle_path`</summary>
	<description>

bundle_path is still passed to serve_gunicorn as a kwarg and now breaks as it is an unexpected parameter.  the bundle_path param needs to be switched the new new  param as changed in the commit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/commit/abfd77cc327c9d205ccbe34c6cb2fe3762cd4502&gt;abfd77c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

to avoid an unexpected parameter exception.  I am not confident in where along the dependency chain to make that alteration as to not affect the other severing/cli modes.

 thanks for reporting the bug!
Passing bundle_path to server/gunicorn_serve should still work, we made it backward compatible by design. This error was due to the naming of the parameter was wrong, a bug introduced in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/commit/abfd77cc327c9d205ccbe34c6cb2fe3762cd4502&gt;abfd77c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We are working on a fix now.

 Submitted a PR fixing the issue here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/pull/500&gt;#500&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Since this bug breaks the docker API server run, we will follow up with a minor release 0.6.1 to include this bug fix. Thanks again for reporting the issue.
