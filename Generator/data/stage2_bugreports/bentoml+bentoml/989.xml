Describe the bug
When I use the cli with serve-gunicorn --enable-microbatch I got:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/spawn.py", line 116, in spawn_main

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
use the option --enable-microbatch with the cli:
bentoml serve-gunicorn --enable-microbatch myservice
Environment:

MacOS 10.15.6
Python 3.8.2, BentoML-0.8.5, gunicorn 20.0.4

 Thank you for reporting.  I can reproduce it locally and I am looking into this.

		This is a bug under extreme conditions, which needs to be met at the same time:

Use multiprocessing to start the gunicorn application.
Python &gt;= 3.8
The platform is MacOS

Reference:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods
https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/20.0.4/gunicorn/config.py#L54 (which actually caused the RecursionError)

		More details:
For MacOS, before Python3.8, the multiprocessing module starts new processes in fork mode by default, and starts new processes in spawn mode by default since 3.8.
The latter will use pickle to pass objects between processes.
And because of the use of  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/20.0.4/gunicorn/config.py#L54&gt;https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/20.0.4/gunicorn/config.py#L54&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the magic methods  and  required by pickle to reconstruct the Config object was covered, Which in turn caused the RecursionError.
