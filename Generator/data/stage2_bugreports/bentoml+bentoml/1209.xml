	<summary>Cannot delete bento that was created with same name:version as an older (deleted) bento</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
After deleting a bento, I cannot delete another bento that was created with that same name:version.
To Reproduce

Create a bento with name:1 through model_service.save(version='1').
In a shell, bentoml delete name:1
Create a new bento with the same name, again with  model_service.save(version='1').
Try to bentoml delete name:1

The error is the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Are you sure about delete name:1? This will delete the BentoService saved bundle files permanently [y/N]: y                                                                                                                                            
[2020-10-27 15:22:33,477] ERROR - RPC ERROR DangerouslyDeleteBento: Multiple rows were found for one()                                                                                                                                                    
Error: bentoml-cli delete failed: INTERNAL:Multiple rows were found for one() 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
I can endlessly delete and recreate bentos with the same name/version for testing.
Environment:

OS: Ubuntu 20.04
Python 3.8.5
BentoML Version 0.9.2
