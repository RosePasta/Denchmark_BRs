	<summary>Running wrong BentoML service when accessing it as API</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I am creating and saving multiple bento services and trying to access it as API service, the name of the bento service present on top of the screen is wrong. Each time I change the service and runs a new one, the name is not being updated. There might be two possibilities: -

Either the name displayed is wrong.
The service running is also not updated and it's running the old service.
