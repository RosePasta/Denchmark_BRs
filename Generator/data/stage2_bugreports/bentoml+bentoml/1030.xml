	<summary>bentoml serve fails with error is built / packaged on Windows and deployed on Linux</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
bentoml serve fails with error:
Error: bentoml-cli serve failed: Can not locate module_file &lt;some_dir1&gt;\&lt;some_dir2&gt;\&lt;some_file&gt;.py in saved bundle /&lt;some_dir3&gt; 
This happens because of the windows style backslash in &lt;some_dir1&gt; \ &lt;some_dir2&gt; \ &lt;some_file&gt;.py being considered as the escape character on linux.
The "&lt;some_dir1&gt; \ &lt;some_dir2&gt; \ &lt;some_file&gt;.py" originates from metadata['module_file'] in bentoml.yml
To Reproduce

Build Bento on Windows
Deploy Bento on RHEL Docker Image
Startup Fails

Environment:

Python 3.8, BentoML-0.8.4

Additional context
Can't say for sure - but my guess is that this only happens when the Bento is built/packaged on Windows and deployed on Linux.
I was able to fix this by manually replacing the forward slash with backward slash in betoml.yml

 Thank you for finding this issue.  You are exactly right. BentoML didn't take into account of module_file from Windows.
We need to improve our Windows support.  Thank you for discovering all of these issues and help BentoML improve!
