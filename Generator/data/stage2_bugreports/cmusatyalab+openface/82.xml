	<summary>Web demo: Bug when labeling with radio buttons</summary>

Install the latest docker version:
docker pull bamos/openface


Launch the docker as bash (regular launch didn't work for me, complaining it can't find th):
docker run -t -i -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 bamos/openface /bin/bash


Click train to start training


Stop training after 7-10 images


Add a name


Click in trained faces list on the added name radio button to assign name to face


Demo crashes with:
2016-01-21 20:51:46+0000 [-] /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/cross_validation.py:417: exceptions.Warning: The least populated class in y has only 1 members, which is too few. The minimum number of labels for any class cannot be less than n_folds=5.
2016-01-21 20:51:46+0000 [OpenFaceServerProtocol,0,192.168.253.221] Unhandled Error

exceptions.ValueError: The number of classes has to be greater than one; got 1



By the way, if I follow the demo youtube video usage flow (first creating a name then training), it works fine.

		Hello ,
This is because SVM by default is multiclase and as the error says you are trying to train only one class.
See official documentation. &lt;denchmark-link:http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html&gt;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In a nutshell you try to train a model with only one person.
If for some reason, so you need, I can think of a dirty trick.
Creates 2 folders one with data of the person to identify and another with data that you will call unknown.
I apologize for my English, I do not speak it natively.
