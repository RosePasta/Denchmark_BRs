	<summary>Simple Quantization aware training (TF Tutorial) throws a warning</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): colab
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): 2.2
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source):

Command used to run the converter or code if youâ€™re using the Python API
If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/model-optimization/blob/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/g3doc/guide/quantization/training_example.ipynb&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/model-optimization/blob/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/g3doc/guide/quantization/training_example.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The output from the converter invocation
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py:465: set_learning_phase (from tensorflow.python.keras.backend) is deprecated and will be removed after 2020-10-11.
Instructions for updating:
Simply pass a True/False value to the `training` argument of the `__call__` method of your layer or model.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/training/tracking/tracking.py:105: Model.state_updates (from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.training) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This property should not be used in TensorFlow 2.0, as updates are applied automatically.
INFO:tensorflow:Assets written to: /tmp/tmpjvd7obgu/assets
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Failure details
There is no failure as such. But there is a warning which is not clear to any common user. It would be helpful if the warning guides the user to root-cause of the issue so that user will update training argument.
Any other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		I have also on TensorFlow 2.2 with Linux 18.04 and trying transfer learning with a config file. I got the same warning and the process just stopped but not terminating.

 As this issue is related to a warning that we print in the console, it should ideally not cause issues when training a model. Please file a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;New issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with more details.
