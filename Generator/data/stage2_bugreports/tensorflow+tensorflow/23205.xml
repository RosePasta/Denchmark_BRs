		When I use RNN, I cannot find the source code of static_rnn function.
The below is the reason :
Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/nn/init.py has something wrong
This file is one of the tensorflow-gpu library .
And the reason is wrong package .

wrong

from tensorflow.python.ops.nn import static_rnn  

right

from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn import static_rnn

		You can write a program like below and try to view the source code of static_rnn
import tensorflow as tf
x=tf.nn.static_rnn()
