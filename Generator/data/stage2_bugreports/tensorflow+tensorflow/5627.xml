	<summary>Documentation change for 'Adding a new op ShapeFn'</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/7f3d8e1f8736f4c812e4a0a96154af3bd3750180/tensorflow/g3doc/how_tos/adding_an_op/index.md&gt;Adding a new Op&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 there is the following line of code that describes how to set the shape function:
@tf.RegisterShape("ZeroOut")(common_shapes.call_cpp_shape_fn)
I think this is wrong (you do not want the @ sign since it's not being used as a decorator). Also, having an explicit import would be helpful.
So it would be nice to change this to:
from tensorflow.python.framework import common_shapes
tf.RegisterShape("ZeroOut")(common_shapes.call_cpp_shape_fn)

		We can just remove the line now -- by default all ops call their CPP shape function.  (Or at least, they will with the next push).
