	<summary>MKL inference numbers are incorrect</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide#comparing_compiler_optimizations&gt;Performance Guide -&gt; Comparing Compiler Optimizations&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the numbers shared for inference on InceptionV3 and ResNet-50 models are exactly the same.
I'm assuming this is incorrect?

		You are correct.  In my effort to format them I must have copied and
pasted.  I will update and get someone to publish it again.  Thank you.

 I want to add I am really sorry about that.  I know it seems crazy as how can a person copy the numbers wrong.  The review process to rework the guide was so long I think I just lost focus.  I will post the fresh numbers here incase you are interested and update the guide ASAP, likely this weekend but it will take a few days for someone to do the publish part.

		The data you are seeing is InceptionV3 copied twice as an FYI until I get it fixed.

 - Thanks for the reply. I definitely understand that everyone can and will make mistakes. :)
I really appreciate the great documentation and work TensorFlowers like you have brought to the community.

Sorry about that and here are the updated numbers.  I also had some slightly newer numbers for inception3.  No real difference as a glance but I reran the numbers and did not update the document before I published.  Thank you for understanding.  It might take a little bit to update the site but you have the numbers here for now.  Sorry about the tables we have a slightly different Mark Down engine for the website.

		with 1.4.  It is so hard to publish content to the website I usually give up unless it is urgent.  The easy solution is to wait for a release.  So when 1.4 becomes root the fix will show up.  So roughly 30+ days after I fixed the content.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gunan&gt;@gunan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Master is still there if you go to versions.  The problem is master is not
updated by any type of job so it is really only updated when an rc
happens.  In a normal world I would have updated the content, waited MAYBE
1 week verified it and marked this issue closed.  This is not related to
Gunhan at all.

		Feels like a life time.  Numbers are now on the default page due to 1.4 launching.  Closing and having a personal party and a bit sip of diet cherry coke.  cheers.
