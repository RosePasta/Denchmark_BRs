	<summary>TensorFlow Lite image_segmentation example for iOS doesn't build</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The README must be provided with an explanation of how to change the settings of the project. At the moment I have problems adjusting the development team ("Signing").
Error message: No profile for team 'Rob De Putter (Personal Team)' matching 'Wildcard' found: Xcode couldn't find any provisioning profiles matching 'GPC87JXMXD/Wildcard'. Install the profile (by dragging and dropping it onto Xcode's dock item) or select a different one in the Signing &amp; Capabilities tab of the target editor.

		Could you check if the  provisioning profile that you're using contains your Development Team identity correctly? This article might help:
