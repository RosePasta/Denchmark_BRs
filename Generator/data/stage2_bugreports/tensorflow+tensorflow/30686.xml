	<summary>`tf.reduce_*` called on the result of `tf.TensorArray.concat` of unknown rank return corrupted Tensor</summary>
	<description>
System information

TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0
Python version: 3

Describe the current behavior
See the reproducing code. When tf.reduce_mean is called on the output of a TensorArray.concat which had a fully dynamic shape (including rank), it produces a Tensor of scalar shape, but whose value is a 1-element vector.
Describe the expected behavior
The resulting Tensor should have a scalar value, consistent with its static shape.
Code to reproduce the issue
Note that the bug does not reproduce if the unknown-shape Tensor is passed directly to reduce_mean, which would suggest some interaction between the two.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np

def unknown_shape_constant(val):
  # This is one way to create tensors of unknown shape.
  return tf.py_function(lambda: np.array(val), (), tf.int32)

@tf.function
def reduce_mean_bug():
  arr = tf.TensorArray(tf.int32, size=1, dynamic_size=True)
  arr = arr.write(0, unknown_shape_constant([[1], [3]]))
  c = arr.concat()
  m1 = tf.reduce_mean(c)

  arr = tf.TensorArray(tf.int32, size=1, dynamic_size=True)
  arr = arr.write(0, tf.constant([[1], [3]]))
  c = arr.concat()
  m2 = tf.reduce_mean(c)

  return m1, m2

m1, m2 = reduce_mean_bug()
assert m1.shape == m2.shape  # Fails
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		It has been 14 days with no activity and the awaiting response label was assigned. Is this still an issue?
