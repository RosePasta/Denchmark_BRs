Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google colab env
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): !pip3 install -U tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0-alpha0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: no GPU used

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
"loss becoming 'nan' and accuracy dropping to 5% using tf.keras, with fashion-mnist, on 4th epoch (sometimes it happens on 7th / 8th epoch)
"loss should not become 'nan' and accuracy should never drop unexpectedly
Print output :

As you see, accuracy is increasing each epoch. you could increase accuracy by following other tutorials on performance. Thanks

		I got this on 8th epoch last time. I hv attached jupyter notebook also, it
is happening randomly at diff epochs. pls see my log here

There is something wrong here, loss shd never become nan, never seen this
in keras or Tf 1.x

Thanks

Could you try running in other system or "reset all runtimes" in google colab and run it. Thanks!

		As I mentioned, its not a reproducible issue, i got it initially on 7th
epoch, then didnt get it for a while, again got it twice today morning on
4th epoch. I generally reset all runtimes, its kind of mandatory for me as
I install fresh version of TF and need to make sure this is happpening
properly ! I understand its not coming now, for me too it was working
yesterday, but an issue all the while, as I didnt make a single code change
in this time. and its the same env as well...Thanks

		Ran just now, after doing 'reset all runtimes' , installing tensorflow now
getting loss = nan on 3rd epoch :

 Let's investigate this one further. There might be an environment/device specific issue.
