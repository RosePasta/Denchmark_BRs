	<summary>Setting up TensorFlow for development affects subsequent `bazel test` runs</summary>
	<description>
After following instructions in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#setting-up-tensorflow-for-development&gt;Setting up TensorFlow for development&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,  will look in  before looking in  directory.
The result is that some tests may fail which would otherwise pass in a hermetic requirement. Also it could mean that some tests would pass which would otherwise fail in a hermetic environment. A work-around is to remove _python_build directory before running bazel test
Breaking into debugger while running test, I see following in sys.path, which confirms that _python_build is placed before .runfiles

		That is very sad. The dev setup is in effect a hack, I guess we've been caught. It is probably enough to add a warning about the test issue to the dev environment setup instructions?
