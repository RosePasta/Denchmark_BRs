OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Ubuntu 18.04

GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"


Cannot able to import the resnet 50 model from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/eager/benchmarks/resnet50/resnet50.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/eager/benchmarks/resnet50/resnet50.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


I want to use the above resnet50 model and not the tf.keras.applications.ResNet50 for the intermediate outputs

import tensorflow as tf
from tf.python.eager.benchmarks #not working
