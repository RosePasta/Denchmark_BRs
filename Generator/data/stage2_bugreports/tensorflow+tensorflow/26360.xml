System information

TensorFlow version: 1.12
Doc Link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.12/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/opt/AdamWOptimizer
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/opt/python/training/weight_decay_optimizers.py

Describe the documentation issue
In MomentumWOptimizer, AdamWOptimizer and DecoupledWeightDecayExtension the documentation refers to extend_with_weight_decay:
  extend_with_weight_decay(tf.train.MomentumOptimizer,
                           weight_decay=weight_decay)
AFAIK there is no "extend_with_weight_decay", only "extend_with_decoupled_weight_decay", which seems to serve a similar purpose:
MyAdamW = extend_with_decoupled_weight_decay(tf.train.AdamOptimizer)
  # Create a MyAdamW object
  optimizer = MyAdamW(weight_decay=0.001, learning_rate=0.001)
Is my understanding correct?
I could submit a PR if necessary

		You are right, it should be extend_with_decoupled_weight_decay.
Would be great if you can create a PR to fix this issue. Thanks!

 Thanks for finding this issue! I'm currently moving these optimizers into addons (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/164&gt;tensorflow/addons#164&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), I've fixed documentation there. Thanks again!
