Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: n/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.14
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: no GPU, 32 GB ram

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
I receive an assertion error when creating a forward pass for an unrolled multi-layer LSTM while using a mask.
Describe the expected behavior
No assertion error, or at least a better explanation as to the cause.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf

inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (3,4,5))
mask = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, (3,4))

single_cells = [tf.keras.layer.LSTMCell(10) for _ in range(3)]
multi_cell = tf.keras.layers.StackedRNNCell(cells=single_cells)
lstm = tf.keras.layers.RNN(cell=multi_cell, unroll=True)
output, state = lstm(inputs=inputs, mask=mask)  # &lt;- assertion error occurs here
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

I tried in colab with TF version 1.14 and 1.15.0-rc0 and i am getting the below error . I am attaching the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/9603c7f3d9814aa73513ef4db56f94b0/untitled193.ipynb&gt;gist &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
for your reference. Thanks!

		Sorry I have a typo in my code, try this instead
import tensorflow as tf

inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (3,4,5))
mask = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, (3,4))

single_cells = [tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(10) for _ in range(3)]
multi_cell = tf.keras.layers.StackedRNNCells(cells=single_cells)
lstm = tf.keras.layers.RNN(cell=multi_cell, unroll=True)
output, state = lstm(inputs=inputs, mask=mask)  # &lt;- assertion error occurs here
