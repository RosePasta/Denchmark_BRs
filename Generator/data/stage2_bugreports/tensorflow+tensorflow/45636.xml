	<summary>tf.enable_eager_execution() not working</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: cuDNN 7.6.5
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA GTX 1050

Describe the current behavior
I am trying to use the function tensor.numpy(), which requires eager_excecution to be enabled. I checked online, and it said that Tensorflow 2.0 has eager_execution enabled by default. However, when I run print(tf.executing_eagerly()) the output is False
I have tried the tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution() function, but it does not seem to change anything
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()
print(tf.executing_eagerly())

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It is working on colab, but not on my system. Is it because of some installation issue?

 Did you pass  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/29573&gt;--config=v2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 flag while building from source?

No actually I had installed tensorflow via pip, in an anaconda environment.

		Yes it still doesn't work. I tried reinstalling Tensorflow but the issue persists.
Any update on this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Saduf2019&gt;@Saduf2019&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?

 I just tried on my  desktop and don't see any issue there. I have exactly same TF version as you. You don't need . It is difficult to test why it is working wrongly for you. I guess it is more related to windows-10 and not related to TF.
Can you please try
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
#tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()
print(tf.executing_eagerly())
tf.__version__()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The issue was being replicated on Linux as well, but reinstalling Tensorflow, CuDNN &amp; CudaToolKit's older versions fixed it.
