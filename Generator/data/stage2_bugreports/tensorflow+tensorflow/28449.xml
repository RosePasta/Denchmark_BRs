	<summary>Typo in TensorFlow For Poets</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Existing URLs containing the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#3&gt;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Typo
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;MobileNet is a a small efficient convolutional neural network.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

should be
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;MobileNet is a small efficient convolutional neural network.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit PR?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I couldn't find the source for this codelab to fix the error. Is this tutorial obsolete or has it been updated for TensorFlow 2.0?
The issue has also been reported &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/issues/67&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I'm not sure about the TenforFlow website, but the CodeLab link is referenced here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSKfRcEDGUs&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSKfRcEDGUs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The video mentions the link to the CodeLab:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://goo.gl/QTwZ3v&gt;https://goo.gl/QTwZ3v&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I can now see that this CodeLab has been deprecated and an alternate TF 2.0 Notebook has been provided for the same. However, I feel that the original link is more intuitive and explains the process in a more beginner-friendly way. The original article should be re-written to be TF 2.0 compatible instead of just providing a Colab Notebook with minimal text-based explanations.

		THis has been deprecated. Please see this page for the replacements (&lt;denchmark-link:https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0&gt;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
