System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04, macOS 10.14.6
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: NA
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.1.0-rc2-17-ge5bf8de 2.1.0

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
tf.linalg.svd segfaults when input shape has at least one element being 0.
Also tested on the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cmER2YqlgwtXANSi8YbYW8TtEnt7wSPt?usp=sharing&gt;tf-2.2.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in Colab, and segfault still exists.

Should not segfault.

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.linalg.svd(np.random.rand(2, 0)) # segfault
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		I am able to reproduce the issue. This doesn't segfault when numpy's svd was used as follows
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;np.linalg.svd(np.random.rand(2, 0))
# output 
(array([[1., 0.],
        [0., 1.]]),
 array([], dtype=float64),
 array([], shape=(0, 0), dtype=float64))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
