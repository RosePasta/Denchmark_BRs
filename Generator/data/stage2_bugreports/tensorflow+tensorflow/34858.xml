&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;




tensorflow/tensorflow/python/keras/losses.py


         Line 493
      in
      1cf0898






     [[.9, .05, .05], [.5, .89, .6], [.05, .01, .94]]) 





&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Entries [1,0] and [1,2] of a tensor linked to should be 10 times smaller in order for the second entry to sum up to 1.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are you planning to also submit a pull request to fix the issue?
No, the change seems too small for an expensive TF CI to run.
