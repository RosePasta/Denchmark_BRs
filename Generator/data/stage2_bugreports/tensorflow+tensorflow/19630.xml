	<summary>Possible Error in "TensorFlow For Poets" Guide</summary>
	<description>
Small, possible error found in &lt;denchmark-link:https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#4&gt;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
"The first figure shows accuracy (x-axis) as a function of training progress (y-axis):"
Should be corrected to:
"The first figure shows accuracy (y-axis) as a function of training progress (x-axis):"
Or you can change the "accuracy_1" graph below it.

		Cool, np. There are also some minor spelling errors on   &lt;denchmark-link:https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#5&gt;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
   (in the yellow box):



"WIf you chose a mobilenet that takes a smaller input size, then be shure to set the   --input_size   flag using the shell variable you set earlier."



should probably be:



"**If**   you chose a mobilenet that takes a smaller input size, then be to **sure** set the   --input_size   flag using the shell variable you set earlier."



But people can probably understand it regardless. Thank you.
