	<summary>Trivial example does not save/restore weights, prints warnings from TensorFlow/Keras implementation</summary>

GitHub Policy,

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS 10.15.7, colab
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip, colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.1 (MacOS), v2.3.0-0-gb36436b087 2.3.0 (colab)
Python version: 3.8.5 (MacOS) 3.6.9 (colab)

Describe the current behavior
Trained weights are not restored, two warnings about the TensorFlow implementation are printed:
WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/training/tracking/tracking.py:111: Model.state_updates (from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.training) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Instructions for updating: This property should not be used in TensorFlow 2.0, as updates are applied automatically. WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/training/tracking/tracking.py:111: Layer.updates (from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.base_layer) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Instructions for updating: This property should not be used in TensorFlow 2.0, as updates are applied automatically.
Describe the expected behavior
Weights are restored (test accuracy is consistent with saved model), no warnings printed.
I find several closed bug reports from others over that look like the same problems  (lack of saving and the bogus warnings), going back to the 2.0.0 days. It has clearly not been fixed.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    epochs=8,
    batch_size=128,
    validation_split=0.2)

test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('model_test_acc:', test_acc)

model.save("my_saved_path")

saved_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_saved_path")

test_loss, test_acc = saved_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('saved_model_test_acc:', test_acc)

		Weights are properly restored, and those two warnings are gone, although two new deprecation warnings about the keras implementation have appeared that I hope you will have fixed/muted for 2.4.
