This plot makes it look like AUC is greater than 1.0 when it is not.

 : Can you provide any more detail that helps reproduce the problem? For example, a pointer to the logdir you use?
CCing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dandelionmane&gt;@dandelionmane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just in case he has thoughts on this.

 I cannot send you any more detail unfortunately other than the values that make up the curve just from the screenshots as the data is proprietary.

 : Sure, I just wanted to make sure that the AUC scalar being plotted is really less than 1.0 :)

		The hover text is for that point that's plotted wrong.

		I wonder if its a render issue and the 1.00 should be moved up to the next y tick.

		This looks like a rounding/precision error. The labels for 0.999 and 0.998 appear twice, so the top most label should probably also be 1.00 and so your value is between 1.00 and 1.00 :), which is ok for 0.9999 when the "real" labels are 0.995 rounded to 1.00 and 1.0 rounded to 1.00.
So everything is displayed correctly but there are not enough decimal places for the labels to see it.

I understanding the rounding error but the graph is still wrong.  There is no way one could put a plot like that in a journal.

		I agree with you. The graph is not good and I wouldn't show such a graph to anyone, this only creates confusion and questions.
What I wanted to say, there is no error in the graph (so there is nothing to fix there) but the axis labeling of the graph is confusing (so the selection of the y-axis range and decimal places should be changed).

		Please provide a dataset (or code snippet) that reproduces this and we'll dig into it. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/isaacgerg&gt;@isaacgerg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  I've moved on from this issue - sorry but its been over 3 weeks.  I no longer get the problem based on my new training scheme, the numbers have a much larger derivative.  Feel free to close if you'd like.

		If we get a repro script—even with constant data—I'd like to look into this. Until then, closing.
Please feel free to re-open on our new repository at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
