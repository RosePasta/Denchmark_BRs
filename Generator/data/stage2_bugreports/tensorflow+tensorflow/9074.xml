	<summary>Documentation: broken links and image in documentation</summary>
	<description>
The URL:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_sum&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_sum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has a broken link labelled "the section on Segmentation".  Also, there is a broken image on that page as well.
Same problems here too (except not all have an image to be broken):
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_prod&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_prod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_min&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_min&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_max&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_max&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_mean&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/segment_mean&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/unsorted_segment_sum&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/unsorted_segment_sum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_sum&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_sum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_mean&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_mean&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_sqrt_n&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/sparse_segment_sqrt_n&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The page I believe they should link back to is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_guides/python/math_ops#Segmentation&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_guides/python/math_ops#Segmentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I came here because I haven't grokked just what segmented operations are yet.  So I would be much obliged if the explanation of segmentation were more thoroughly be explained there, perhaps with a couple of examples.
I found [a few places] in the code where this could be address.  And I would have attempted a pull request to fix these, but I'm not up on how to generate the documentation to verify that it was fixed.

		Thanks for the report, the documentation is indeed broken. Looking into a fix.
As a workaround in the mean time, you can see the images at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/images/SegmentProd.png&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/images/SegmentProd.png&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 etc.

		While you're at it, I noticed that on the unsorted_segment_sum page, it refers to perhaps an older naming scheme:
"Unlike SegmentSum, segment_ids need not be sorted and need not cover all values in the full range of valid values."
