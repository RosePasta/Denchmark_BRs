	<summary>loading pre-trained resnet-50 for Object Detection Models on TensorFlow 2.0</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi,
In the "Train a vanilla ResNet-50 based RetinaNet." it is said to use the "path to the pre-trained Resnet-50 checkpoint". There is no link to any pre-trained model.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54512903/76514447-2f331d00-6458-11ea-8d63-dd474964f22c.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried to use the resnet-50 which is in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/image_classification&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/image_classification&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 because it was likely to be a correct implementation as an official one.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54512903/76515131-5b02d280-6459-11ea-973f-aabff6078c2d.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Unfortunately, when I use :
python main.py --strategy_type=one_device --num_gpus=1 --model_dir="my_models" --mode=train --config_file="my_retinanet.yaml"
With this yaml :
type: 'retinanet'
train:
checkpoint:
path: pretrained_model\home\hongkuny\hongkuny_keras_resnet50_gpu_8_fp32_eager_graph_cfit\checkpoints
prefix: resnet50
train_file_pattern: tfrecords\train.record
eval:
eval_file_pattern: tfrecords\test.record
I got nothing load because the weight seems to be wrongly named in this file, so it is not matching.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54512903/76515306-a4532200-6459-11ea-90d7-b144b6498151.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I also tried some other models from the zoo assuming we might load weights from resnet based objects detection models but I got the same probleme.
I think we might add a link to a correct checkpoint of a compatible pre-trained model in order to avoid roaming around incompatible models.
regards,
Swann

		I have reuploaded this issue there :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/8274&gt;tensorflow/models#8274&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

because it concerns models and not tensorflow.
