	<summary>Quantized ops?</summary>
	<description>
In the data types section, there are

Found a note here:



tensorflow/tensorflow/cc/ops/const_op.h


         Line 65

 // TODO(josh11b): Support other types (e.g. quantized ints, float16). 





Can you explain what these are?

		We are working on support for operators and kernels that take quantized (fixed-point) data -- we're still working on the right APIs to expose them, and with that we'll have more documentation on why and how they are used.  Stay tuned!

		Closing for now. When the quantized ops come online, they'll come with documentation.

 Any news on fixed-point / quantized data type support?
I am designing an FPGA-based accelerator for CNNs as my master thesis in the next few months. It would be awesome to be able to train the models with fixed-point weights and activations.
Do you have any roadmap for fixed-point support?

 have you find the answer?

 could you please reopen, point to the correct doc, or confirm that is still should be considered internal (though it is exposed in many place by now)
