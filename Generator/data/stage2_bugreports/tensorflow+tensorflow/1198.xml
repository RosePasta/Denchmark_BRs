	<summary>reverse_sequence's inability to accept int32 can break bidirectional_rnn</summary>
	<description>
In the latest releases bidirectional_rnn has been changed to accept int32 tensors for the sequence_length argument, but tf.reverse_sequence only accepts int64 tensors, and this is currently causing an error when an int32 tensor is passed to bidirectional_rnn.
