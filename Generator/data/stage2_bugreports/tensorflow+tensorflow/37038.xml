	<summary>UnsatisfiedLinkError on nightly build of tensorflow-lite</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Mobile device: Android
TensorFlow installed from: Gradle (jcenter)


On sample project, we ran into UnsatisfiedLinkError "/lib/arm64/libtensorflowlite_gpu_jni.so" using nightly build. If we switch to 2.1.0 that doesn't have the problem.
On Android guide to tensorflow-lite it also suggest to use nightly build, and I don't think this is good for production builds.

Describe the expected behavior
Doesn't run into UnsatisfiedLinkError at runtime.

I have the same problem, couldn't find any soultion yet. It comes up when I try to create a new GPU delegate.

You can just use "org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.1.0" and "org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu:2.1.0", nightly build will break.

		Odd, I haven't been able to repro. Can you try &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23025433/how-to-clear-gradle-cache&gt;clearing your gradle cache&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and rebulding? Also, what device are you using to test?
I successfully built and deployed using:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd examples/lite/examples/image_classification/android
./gradlew cleanBuildCache
./gradlew build
adb install -r -d  ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Also note that the GPU and base TFLite dependencies must have matching versions, i.e.,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:0.0.0-nightly'
    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu:0.0.0-nightly'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

or
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.1.0'
    implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu:2.1.0'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I guess this is the same as issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/37161&gt;#37161&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. And it's addressed by PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/37033&gt;#37033&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
