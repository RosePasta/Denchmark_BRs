	<summary>Slim namespace has non-slim symbols</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/754048a0453a04a761e112ae5d99c149eb9910dd/tensorflow/contrib/slim/__init__.py&gt;tensorflow/contrib/slim/init.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 makes symbols from unrelated namespaces available in its own.
from tensorflow.contrib.framework.python.ops.arg_scope import *
from tensorflow.contrib.framework.python.ops.variables import *
from tensorflow.contrib.layers.python.layers import *
from tensorflow.contrib.layers.python.layers.initializers import *
from tensorflow.contrib.layers.python.layers.regularizers import *
This makes it difficult for users to reference names canonically. For example &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4887&gt;#4887&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where a user said  instead of .
We almost certainly want to refactor this namespace so it only exports symbols belonging to slim.

		The documents need to be updated as well.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;   # inputs has shape [batch, 224, 224, 3]
   with slim.arg_scope(resnet_v2.resnet_arg_scope(is_training)):
      net, end_points = resnet_v2.resnet_v2_101(inputs, 1000)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		So all those symbols actually belonged initially to slim so users of slim want to keep been able to access them in an unify way, so not sure how to solve this.

		I think we may mark it as deprecated and refactor current code to use ? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sguada&gt;@sguada&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We can just create functions in that init file that log a warning and delegate to the actual function. Then in v1.o we remove the delegates. We'll need to refactor the internal codebase after the deprecation is added.

		This is something that should be done, but we probably don't have time right now and I'd like to clean out this issue.
