	<summary>[TF 2.0 API Docs] tf.autograph.to_code</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/autograph/to_code&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/autograph/to_code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Initial description could be clearer, instead of referring to another function as similar (to_graph), restate primary use case:

From: “Similar to to_graph, but returns Python source code as a string.”
To: “to_code is a low-level API that returns the AutoGraph generated Python source code as a string. This is similar to to_graph, which returns the TensorFlow graph, instead of Python.”

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Usage example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No usage example in docs, only references to guides/example, would suggest uplifting an example from a guide to the docs for completeness (ref &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/autograph&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/autograph&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Yes
