	<summary>strided_slice leads to unknown shape for Input layer</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):

conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.0-alpha

Python version:
3.7.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
not relevent
GPU model and memory:
not relevent

Describe the current behavior
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input

with tf.device('/cpu:0'):
    t = Input((2, 3, 4), batch_size=1)
    output = tf.strided_slice(t, [0, 0, 0, 0], [-1, -1, -1, 2])
    print(output.shape)
Output is &lt;unknown&gt;
Describe the expected behavior
strided_slice should calculate the shape of the output tensor correctly.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

 Thanks for trying TF 2.0 alpha. I was able to reproduce the observed behavior. Executing the same snippet in TF 2.0 cpu version returns correct results.

		This is fixed with latest TF 2.0 Nightly. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/c499ffa64c5c541e31a81c876c83fbd9/tf27649.ipynb#scrollTo=wZkzcfDM3TCh&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
