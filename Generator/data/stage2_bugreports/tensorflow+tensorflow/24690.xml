	<summary>tf.keras.backend.batch_normalization documentation equation does not match implementation</summary>
	<description>
System information

TensorFlow version: r1.12
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/backend/batch_normalization

Describe the documentation issue
The documentation describes the op as computing
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;output = (x - mean) / (sqrt(var) + epsilon) * gamma + beta
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the op actually computes
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;output = (x - mean) / (sqrt(var + epsilon)) * gamma + beta
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

with epsilon inside the sqrt
Practically, it doesn't really matter where the epsilon is added in actual use.  (I only noticed because I was comparing the output of each layer when translating something from caffe to tensorflow)
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
Maybe eventually, would take me awhile to get around to it
