	<summary>MaskRCNN TensorFlow Lite Inference Issue. No output from TFLite Model.</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution ( Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-1034-azure x86_64)):
TensorFlow installed from (source- Pip Install):
TensorFlow version (2.3.0):

Command used to run the converter
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(keras_model)
converter.allow_custom_ops = True
converter.experimental_new_converter = True
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [
    tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS, # enable TensorFlow Lite ops.
    tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS # enable TensorFlow ops.
]

converter.optimizations = [ tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT ]

tflite_model = converter.convert()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

link to Jupyter notebook and tflite model
&lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pTB33fTSo5ENzevobTvuG7hN4YmiCPF_?usp=sharing&gt;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pTB33fTSo5ENzevobTvuG7hN4YmiCPF_?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Commands used for inference
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;### Load the TFLite model and allocate tensors.
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="model_2.3.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

### Get input and output tensors.
input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

### Test the model on random input data.
input_data_1 = np.array(np.random.random_sample(input_details[0]['shape']), dtype=np.float32)
input_data_2 = np.array(np.random.random_sample(input_details[1]['shape']), dtype=np.float32)
input_data_3 = np.array(np.random.random_sample(input_details[2]['shape']), dtype=np.float32)

interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data_1)
interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[1]['index'], input_data_2)
interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[2]['index'], input_data_3)

interpreter.invoke() ---&gt; Kernel is getting stuck here. No output. I am executing the code from jupyter.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The output from the converter invocation
No output in Jupyter.
Segmentation fault (core dumped) -- When executed in command line.
Failure details
Conversion is successful. But there is no output from model.
Could you guys please provide some ideas? I am stuck here and don't know how to proceed!

		I ran the model with tf-nightly version through the shared notebook. It took a few minutes to complete the invoke() part but I could get the result.

Hi abattery, Thanks a ton for checking the code and responding.
Have you done any modifications in the code? Are you using the same model which I shared?
I tried tf-nightly(cpu), but the system freezed and jupyter kernel died after sometime.
Did you try the GPU version? I have to change my CUDA to 11 for trying tf-nightly in gpu.
Could you please share the system details where you tried this code?

		I ran the shared model on the shared colab without any modifications after installing tf-nightly version via !pip install tf-nightly.

		I think the model is quite big and slow to run. However, the model itself is runnable.

		Thanks again. I am able to execute the code in Colab and get the results. It took a long time though(~10 minutes). I will check how to improve the inference time. Please suggest if you have any ideas.
Once again, Thank you very much for helping üëç

		If you need bounding boxes, you can check out the SSD models on the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md&gt;TF2 detection zoo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Mask-RCNN is not very well supported on TFLite, mainly because the models in the TF1 detection zoo are too large to perform well on-device.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
