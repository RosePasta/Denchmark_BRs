		This question is better asked on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged//tensorflow&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it is not a bug or feature request. There is also a larger community that reads questions there and provide faster resolution to such issues. Thanks!
