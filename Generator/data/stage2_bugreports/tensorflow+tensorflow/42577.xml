	<summary>[IOS TfLite] Missing Operations for TfLite GPU Delegate</summary>
	<description>
System information
In Podfile: TensorFlowLiteSwift', '~&gt; 0.0.1-nightly', :subspecs =&gt; ['Metal']
Tensorflow Lite version: 2.3.0
Swift 5
Xcode ver 11.6

The model file is YOLOv4-tiny, training with darknet framework, the config file similar to:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov4-tiny-custom.cfg&gt;https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov4-tiny-custom.cfg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Convert to model tflite using this following open project sourecode:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite&gt;https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

**
I'm trying to use the GPU delegate for my custom tflite model, create the interpreter with GPU delegate using this code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;var metalOptions = MetalDelegate.Options()
metalOptions.waitType = .passive
let delegate = MetalDelegate(options: metalOptions)
var options = Interpreter.Options()
options.threadCount = threadCount
interpreter = try Interpreter(modelPath: modelPath, options: options,delegates: [delegate])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After running, got this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TensorFlow Lite Error: Following operations are not supported by GPU delegate:
DEQUANTIZE: 
SPLIT: Operation is not supported.
SPLIT_V: Operation is not supported.
106 operations will run on the GPU, and the remaining 100 operations will run on the CPU
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

How can I fix this error?
Thanks.

		This actually is warning not error. It's to tell you the some ops are not delegated.
