	<summary>TensorFlow for C doesn't compile - cannot open source file "tensorflow/c/tf_attrtype.h"</summary>
	<description>
My team is requesting that we use the C API for tensorflow.
I followed the instructions outlined under "Install TensorFlow for C" (&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). However, when I attempt to compile it fails with the message:

cannot open source file "tensorflow/c/tf_attrtype.h"

I am using Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2017. The steps used for installation/compilation are as follows:

Download Windows CPU zip file
Extract to desktop folder tf-demo
C:\Users\....\Desktop\tf-demo
Start Visual Studio 2017
Create a Console application project
Incorporate Example program in Visual Studio's 'main' file/routine.
Update Project's Additional Include Directories
6.1 Right click on project
6.2 Select Properties
6.3 Expand Configuration
6.4 Expand C/C++
6.5 Select General
6.6 Select Additional Include Directories
6.7 Enter the path to the include files
C:\Users\....\Desktop\tf-demo\include
6.8 [Ok]
6.9 [Ok]
Disable precompiled Headers
7.1 Right click on project
7.2 Select Properties
7.3 Expand Cnfiguration
7.4 Expand C/C++
7.5 Select Precompiled Headers
7.6 Change "Precompiled Headers" to "Not using...."
7.7 [OK]

After this I compile and it fails with the messages
`
Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error (active)	E1696	cannot open source file "tensorflow/c/tf_attrtype.h"	DemoProg
c:\Users....\Desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow\c\c_api.h	22
Error	C1083	Cannot open include file: 'tensorflow/c/tf_attrtype.h': No such file or directory	DemoProg	c:\users....\desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow\c\c_api.h	22
`
I reviewed the contents of the tf-demo directory and there is no tf_attrtype.h anywhere in the install package.
`

		Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in the Github new issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

		System information


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows 10
Visual Studio 2017


Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
Not applicable


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Assuming it's binary. The GIT hub page did (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) not specify. Moreover, the contents of the installed material (see earlier post, did not have any source files but did have lib and dll)


TensorFlow version:
I'm not sure about the version of tensor flow. The installer has the following name:
libtensorflow-cpu-windows-x86_64-1.14.0.zip


I'm guessing it is 1.14.0?
The installer was downloaded from the github page at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that provides the instructions for installing and compiling the demo program.


Python version:
Not applicable. I am using the C version


Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?:
Windows Zip file


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
N/A


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
N/A


CUDA/cuDNN version:
N/A


GPU model and memory:
N/A this is a compile problem not a run time problem.


Describe the problem
Doesn't compile. Complains about missing header files. See original problem description for details.
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ymodak&gt;@ymodak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I get the same result with Visual Studio 2015.
I think the root cause is that the windows installation zip file does not have the file
tensorflow/c/tf_attrtype.h
The failure is that this file cannot be found, and the only header files present after the install are:
C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\tf-demo&gt;dir /b /s include
C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow
C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow\c
C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow\c\c_api.h
C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow\c\eager
C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow\c\LICENSE
C:\Users\xxxx\Desktop\tf-demo\include\tensorflow\c\eager\c_api.h

		Yes you are right tensorflow/c/tf_attrtype.h is missing in windows package.

		Download linux package, inside it copy tensorflow/c/tf_attrtype.h, then paste inside windows package. It works for me!

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cesarsalgado&gt;@cesarsalgado&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. This is a great workaround that we will use. I also look forward to the Windows installer being fixed so that it is complete.

Thank you.

 looks like some headers are missing on the windows package.

		I have solved the problem.  The windows package is complete. You have just to specify the path in the include like this
#include&lt;tensorflow/c/c_api.h&gt;
And do not include the complete path in your project properties.  just stop your path in the include folder.
Like this : $(SolutionDir)/tensorflow/include/
