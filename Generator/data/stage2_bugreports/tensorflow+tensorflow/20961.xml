Suppress warnings as below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np

import tensorflow as tf
old_v = tf.logging.get_verbosity()
tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)

from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data

mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot=True)
train_data = mnist.train.images  # Returns np.array
train_labels = np.asarray(mnist.train.labels, dtype=np.int32)
eval_data = mnist.test.images  # Returns np.array
eval_labels = np.asarray(mnist.test.labels, dtype=np.int32)

tf.logging.set_verbosity(old_v)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Thanks for sharing the workaround for tensorflowbutler. I think tensorflowbutler was updated after initial comment by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sunil1997&gt;@Sunil1997&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I am closing this due to lack of recent activity regarding the issue. Please open a new issue if the error repeats.
Please use more stable approach for mnist data
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train),(x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
