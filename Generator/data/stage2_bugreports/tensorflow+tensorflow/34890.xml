System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-16986-g6c32a22 2.1.0-dev20191029
Python version: 3.6.8


 doesn't support  as mentioned in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential#run_eagerly&gt;docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Describe the expected behaviour
Either Sequential model accepts run_eagarly as a param and changes its behaviour, or we modify the docs.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(
    layers=[tf.keras.layers.Dense(input_shape=(3, ), units=1)], 
    run_eagerly=True)
Other info / logs
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tst.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    run_eagerly=True)
  File "/home/squadrick/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/training/tracking/base.py", line 457, in _method_wrapper
    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'run_eagerly'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

,
Hello, Please try giving  as a parameter to compile it should work fine, kindly refer the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview#train_and_evaluate&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Also find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/oanush/e1262a3a58d8bf0e6bb4419b361e78d7/34890.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of colab. Let us know if it helped.Thanks!

 My issue is more to do with the incorrect documentation. I eventually figured out how to run the model, but the documentation for  is completely wrong. And for anyone wanting the same thing, they're more likely to go to the page of  than the link you posted.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Squadrick&gt;@Squadrick&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, what part of the doc is incorrect? It doesn't say it's an argument to init. But could clarify in the doc string that it should be called in compile. It would be useful to add the param to the .compile method.
Can you send a PR for &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential?version=nightly&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential?version=nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
The pages have a link "View source" to edit the docstring.

		My bad. I figured Properties meant things that could be passed to __init__. The docs are correct. I'll close this issue, thanks for the help.
