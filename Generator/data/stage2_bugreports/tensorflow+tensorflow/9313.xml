	<summary>`Evaluable` docs: name, checkpoint_path, and hooks should be new bullets.</summary>
	<description>
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/Evaluable&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/Evaluable&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - final params for evaluate() are not bullets, making reading the documentation less readable. I've seen this in other docs too (can comment if I come across more of them).
I wonder if the parser has some bug that causes it to not bullet-ify some params for functions.

		It's typically an error in the MD format, like missing spaces in front the bullet.

		Where are the instructions on how to generate the docs?
I could make this fix here and in multiple other places if I can just generate the docs to check that my changes fix things like this.

		I think the issue is the extra line in  args description in python code. PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/10423&gt;#10423&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
