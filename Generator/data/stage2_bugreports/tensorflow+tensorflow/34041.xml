	<summary>Training with TPU model.fit error, while GPU works well</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):No
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):Using Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below):v2.0.0-rc2-26-g64c3d38
Python version:3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:N/A
GPU model and memory:TPU

Describe the current behavior
Doing a transfer learning with InceptionV3 model on a medium-sized dataset (tfds, CatsVsDogs).
For the same code, when training with GPU, the code runs smoothly.
Switching to TPU produces this (And often other various) errors
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InternalError: Failed copying input tensor from /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0 to /job:worker/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0 in order to run DatasetCardinality: Unable to parse tensor proto
Additional GRPC error information:
{"created":"@1573042445.409490969","description":"Error received from peer","file":"external/grpc/src/core/lib/surface/call.cc","file_line":1039,"grpc_message":"Unable to parse tensor proto","grpc_status":3} [Op:DatasetCardinality]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
TPU training should run similarly to GPU training (without errors in this case)

Please find the Colab gist to reproduce the issue &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;"https://gist.github.com/MikeOfZen/abadf58b9c68acd1b33c6e39af7b3f7a.js"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs
*The issue occurs in both TF 1.15 and 2.0 versions.
Attempting to use .take() to provide cardinality to the dataset didn't help (I've used it successfully to solve a similar issue before)
Overall, I've gotten a number of various odd errors when trying to do TPU training.
Specifically, if caching for this dataset is enabled (should be ~25Gb) all sorts of wild errors pop up from the TPU side, probably due to OOM or buffer overflows.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MikeOfZen&gt;@MikeOfZen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, sorry for the very late response here but if you're still facing an issue please update the thread with a reproducible colab notebook since I cannot access the bucket. Thanks!
