Describe the current behavior
i tried to use tf.dataset api to build a custom dataloader, all the images are in .jpg format and rgb color space with exact 3 channels (i double checked this using opencv to load images and numpy to print image shape). then i got this error:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Cannot batch tensors with different shapes in component 0. First element had shape [270,270,3] and element 92 had shape [270,270,1].
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def load_function(image_path, label_path, crop_size=256):
        image = tf.read_file(image_path)
        image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image)
        image = tf.image.resize_images(image, [270, 270])
        image = tf.image.random_crop(image, [crop_size, crop_size, 3])
        label = tf.read_file(label_path)
        label = tf.image.decode_png(label)
        label = tf.image.resize_images(label, [270, 270])
        label = tf.image.random_crop(label, [crop_size, crop_size, 1])
        return image, label
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		What the error indicates is that the 92nd image has different shape ([270, 270, 3] vs. [270, 270, 1]) then the previous 91 images.
My recommendation would be to remove batch from your input pipeline and then iterate through your input pipeline one by one, printing out the shape and image name to identify the problematic image.
This is problem with your data, not with tf.data. (If you believe it is a problem with tf.data, please provide a reproducible example).
