		It was submitted to gerrit, but it broke the build so we had to roll it back.  So I guess this is back to 'contributions welcome' :(

		For whoever looks at this next: I fixed tf.test.compute_gradient_error a while ago to handle complex64 input, so it should be easy to test this change.

 The fact that I fixed  means that others can easily test the fix.  I'm not going to do it myself.

		Sigh ... almost three years after a issue was described, unit tests were provided and a fix was given.
Sorry, I don't have the time right now to go back and set my computer back up to verify this.  I seem to recall that it has been fixed, but I am only 95% sure of this, since it has been years.

		Closing this issue since the fix has been made.
