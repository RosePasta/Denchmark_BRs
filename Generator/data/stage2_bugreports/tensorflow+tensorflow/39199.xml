	<summary>Breaking changes related to infinite generators missing in TF 2.2 release notes</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=nightly&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have spent the better part of a working day on tracking down several infinite loops using TF 2.2.0. In summary, the following two pieces of code run fine in TF 2.1.0, and run in infinite loops in TF 2.2.0:
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Issue 1&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"""Bug 1."""
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.applications import vgg16
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

N = 9
data = ImageDataGenerator().flow(np.empty((N, 224, 224, 3)), np.empty((N, 1000)))

model = vgg16.VGG16()
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy")
model.fit(
    x=data,
    epochs=2,
    verbose=2,  # 1
    # steps_per_epoch=N,
)

# https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=nightly
# "When passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you must specify the steps_per_epoch argument."
# This is a breaking change that should be part of the release notes.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This code auto-selects steps_per_epoch=1 ("Train for 1 steps") in TF 2.1.0, which is correct (default batch_size is 32, len(train_flow) is 1). In TF 2.2.0, it's an infinite loop that is hard to debug. After setting verbose=1, one can see that something is in fact happening, with the number of steps per epoch growing without limits; from there, looking at the docs, one notices that steps_per_epoch is required ("When passing an infinitely repeating dataset, you must specify the steps_per_epoch argument."). But it's hard to recognize that breaking change from the release notes. (It's even hard to know that the ImageDataGenerator().flow() does indeed repeat infinitely, since it does have a length.)
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Issues 2 and 3&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"""Bug 2."""
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.applications import vgg16
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

N = 9
data = ImageDataGenerator().flow(np.empty((N, 224, 224, 3)), np.empty((N, 1000)))

model = vgg16.VGG16()
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="categorical_crossentropy")
model.fit(
    x=data,
    epochs=2,
    verbose=1,
    # steps_per_epoch=N,
    validation_data=data,
    ## validation_steps=N,
)

# https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=nightly
# "Note that `validation_data` does not support all the data types that are supported in `x`, eg, dict, generator [...]"
# This is a breaking change that should be part of the release notes.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Similarly, this code auto-selects steps_per_epoch=1 and validation_steps=1 ("Train for 1 steps, validate for 1 steps") in TF 2.1.0, which is correct (default batch_size is 32, len(val_flow) is 1). In TF 2.2.0, it's again an infinite loop that is hard to debug, even if one sets verbose=1 and steps_per_epoch=N (since there is no verbosity on the validation part). Again, looking at the docs, one notices that validation_steps is required ("In the case of an infinitely repeated dataset, it will run into an infinite loop."). But, again, it's hard to recognize that breaking change from the release notes. (Again, it's even hard to know that the ImageDataGenerator().flow() does indeed repeat infinitely, since it does have a length.)
Finally, the nightly docs say that "validation_data does not support all the data types that are supported in x, eg, dict, generator [...]". As you can see above, using a ImageDataGenerator still works if you adhere to the other requirements. If use of any generator is disencouraged from now on, this is a breaking change that needs to go into the release notes in my opinion.

		I am able to replicate this issue even on gpu, please find the gist of &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/02c85eb6a8a1dca5aa731be6a4512f81/nightly_gpu.ipynb&gt;nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I ran your codes in  and  and both are not any infinite loop now. Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/d181ea48127195b8d037fdeb112b13a4/nightly_gpu.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Please verify once and close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!

		This is similiar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39277&gt;#39277&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and has been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b53ed4d560aaeb7a92185f4fbf2562e5e274456a&gt;b53ed4d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The fix is available in nightly and the next TF version release will have it.
