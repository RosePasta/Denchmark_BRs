	<summary>tf.logging documentation leads to 404</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As far as I can tell all articles describing tf.logging namespace. Such as:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/logging/TaskLevelStatusMessage&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/logging/TaskLevelStatusMessage&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

or
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/logging&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/logging&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Despite showing up in search results these articles are not accessible.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Search results for logging and related queries contain links to nonexistent articles.
Leading to confusion and potentially avoidable issues.

 tf.logging doesn't exist in TF2.x. Please check &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26662#issuecomment-505913656&gt;this issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more info.
I think we need to update that page. Where did you find links to those two pages?
If someone wants to use it then import it from tf.compat.v1.logging. Thanks!
We will check this and update webpage accordingly. Thanks!

 I was looking into how logging works in Tensorflow. And if you search official docs it comes up among first results:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66251151/97800813-96e0e700-1c38-11eb-86e2-9fa00458186e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I thought it might have been coincidence so I tried to find more about the module, only to run into more 404s and that's pretty much when I decided to post this issue.

 Agree with you. I am seeing the same search results. I am not sure why those pages are picked up in the search.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MarkDaoust&gt;@MarkDaoust&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Any idea why search results are picking "404" error pages? Thanks!

		I'l often surprised how long 404s stick around in there. That's just google search.
I've submitted a request to clear out those URLs, IDK how long that will take to activate.
