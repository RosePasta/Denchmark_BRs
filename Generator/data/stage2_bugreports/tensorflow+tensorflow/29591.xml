		Could you please give some more information or fill the issue template?
Where does this link exist in the docs? (i.e. Where did you click it and realised it's broken?)

		Hi dear Anestis, Yes. I was just browsing TensorFlow docs on the link below:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


But there is a broken link in the middle of the page
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/images/models/pose_estimation.gif&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/images/models/pose_estimation.gif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


&lt;denchmark-link:#&gt;…&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I believe it is supposed to point in this &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irealva/tfjs-models/master/posenet/demos/camera.gif&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/models/pose_estimation/overview.md&gt;docs file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should be changed. We should wait for a tensorflower before opening a PR.
Would you like to submit it if that's the case?

		Thanks for the report!
That link should point here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/images/lite/models/pose_estimation.gif&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/images/lite/models/pose_estimation.gif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Would someone be able to make a PR?
