	<summary>Tensorflow Debug tfdbg ValueError with combined loss functions.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes. Included
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 Home x64, 1709
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (pip3)
TensorFlow version (use command below):  1.4.0
Python version:  3.5.2
Exact command to reproduce: See source code.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When attempting to combine two loss functions, tfdbg fails to properly grab the gradients due to a ValueError when executing run.

 Thanks for taking the time to report this issue and creating the example code for reproduction.
However, I can't reproduce the issue using your  on a GPU machine that I have. See screenshot of the successful  below:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16824702/35258674-141b22aa-ffcf-11e7-8f65-62bc792f6b27.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The tfdbg&gt; run passed 5 out of the 5 times that I ran it. This was the case for the latest nightly version of tensorflow-gpu (1.5). I didn't try 1.4 though (too painful to downgrade CUDA from 9 to 8... :p )
I wonder whether this has to do with GPU type or OS details.
Mine is a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. My OS is Ubuntu 16.04.
I haven't tried Windows, though. Maybe this is a Windows-specific issue. If you could try a Linux machine, that would be great. I can also try a Windows machine with GPU later.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/caisq&gt;@caisq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
As you indicated, when I ran it on a Linux machine (Mint), it did not run into any problems. So perhaps this is just a Windows issue. Is there anything else that I can supply that might help fish out what the culprit is?
