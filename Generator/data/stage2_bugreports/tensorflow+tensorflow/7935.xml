&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 / Windows
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: NO
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)". 1.0

If installed from source, provide NO
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.estimators import kmeans as kmeans_lib
from tensorflow.contrib.factorization.python.ops import clustering_ops
import random
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf


def input_fn(x):
"""Returns an input_fn"""
def _fn():
       return tf.constant(x), None
return _fn

x = np.array([[random.random() for i in range(198)] for j in range(2384)], dtype=np.float32)
km = kmeans_lib.KMeansClustering(num_clusters=200, initial_clusters=clustering_ops.KMEANS_PLUS_PLUS_INIT)
km.fit(input_fn=input_fn(x), max_steps=300)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What other attempted solutions have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi, I found following 2 lines missing in gen_clustering_ops.py. I believe they should there in the file. If not then please raise a bug.  I couldn't find the correct place where the change is to be made

 If I understand correctly, the problem occurs on Windows?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry&gt;@mrry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 might have some thoughts here; perhaps NearestNeighbors isn't registered correctly on Windows?

		Quite possibly! The support for unsupported libraries in tf.contrib on Windows is incomplete, and left up to the individual contributors. I'm not sure who owns tf.contrib.factorization, but it'd be great if they could add this.
I'm not sure who owns tf.contrib.factorization, but it'd be great if they could add a shape function for their ops to avoid this error :).

		Perhaps &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/agarwal-ashish&gt;@agarwal-ashish&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  is the right contact to get a NearestNeighbors shape function registered on Windows.

		The upside of adding a shape function is that benefits Linux and Windows, and you don't have to mess around with CMake :).

 Ah yes my mistake, a NearestNeighbors shape function will indeed help all platforms.  Let's see what &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/agarwal-ashish&gt;@agarwal-ashish&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has to say on this matter.

		I agree that adding a shape function to NearestNeighbors sounds like a good next step to fix this issue. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mahatosourav91&gt;@mahatosourav91&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 have you tried that / are planning on trying that ?

 Sorry I have a very little understanding of tensorflow framework right now, so I couldn't find the correct place where the change is to be made. Currently I am working by modifying the gen_clustering_ops.py which I know is a bad idea.

 It would be very helpful if you can look into this issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7784#issuecomment-283346222&gt;7748 &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 also.

		I have a fix in the works that will enable tf.contrib.factorization on Windows.

 What about linux?

		The same change should fix Linux as well.

, I am a newbie to the TensorFlow. Could you please elaborate on the below. I am looking for the resolution as I am facing the same issue.

How would I get the fix related to tf.contrib.factorization? Is there a version number? or a release?
If there is no release associated with fix, how can I reproduce the fix in my environment.

 The fix to this issue is included in the 1.1 release.
