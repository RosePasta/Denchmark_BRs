	<summary>NotImplementedError: Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor (truediv_2:0) to a numpy array</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Mac OS Catalina
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0
Python version: 3.7.0

Describe the current behavior
I get the following error

NotImplementedError: Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor (truediv_2:0) to a numpy array.

When executing the following code
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tf.config.experimental_run_functions_eagerly(True)


def get_mnist_data(normalize=True, categorize=True):
    img_rows, img_cols = 28, 28
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

    if tf.keras.backend.image_data_format() == 'channels_first':
        x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 1, img_rows, img_cols)
        x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 1, img_rows, img_cols)
        input_shape = (1, img_rows, img_cols)
    else:
        x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)
        x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)
        input_shape = (img_rows, img_cols, 1)

    x_train = x_train.astype('float32')
    x_test = x_test.astype('float32')

    if normalize:
        x_train /= 255
        x_test /= 255

    if categorize:
        y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train)
        y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test)

    return x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, input_shape


def get_model(input_shape, num_classes=10):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(tfp.layers.Convolution2DFlipout(6, input_shape=input_shape, kernel_size=3, padding="SAME",
                                              activation=tf.nn.relu))
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten())
    model.add(tfp.layers.DenseFlipout(num_classes))
    return model


def train():
    x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, input_shape = get_mnist_data()

    batch_size = 64

    model = get_model(input_shape)

    model.summary()

    model.compile(loss="categorical_crossentropy")

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    train()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This error is caused by the statement . However, if I remove that statement, I get another well known, older and extremely annoying problem/bug that is described in this other issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33729&gt;#33729&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that doesn't allow me to do anything for my work.
Describe the expected behavior
NO BUG or ERROR.

 You are not using TensorFlow 2.1.0 in that gist.
The new versions of TF are even buggier, so I would like to avoid discussions related to newer versions now (unless they solve my problems, which would be like a miracle).

the error on 2.1 is as per &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/becf16d3881ca46fdede5d74a9263b7b/untitled150.ipynb&gt;this gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 You're using  in that gist. Use TFP 0.9.0 (the last stable version).

I also ran the code shared by you on nightly and do not face any errros, please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/1c8ac54efa0b60e865f1e845ddf8ce75/38836.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi, I am also getting the exact same issue, but sorry for not sharing the code as it is on a project.
Is there any solution for this?
i am getting this error when eager execution is enabled, but i can get it to work when it is disabled,
i need eager execution for debugging my code.
