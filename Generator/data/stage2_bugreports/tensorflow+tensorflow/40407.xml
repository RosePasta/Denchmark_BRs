	<summary>tensorboard --logdir=runs not working: Abort trap: 6</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS Catalina
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version: 2.2.0
Python version: 3.7.4
Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?: pip3
CUDA/cuDNN version: -

I am trying to run tensorboard: tensorboard --logdir=runs.
I have also tried: tensorboard --logdir=runs --host=127.0.0.1.
I am running the command from the terminal from within the the directory, which contains the runs folder.
I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[libprotobuf FATAL external/com_google_protobuf/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.cc:1367] 
CHECK failed: GeneratedDatabase()-&gt;Add(encoded_file_descriptor, size): 
libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type google::protobuf::FatalException: 
CHECK failed: GeneratedDatabase()-&gt;Add(encoded_file_descriptor, size): 
Abort trap: 6
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My Python code contains the following lines:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tb_path = './runs/SimpleLSTM_MNIST'
if os.path.isdir(tb_path):
    shutil.rmtree(tb_path)

writer = tb.SummaryWriter(log_dir=tb_path)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My runs folder contains the folder SimpleLSTM_MNIST, which contains events.out.tfevents.1591953948.computername.local.29440.0.
I also tried installing , as suggested &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60028929/failing-to-launch-tensorboard-from-jupyter&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but still get the same issue.

		As mentioned in this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35573#issuecomment-596863684&gt;comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, try using latest version of protobuf and lt me know if it works. Thanks!

 resolving this issue required downgrading  to version 2.0.0 as well as  to version 3.8.0. Is it possible to have  to be compatible on macOS with ?

		Based on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35573&gt;#35573&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this sounds like a generic issue with importing TensorFlow at all, when using a certain combination of TF versus protobuf versions.  But in that issue it sounds mostly like newer versions of protobuf might fix it.
FWIW, I can't reproduce the issue myself (on macOS Catalina, with TF 2.2.0, it installs protobuf 3.12.2, and it all seems to work fine).
So my advice would be to try updating TF to 2.2.0, and you should also get protobuf 3.12.2, and see if you still have the issue.  If so, I would try  to confirm if it's a generic TF issue, and if that results in the same error I would follow up on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35573&gt;#35573&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 directly instead of here.
If you do see this happening again with tensorboard but not with tensorflow generally, then please launch tensorboard with --verbosity=1 so we can pinpoint at what point TensorBoard hits this issue, and please provide as much detail as you can about how you installed TF/TB and their dependencies to trigger the issue (i.e. ideally commands you ran from scratch to get to that point, or at least the output of pip freeze).
I'm going to close proactively since this looks a lot like a duplicate, but if you can trace this back to tensorboard just leave a comment and we can revisit.
