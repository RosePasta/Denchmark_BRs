&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of the issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are lots of links are broken, some of them are:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes/DType&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes/DType&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/get_structure&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/get_structure&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/assert_same_float_dtype&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/assert_same_float_dtype&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/ModeKeys&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/ModeKeys&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/fill&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/fill&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are lots of the link is broken in r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/index.md. when someone clicks on these links it's showing 404 ERROR.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I checked  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I found out every links
are correct. For example

tf.DType link is broken in Github but working fine in TensorFlow website
As the numbers of broken links are big. I'll suggest adding a message like
" Our TensorFlow 2.0 RC docs is moved to https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python. Kindly checkout there"
I have seen this type of message in some of the TensorFlow docs.

  Yes there are lot of broken links, because they removed API GitHub. Maybe you can remove all links. As members add  links automatically when the website documentation gets generated.

		As major migration occurs from one version to another. Lots of links get broken. They soon will be deleted or replaced ones documentation gets updated.
