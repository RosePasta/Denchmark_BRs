When I was reading the Russian translation of this documentation page, I found a few places with not a natural way of using the Russian language(I'm a native Russian speaker), also I noticed a few small typo mistakes. I carefully read the whole page and compared with the original article on English and made some updates. The PR with these changes will be sent in the next couple of minutes after opening this issue. PR with updates: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/pull/345&gt;tensorflow/docs#345&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
