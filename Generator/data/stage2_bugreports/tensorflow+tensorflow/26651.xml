		Just to clarify. This is an issue as the documentation is not updated in accordance to the renaming in TF2.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; import tensorflow as tf
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.__version__
'2.0.0-alpha0'
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.image.resize_image_with_pad

		I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/meyerjo&gt;@meyerjo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is right, the symbol is exported as  in 2.0 and not , which is v1, so the published doc is incorrect.
It is just a matter of re-running the docs generation and uploading the new version.
You can check what docs would be generated with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;bazel-bin/third_party/tensorflow/tools/docs/generate2 --output_dir=/tmp/tf2_docs_preview
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I ran that locally and it produces the right docs. I'm leaving that issue open until we update the site.
