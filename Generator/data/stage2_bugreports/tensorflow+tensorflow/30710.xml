	<summary>No way to generate HTML docs from source</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1574&gt;#1574&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 there was no (open source) way to generate HTML docs from the TensorFlow source code in March of 2016. Is that still the case? I haven't been able to find any way to generate HTML docs from the source.
Generating offline HTML docs is useful for having access to offline docs &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/dash-docset-tensorflow&gt;without having to scrape www.tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		Apparently this is expected behavior as the generation is done by closed source infrastructure, but the generated HTML is published in the docs repo in the release branches, so for example, for 1.14, it's here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/r1.14/site/en/api_docs&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/r1.14/site/en/api_docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Closing as this solves my problem.
