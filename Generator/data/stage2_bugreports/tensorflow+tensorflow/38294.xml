	<summary>Tensorflow keras.callbacks.ModelCheckPoint with wrong path doesn't save anything instead of raising error</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: NO
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from: pip install --upgrade tf-nightly
TensorFlow version: 2.2.0-dev20200403
Python version: 3.7.7
CUDA version: cuda 10.1
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA 2080 and TITAN X

Describe the current behavior
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model_checkpoint = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint('Output/task1/Model/Task1_ResNet50_ImageNet/Task1_ResNet50-{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.h5', verbose=1, save_best_only=True)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The path here in ModelCheckpoint is a wrong path since there is NO sub-folder named "Task1_ResNet50_ImageNet" in "Model" folder. While after 30 epochs training, there is no error raised, neither model saved.
Describe the expected behavior
It was supposed to raise error since there is no such a directory to save modelcheckpoint. While after 3 days training, I got nothing saved! It wastes me lots of time.

Since my own code is too complicated, I use the example code from &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/#multilayer-perceptron-mlp-for-multi-class-softmax-classification&gt;Keras.io&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to explain this problem: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/MakeCent/5ac59661a91e1d5126b89e6b0026e1c0/38294.ipynb&gt;stand alone gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs
During the training, it print save model information like below, which looks like working well:
Epoch 00008: val_loss improved from 9.19709 to 8.58308, saving model to Output/task1/Model/Task1_ResNet50_ImageNet/Task1_ResNet50_ImageNet-08-8.58.h5

@MakeCent
please provide us with complete standalone code for us to replicate the issue faced.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Saduf2019&gt;@Saduf2019&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I have updated the standalone code based on an example code from &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/#multilayer-perceptron-mlp-for-multi-class-softmax-classification&gt;Keras.io &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

please share simple stand alone code for us to replicate the issue, if possible please share a colab gist of the code and issue faced.

i have made the required change in gist shared, now the code works fine, please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/adf8644fb73b495d48c5bcfee2f9e070/38294.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

import tensorflow.keras instead import keras, please confirm if this resolves your issue.

It seems it only appear in tf-nightly. Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/MakeCent/5ac59661a91e1d5126b89e6b0026e1c0/38294.ipynb&gt;code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I want to save Model as XXX.ckpt. But when I set "save_weights_only=False":
cp_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(filepath=ckpt_models/test.ckpt,  save_weights_only=False, verbose=0,mode='auto')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5,callbacks=[cp_callback])
It raise an error::
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: Failed to create a directory: ckpt_models/test.ckpt\variables; No such file or directory
When I set "save_weights_only=True",everything Ok, but no XXX.ckpt.meta file saved.

 I test your code on tensorflow 2.1, but no error raised and every ckpt files saved  correctly. Maybe you need check if it's related to your tf version. By the way, if you want to save whole model in addition to weights, you'd better to use HDM5(.h5) or SaveModel(no extension) instead of ckpt.

Thank everyone. I have solved problem. Error was caused by save path have both '/' and '\'. Tensorflow attach dir with '\' automatically.
If I only use ‘\’ in path, the problem gone.
I guess it raleted to OS or enviroment.
My enviroment: WIN10_X64, PYTHON 3.6, TF2.1.
