		Not able to find out the original page which links to this 404 error page. Is it been directed from &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		This  is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/div_no_nan&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from the documentation. And as I said the link is as it should be but when you go there you see the 404 error page. Or am I not understanding the question?

		Sorry for not able to convey the message. It looks like you are referring to wrong page. Please have a look to this &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math/divide_no_nan&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which is under tf.math with the name divide_no_nan and let us know if this is the one you are searching for. Thanks!

		Yeah, I looks like this is the correct link. The fact is, in the docs task the name of the API symbol is &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/div_no_nan&gt;tf.div_no_nan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 whereas &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math/divide_no_nan&gt;tf.math.divide_no_nan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is not even present there. I think this might be the symbol that was meant to be there. Also, sorry for the late reply .

		Yeah, and now someone needs to add the correct symbol to the docs task.
