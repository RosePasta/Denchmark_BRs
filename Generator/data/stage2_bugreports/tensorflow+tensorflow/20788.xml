	<summary>Issue with `natural_exp_decay` documentation</summary>
	<description>
The example in the tf.train.natural_exp_decay documentation uses an nonexistent function called exponential_time_decay. Also, it is missing the decay_steps parameter in both the example and the showed equation
Equation:

 who owns these? The docstring seems to have been there for years, and it doesn't look as if exponential_time_decay has ever existed.

		I bet the function was renamed a long time ago, but the docstring wasn't updated. Everybody owns this. A PR to fix the docstring would be very welcome. I think this virtual function name should just be corrected to natural_exp_decay. I am also not sure that the earlier "decay exponentially with a base of 0.96" is useful (or correct).

		I made an internal change.
