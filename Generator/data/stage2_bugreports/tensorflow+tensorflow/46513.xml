	<summary>Apple M1 `MLC` ops not supported (e.g., tf.MLCConv2D)</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):

macOS 11.1 (Big Sur) running on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020)

TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

Binary, from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos&gt;https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source):

'2.4.0-rc0'
Command used to run the converter or code if you’re using the Python API
If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
    tflite_model = converter.convert()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The output from the converter invocation
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/python/framework/func_graph.py:590:0: error: 'tf.MLCConv2D' op is neither a custom op nor a flex op
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also, please include a link to the saved model or GraphDef
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;There's a similar issue here:
https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/133
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Failure details
Conversion fails, since tf.MLCConv2D is not the same as tf.Conv2D.  The same is true for other operations like tf.MLCMatMul.

What's the right path forward here for using Lite, and then Lite Micro on an M1 Mac?  Should conversion from MLC be supported?  I attempted to work around this using  as mentioned at the very bottom of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos&gt;https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but did not understand what syntax I should be using.

Can you try with below code and see if it helps you.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(loaded_model)
converter.experimental_new_converter=True
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS,
                                       tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS]
tflite_quant_model = converter.convert()
open("converted_model.tflite", "wb").write(tflite_quant_model)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If you are still facing the issue please share colab link or simple standalone code with supporting files to reproduce the issue in our environment.It helps us in localizing the issue faster. Thanks!

Hi @ravikyram--
No, this did not help--but would we expect lite to already have converter support for these MLC ops?
To reproduce the issue, you can even use the magic wand notebook found in the Tensorflow repository here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/magic_wand/train/train_magic_wand_model.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/magic_wand/train/train_magic_wand_model.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Worth noting: I have steps similar to these later in my code, where I'm quantizing the model to run on microcontrollers that support only INT-8.  All of that works fine on my identically configured Intel MacBook Pro, but fails at this earlier step on the M1 MacBook Pro.

		The  operators are not a part of the official TensorFlow project. You need to enable them through user-defined TF Select option in the TFLite. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thaink&gt;@thaink&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you help this?

 Where is the definition of MLC ops?

		Great question. Perhaps the authors of this blog post would know?

		If the TF version you use comes from the fork, the issue should be opened against the fork

		Thank you, Mihai.  I'l continue following up on that fork here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/133&gt;apple/tensorflow_macos#133&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
