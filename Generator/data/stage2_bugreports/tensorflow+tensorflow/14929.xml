	<summary>Number of bytes mismatch when reading tflite schema</summary>
	<description>
I train a model outside and convert it into.lite format and import it to the iOS projectï¼Œbut I  encounter a problem below:why?
Loaded model resolved reporter tensorflow/contrib/lite/interpreter.cc:481 required_bytes != bytes (4 != 16)Tensor 88 is invalidly specified in schema.
Failed to construct interpreter

		Could you possibly provide more information about your model (source code) and tflite converted model binary file?

		I got the same error.
My model is defined by
