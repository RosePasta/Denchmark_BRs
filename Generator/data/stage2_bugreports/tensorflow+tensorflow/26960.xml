System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes, I have a minimal test file
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
tf.version
'2.0.0-alpha0'
Python version:
$ python3
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): binary installer version 0.23
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
$ gcc --version
gcc (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04) 7.3.0

GPU model and memory: Not supported

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the current behavior
tf.compat.v2.summary.scalar("stddev",_st,step=count,description='stddev')
is being processed as an _api.v1.summary
Describe the expected behavior
tf.compat.v2.summary.scalar("stddev",_st,step=count,description='stddev')
is processed as an _api.v2.summary
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tf_sdata = tf.convert_to_tensor(sdata,dtype=tf.float32,name="tf_sdata")
tfdata_stddev = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf_sdata[:,0])

tfstddev_iter = tfdata_stddev.__iter__()

stats_writer = tf.compat.v2.summary.create_file_writer(logs_path,max_queue=10,flush_millis=120000,
        filename_suffix='.stats',name='stats_writer')

count = 1
for _st in tfstddev_iter:
    tf.compat.v2.summary.scalar("stddev",_st,step=count,description='stddev')
    count += 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I think you need to mark the  as default. Either by calling  (do not directly add this call to the creation of the SummaryFileWriter [&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25976&gt;#25976&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
]) or by setting up the summary scope like this:
with stats_writer.as_default():
    count = 1
    for _st in tfstddev_iter:
        tf.compat.v2.summary.scalar("stddev",_st,step=count,description='stddev')
        count += 1

		meyerjo, thank you for your comment.
I tried the context: with stats_writer.as_default():
This produced the same Traceback:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "./tf2summary_bug.py", line 72, in 
tf.compat.v2.summary.scalar("stddev",_st,step=count,description='stddev')
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tensorboard/plugins/scalar/summary_v2.py", line 55, in scalar
with tf.summary.summary_scope(
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow._api.v1.summary' has no attribute 'summary_scope'
I do not see why this would need a custom summary scope. The problem seems to be the code is executing in the summary_v2.py code as expected and encountering a v1.summary object that is not expected. I could be wrong. Just thinking out loud.
