Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support. &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g. fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow)?:
OS Platform and Distribution (i.e. Linux Ubuntu 16.0):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)?:
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU Model and Memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tools/&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tools/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can collect the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print (tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem clearly&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source Code / Logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full-traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to reproducible test-case code the bare-minimum necessary to generate the problem

		I install Tensorflow in Windows, and run the same code which I have already run in Linux. But I find the running time is twice as much as Linux.

		We're sorry, but without a reproducible test case, it is impossible to help you with this problem. Please submit a new issue when you can submit the exact code. Also include the exact platform information (see template above) for both your Linux and Windows machine.
