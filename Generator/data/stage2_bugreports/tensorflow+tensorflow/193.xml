	<summary>Building from source for BSD</summary>
	<description>
Arch linux uses this line:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;bazel build --jobs 2 -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am on BSD, and I would rather build just executables, and not a pip package. How do I do this? Could you add build instructions?

		Building from source is on our &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md&gt;installation page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but we haven't tested it for BSD so it may not work out of the box.

		<comment id='2' author='yurivict' date='2015-11-13T23:15:25Z'>
		Can you give the build a try on BSD, and if it fails, add the flag --verbose_errors and paste them?  Would love to see what issues you have.  Please also provide us with details about your setup (BSD type and version, architecture, etc.)

		The only bazel command without "pip" on installation page is this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/cc:tutorials_example_trainer
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and it fails:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: Loading of target '//tools/jdk:jdk' failed; build aborted: no such package 'tools/jdk': BUILD file not found on package path.
ERROR: Loading failed; build aborted.
INFO: Elapsed time: 0.075s
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What is this "tools/jdk"? I do have jdk installed.

		What version of jdk do you have installed?  How did you install bazel?  Can you run the build with the flag --verbose_failures?

		<comment id='5' author='yurivict' date='2015-11-15T02:34:50Z'>
		I have jdk-8.60.24. Bazel is from FreeBSD port.
--verbose_failures doesn't change the output.

		xUbuntu use this command
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;bazel build --jobs 2 -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures

 looks like you're missing the python-dev package, and your question is unrelated to the one above.  if you continue to have problems please open a new issue instead of commenting in this one.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yurivict&gt;@yurivict&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 sadly we don't have any FreeBSD boxes to play with so you're our guinea pig.  the problem stems from the "jdk" definition &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/687550660db90b007741e1f67a8092b08945f8e3/tools/jdk/BUILD&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the bazel code.  Do you have java/javac in your path?  If you do, can you try building bazel 0.1.0 on your machine and see if that solves the problem?
		</comment>
		<comment id='8' author='yurivict' date='2015-11-16T20:05:16Z'>
		&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# which javac
/usr/local/bin/javac
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I did build the bazel port on my machine. In fact, I created the bazel port for FreeBSD -)
During the bazel port build, tools/jdk/BUILD is present there. bazel builds into one solid executable and passes all tests that come with it. By looking at tools/jdk/BUILD I can't tell what is wrong with it.
I am not sure where I go from here.

		I will ask this question on bazel page. My command fails like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# bazel build --jobs 2 -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures

		It was an incomplete bazel installation.
Now I am getting thee errors:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: /usr/ports/math/tensorflow/work/tensorflow-0.5.0/tensorflow/python/BUILD:1: Extension file not found: 'google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl'.
ERROR: /usr/ports/math/tensorflow/work/tensorflow-0.5.0/tensorflow/tensorboard/BUILD:40:1: error loading package 'tensorflow/python': Extension file not found: 'google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl' and referenced by '//tensorflow/tensorboard:tensorboard'.
ERROR: Loading failed; build aborted.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Another problem is that build process downloads from GitHub. Is there an easy way to switch to the the pre-downloaded GitHub projects folder? All BSDs will have problem with this, because it is unsafe to allow any downloads during build. So you should have the way to build it from pre-downloaded folder.

		TensorFlow has a Git submodule containing protobuf. You would get the Extension file not found: 'google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl' error if you did not clone the tensorflow repo with the --recursive flag to pull in all the Git submodules. Can you try running git submodule update --init in your repo to pull in all submodules and try building again?
Perhaps we should add a check to the tensorflow  script to raise an error if the submodules have not been cloned? In the meantime, we will also work on making the Bazel error message more clear (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/605&gt;bazelbuild/bazel#605&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		Why do you need "Git submodule", and not the regular package dependency? I already have protobuf installed.
		</comment>
		<comment id='16' author='yurivict' date='2015-12-16T07:45:58Z'>
		We were using a version newer than the latest tagged version, which was extremely unlikely to be installed anywhere. To keep the installation simple, we packaged protobuf as a submodule. Assuming we find no more issues in protobuf that we have to fix at head, we can move to making protobuf a library dependency once all our fixes are in a reasonably common released version.
