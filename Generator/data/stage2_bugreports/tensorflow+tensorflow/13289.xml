	<summary>Bug: SDCAModel missbehave/bug when mixing sparse and dense features</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Up-to-date Arch Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):
1.3.0
Python version:
3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:
Any toy problem using https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/linear_optimizer/SdcaModel that mixes sparse and dense features.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It's a bug.
When using both sparse and dense features in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/linear_optimizer/SdcaModel&gt;SDCAModel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the _linear_predictions method output a tensor of wrong shape. This happens because the sparse results and dense results ranks are inconsistent in the current version and summing them trigger an unexpected broadcast.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/13279&gt;#13279&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes the bug.
