	<summary>conv2d calculation results are inconsistent with pytorch</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: 3.6.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:10.1

Describe the current behavior
For some specific data, the calculation results of tensorflow and pytorch are inconsistent
Describe the expected behavior
The calculation results of tensorflow and pytorch are consistent or the difference is small
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    if target_interface == 'conv1':
        weights_torch = torch.from_numpy(np.full((11, 11, 3, 1), 1, np.float64).transpose((3, 2, 0, 1)))
        output_pytorch_cpu = torch.from_numpy(
            F.conv2d(torch.from_numpy(input_pytorch.numpy().transpose((0, 3, 1, 2))), weights_torch, padding=0,
                     stride=4).numpy().transpose((0, 2, 3, 1)))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The version of tensorflow is 1.90. The error operators are conv2d () and avg_pooling (). Thank you.
This error is a fact, and it can be reproduced by using a large number of random tensors as input to conv2d () or avg_pooling (). Thank you.

@lvjunsetup
We see that the code provided is incomplete, please share simple stand alone code to replicate the issue faced along with the tensorflow version on which the error was faced.

Hello, our project is so big that it is difficult to take out the code alone now, I will sort it out and send it to you.

Also i see you are using an old version of tensorflow , could you please try on later version as 1.15 or 2.1 and let us know if that helps.
