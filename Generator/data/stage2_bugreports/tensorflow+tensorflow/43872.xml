Run Code
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="model.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()
Error

I looked into many things but could not find the solution.

		I already looked into the issues section but could not get it resolved. I also tried on tf-nightly but no success. The model and code is from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/foamliu/Deep-Image-Matting&gt;https://github.com/foamliu/Deep-Image-Matting&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The model is converted to tflite successfully. Issue is with the running of model.

		&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sess = tf.keras.backend.get_session()
converter = tf.contrib.lite.TocoConverter.from_session(sess,final.inputs,final.outputs)
converter.allow_custom_ops = True
converter.experimental_new_converter = True
converter=converter.convert()
interpreter=tf.contrib.lite.Interpreter(model_content=converter)
open('model.tflite', 'wb').write(converter)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am converting the model from the session as it has custom layer. For conversion, I am using tf 1.9.0 version. I also tried the conversion with tf 2.2.0 but could not convert it because of custom layer.
