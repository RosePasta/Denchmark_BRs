	<summary>Tensorboard stopped showing runs names</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Tensorboard stopped showing runs names.
I can still filter (blindly) and see the curves, but there are no names of the runs to filter.
Any idea on how to fix that?
TF is installed under anaconda.
It worked with no issues until 2 weeks ago. I got back to the project today and this issue occurred.
I tried reinstalling 0.11, or even installing the latest 0.12.1 (under conda-forge), but the issue hasn't solved.
I also tried (with no luck)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd /home/gamir/yuval/anaconda2/envs/tf_011/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/
python tensorboard.py --logdir=path/to/log
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Attached is a screenshot, and below (the technical details) is the TB console output. Note that under TF12.1 there are no errors on the console output, but the issue still happens.

Thanks

 is that intentional?

		I suspect this is a screen resolution / zoom issue. The UI elements on the top left are fixed size, and the remainder goes to the run names.
Can you try pressing (ctrl + -) or decreasing the zoom level in the browser, and report if that fixes it?

		Embarrassingly (for me) you were right :)
It happens with a 100% zoom, reducing the zoom to 75%, shows the list of runs. Any idea how to still show it with 100% zoom?

 Try changing the resolution on the display. Or you can submit a pull request that reduces the space needed by the UI on the left :)

 Thanks. I don't have permissions to change the resolution on that machine, nor knowledge of UI syntax to make a PR :)
