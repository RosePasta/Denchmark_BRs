&lt;denchmark-link:https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/autodiff&gt;https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/autodiff&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When listing the reason of the "None" gradient (Chapter of "Getting a gradient of None"), the text  "3. Took gradients through an integer or string" is followed by order number "5", which is "5. Took gradients through a stateful object". Suggest to correct it to  "4. Took gradients through a stateful object"
