	<summary>Can't find docs on SSL support for distributed training</summary>
	<description>
Describe the current behavior
I haven't be able to find documentation on if SSL is used during distributed training with tf.distribute.Strategy with gRPC.
Describe the expected behavior
I should be able to easily find this information in the documentation, and if it's supported, then I should easily be able to turn SSL on/off in distributed training for when I prefer security vs performance.

 can one you comment on this? both for the collective ops used in distributed training, but also other types of communication in the runtime in TF2.
