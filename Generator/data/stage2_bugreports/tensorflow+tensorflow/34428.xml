	<summary>Multiple public header files are not usable. Dependencies are missing.</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
The following files import header files from path which are not existing:
$ cd /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/
$ grep -rnw '.' -e 'third_party/gpus/cuda'

./tensorflow/stream_executor/gpu/gpu_types.h:31:#include "third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuComplex.h"
./tensorflow/stream_executor/gpu/gpu_types.h:32:#include "third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuda.h"
./tensorflow/core/util/gpu_kernel_helper.h:22:#include "third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuda_fp16.h"
./tensorflow/core/util/gpu_device_functions.h:34:#include "third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuComplex.h"
./tensorflow/core/util/gpu_device_functions.h:35:#include "third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuda.h"
This is problematic because the headers can't be imported as the path requested does not exist:
$ ls /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/third_party/gpus/cuda/include/
ls: cannot access '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/third_party/gpus/cuda/include/': No such file or directory
Problem was caused by this commit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/922386b9fcc23596877da3500787a045a861cb52#diff-3146a2ef48234a027b42c52f71bcb177&gt;922386b#diff-3146a2ef48234a027b42c52f71bcb177&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This issue lead to multiple issues as soon as CUDA GPUs are used with the C++ API.
Workaround:
As a temporary solution, one may create a symbolic link from the CUDA path, nonetheless modifying system should not be a permanent solution.
mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/third_party/gpus/cuda/
ln -s /usr/local/cuda/include /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/third_party/gpus/cuda/
ls /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/third_party/gpus/cuda/include
Solution:
Instead of:
#include "third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuComplex.h"
#include "third_party/gpus/cuda/include/cuda.h"
Please do:
#include "cuda/include/cuComplex.h"
#include "cuda/include/cuda.h"

 can you share how you're building and/or using TensorFlow?  Are you building a TF pip package and using that?

		Do I understand it correctly that you are attempting to use TF headers that are included along with a  package? I'm not sure if that's supposed to work in principle. Tensorflow in general requires  rather particular build setup in order to work. I would not expect any C++ bits to work/compile outside of that build environment. I could be wrong, though.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sanjoy&gt;@sanjoy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 -- does TF provide precompiled C++ libraries to end-users? Or do we only expose python API packages? I see that there's a separate C library: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but it does not expose any C++ headers.

		There is a custom-op template repo which implements the CUDA kernel using TF Python package; take look at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op/blob/master/tensorflow_time_two/cc/kernels/time_two_kernels.cu.cc#L21&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If you are using Bazel, my guess is that the headers are linked via &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op/blob/master/tensorflow_time_two/BUILD#L34&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Alternatively, if you are using Makefile, take a look at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op/blob/master/Makefile#L34&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Also ping &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yifeif&gt;@yifeif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
; she is the author of the custom-op template repo.

		The custom op most likely requires building it in the same environment where TF itself was built -- the headers rely on all sorts of macros that may be set differently depending on TF build configuration.
Custom op build instructions here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/custom-op&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  use docker containers provided by TF for that purpose.
From the FAQ on that page:

Q: Do I need both the toolchain and the docker image?
A: Yes, you will need both to get the same setup we use to build TensorFlow's official pip package.

I guess that is so, until Op registration is implemented in C API.

		Closing since IIUC there is nothing for us to do here as per comments above..  Please reopen if you disagree.
