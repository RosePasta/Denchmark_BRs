build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
I build a custom Unet with custom Densenet encoder. After I compile model and use fit_generator, I got No gradients provided for any variable
Describe the expected behavior
Model run the training

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

		Hi, it's not a bug, it's how I create the data generator. It is fixed by change
return [x1, x2, x3, x4], y
to
yield [x1, x2, x3, x4], y
