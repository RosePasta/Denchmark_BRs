	<summary>Object detection app built using TFlite is crashing</summary>
	<description>
Hi using tflite android app for object detection.
Followed the below link for building app:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite/examples/android/app&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite/examples/android/app&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

APK is generated and installed on pixel 2XL devices.
Speech recognization works but object detection fails.
Attaching the logs for reference
