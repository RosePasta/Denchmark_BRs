Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10/Juniper lab
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: Notebook
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0-rc3
Python version: 3.8.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: no idea
GPU model and memory: Geforce GTX 960M

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"


I get an error when call tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices with
ValueError: Failed to convert a NumPy array to a Tensor (Unsupported␣
,→object type list), see attachment
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/4515932/Answer.Tensorflow.pad.sequence.feature.column.DenseFeatures.pdf&gt;Answer.Tensorflow.pad.sequence.feature.column.DenseFeatures.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


I tried to use this example
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/EgorBEremeev/SoloLearnML/blob/master/stackoverflow/Answer.%20Tensorflow%20pad%20sequence%20feature%20column.%20DenseFeatures.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/EgorBEremeev/SoloLearnML/blob/master/stackoverflow/Answer.%20Tensorflow%20pad%20sequence%20feature%20column.%20DenseFeatures.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It looks like it was running on 2.0.0-beta1, but not more in the current version. You can use this notebook to reproduce the case.

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/EgorBEremeev/SoloLearnML/blob/master/stackoverflow/Answer.%20Tensorflow%20pad%20sequence%20feature%20column.%20DenseFeatures.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/EgorBEremeev/SoloLearnML/blob/master/stackoverflow/Answer.%20Tensorflow%20pad%20sequence%20feature%20column.%20DenseFeatures.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You need to adapt the path the the csv file which will also be available in the repository.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Was able to reproduce the issue with TF v2.1, &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/1a8342379761f0312278f18c85d09e65/38793.ipynb&gt;TF v2.2.0-rc3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

. Please find the attached gist. Thanks!

		Can you please provide a small reproducible code to validate the behavior? This will help to troubleshoot faster. Thanks!

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ymodak&gt;@ymodak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
example code can be found in amahendrakas comment. In general I have a pandas dataframe with one column as Bag of word list.
I tried to use an examplehttps://github.com/EgorBEremeev/SoloLearnML/blob/master/stackoverflow/Answer.%20Tensorflow%20pad%20sequence%20feature%20column.%20DenseFeatures.ipynb and he already give me an solution. He switched
ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(dataframe), labels))
to
ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dataframe .to_dict(orient='list'), labels))
and then it works.
So I'm not sure if this still is a bug in TF or not. Because in 2.0 beta it works and in 2.1 and following not.
Thanks

		The problem is that from_tensor_slices needs to convert its input into a Tensor, but the given input contains variable-length numpy lists, which cannot be converted into tensors (tensors must be rectangular). You can get the same error message by running
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]], dtype=object)
print(tf.convert_to_tensor(a))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This error appears to occur even in tensorflow 2.0.0-beta1, so it doesn't look like a regression.
To make this work, you need to pad the dataframe's lists so that they are the same length.
