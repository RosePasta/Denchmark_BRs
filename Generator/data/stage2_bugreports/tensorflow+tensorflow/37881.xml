Describe the current behavior
When I try to setting TPU system in google colab in tensorflow 2.0.0, tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system raises GRPC error.
It worked normally until about 12 hours ago and I don't change any codes.
What I try to do to solve this problem?

Any other info / logs
If I use tensorflow 2.1.0, it works fine, but I want to use tensorflow 2.0.0 because I want to use TPU.

i have run the code shared in your gist on same version and tpu but face a different error,please find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/6f9a9a21af272bb3974dcb44a9592a0b/37881.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Looking at the gist, the process leading up to the error is the same, so the cause of the error may be due to the assigned TPU device?
