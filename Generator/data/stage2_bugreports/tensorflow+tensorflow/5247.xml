	<summary>tensorboard demos don't work because of wrong paths</summary>
	<description>
Checked on commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/32d1dcc10e1fdf33dc6742337c6e0869f7b3c557&gt;32d1dcc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Issue:
While going through tensorboard/DEVELOPMENT.MD it is not possible to have tensorboard's demos working as demo's html as well as components htmls import other html with wrong file names.
For example in:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/demo/index.html&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/demo/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

there is an import of ../components/tf-tensorboard/tf-tensorboard.html and in fact this file doesn't exist. It exist under slightly different file name with replaced "-" with "_" (../components/tf_tensorboard/tf-tensorboard.html)
The difference is in directory names.
The same occurs if I want to load particular component's demo.

		Hey again.
The merged PR is not the real fix as directory names should be changed because more html files depend on old names (names with "-" not with "_").
Basically currently any single html file inside &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/components&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/components&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and subdirectories has wrong paths.
