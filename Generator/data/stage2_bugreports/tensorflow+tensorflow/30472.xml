		I am able to reproduce the issue with Tensorflow 1.14.0 on Colab.

		I don't think this is a TensorFlow issue as you are just redefining a flag that tensorflow knows.
It can be argued that TensorFlow should not need flags as it is a library, though.

 do you know where do we define the log_dir flag? I can't find it in a cursory search of the TF codebase...

		We don't, it's abseil defining it as soon as one of abseil modules is imported.

When with TF 1.12, there is no such issue. With TF 1.14, the absl.flags._exceptions.DuplicateFlagError is raised.

		Hi there, as Mihai said this flag is defined in absl: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py/blob/master/absl/logging/__init__.py#L234&gt;https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py/blob/master/absl/logging/__init__.py#L234&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Importing tensorflow as of 1.14 causes an import of absl logging, which itself defines certain flags like log_dir. The good news is the workaround is very easy -- just don't define the log_dir flag, and rely on the one already defined.
If for some reason you need to run on both TF 1.14 and pre-1.14, you can wrap your flag definition in a try/except.
Closing this issue, please let us know if the workaround is insufficient.

This breaks some apps built on top of TF, and all related tools should be rewritten, because these apps are likely to have their own default value of log_dir which the tools are not likely to overwrite. Now, the log_dir needs to be assigned.
Anyway, this won't be bother me as I don't own such apps or tools.

		Though this issue is easy to fix, I still believe this is a compatibility issue that should be avoided.
