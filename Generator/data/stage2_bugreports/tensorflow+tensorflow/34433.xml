System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes (attached file code_warning_py38.py.txt -&gt; rename it as .py and execute it)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): This problem occurs with both r2.0 (built from head) and r2.1rc0
Python version: 3.8 virtual environment (The problem does not occur with Python 3.7.3)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.26.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 7.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 10 / cuDNN 7.6.5
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Ti

Describe the current behavior
export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10
Run the attached python script (renamed as .py)
python code_warning_py38.py &amp;&gt; output.txt
Read the output in the attached output.txt
Describe the expected behavior
There is no warning message when the script is run with Python 3.7.3

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
See both files attached.

		Works without warning or error with Tf 2.0 and Python 3.6.
Please see the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/gadagashwini/850e1f79b50a8847c2fff9e42aa2b4bf/untitled274.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jvishnuvardhan&gt;@jvishnuvardhan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I expected Python 3.6 with TF2.0 to work without warning or error.
I believe this problem only occurs with Python 3.8 with TF2.0 built from source using Python 3.8.
All the best,
Daniel

		I'm looking into this, but am a bit swamped today. If you have the chance, could you check the version of gast you have installed?

		Hi Dan,
gast==0.2.2
Cheers

		Thanks, that saved me a few roundtrips.
I ran a build with 3.8, and it looks like the AST transformations need to be updated to work with Python 3.8, I suspect that's because of the grammar changes. I'll make the necessary fixes, hopefully it won't take more than a week or two to finish them.

		Update - after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a396eb4a3a7dc08b859df42919fcc7bdf8236a01&gt;a396eb4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, 3.8 syntax should be fully supported. I'm re-checking the script to see if anything else remains.

		Looks like astor is not compatible with 3.8, either, so we'll need to replace that dependency. Fortunately it's fairly straightforward to swap in something else like astunparse.

		<comment id='10' author='dbonner' date='2020-01-16T14:26:47Z'>
		Progress update - upgrade to astunparse is done, awaiting new release of gast which fixes a bug with FunctionDef nodes in 3.8 (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/gast/pull/43&gt;serge-sans-paille/gast#43&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		This should now be fixed at head. With the pip package from source, running code_warning_py38.py should no longer print a warning.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?

		I can't test the resolution until I build tensorflow for python 3.8.0.  Unfortunately my build is failing (see issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36170&gt;#36170&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I got the build to work.  Yes, this is fixed.
