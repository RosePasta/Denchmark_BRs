	<summary>[TF 2.0 API Docs] tf.keras.Sequential</summary>
	<description>
System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0 alpha
Doc Link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/sequential.py

Describe the documentation issue
- Description:
The order of  and  is alphabetical, probably by TF doc design. With a large doc for an arguably popular module such as  navigating around it may be confusing to the user. Perhaps we should start with the most important ones e.g.  and  under Methods. Since , like many other modules/classes, expands on  it would still be logical to list certain Properties, Methods etc in the beginning (at the top of the page) in order of importance for better UX. See: &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/models/sequential/&gt;https://keras.io/models/sequential/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as a good example where these are not in alphabetical order.
Also, in the beginning after a short intro ("inherits from ... a linear stack of layers"), a link to "Build a Simple Model" (with ) in TensorFlow would be cool for those who are new to /TF - &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/overview#sequential_model&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/overview#sequential_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Also, the official Keras.io docs include a URL in &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/models/sequential/&gt;https://keras.io/models/sequential/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to "Getting started with the Keras Sequential model": &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide&gt;https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
- Examples:
There already is an example right in the beginning. Maybe adding adding a separate link to or copying an example from this Sequential notebook would be cool too - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

)
- Parameters
Inconsistent. Some reformatting may be needed e.g. input_shape -&gt; input_shape.
Also, both Arguments and Args are used throughout the doc.
- Returns, Raises:
Sometimes exist, sometimes not - creates a UX issue because of inconsistency.
- Visuals:
A simple one similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 would be appreciated.
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
For sure.

		We are linking off to guides now: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential?version=nightly&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential?version=nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Regarding the ordering, this is being tracked internally and being worked on. Closing this for now. Please reopen if something is not fixed :)
