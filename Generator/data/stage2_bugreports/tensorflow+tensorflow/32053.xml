System information

Windows Server 2019 Essentials and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS in WSL
TensorFlow installed with pip3 install
TensorFlow version: All versions above 1.6.0 throw an error
Python version: 3.6.8
Installed using pip
Only CPU

I am trying to use this GitHub repository: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/begeekmyfriend/tacotron&gt;https://github.com/begeekmyfriend/tacotron&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. And all versions above 1.6.0 don't work. I get an error: core dumped. If I install older versions I get different errors like this:  -&gt; On version 1.5.0
Google search didn't helped.
I ran this command:  sudo python3 train.py
Log after I run command above:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;user@SERVER:/mnt/d/tts/tacotron-master$ sudo python3 train.py

		Hi!
The code for train process is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/begeekmyfriend/tacotron/blob/master/train.py&gt;https://github.com/begeekmyfriend/tacotron/blob/master/train.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I am just wondering is there a problem with WSL and Windows Server 2019? Because similar code worked okay on my laptop running Windows 10 in WSL.

		Hi!
Yes, I checked. I checked with versions from 1.2.0 to 1.9.0 and the newest. And above 1.6.0 I get an error about core dumped.
