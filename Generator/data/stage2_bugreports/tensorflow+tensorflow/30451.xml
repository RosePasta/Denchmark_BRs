	<summary>Add warning to dropout that it violates Google patent US9406017B2</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Google who to a large extent runs this project has patented dropout.  See &lt;denchmark-link:https://patents.google.com/patent/US9406017B2/en&gt;https://patents.google.com/patent/US9406017B2/en&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This patent is not listed as a pledged patent in Google's list of patents that are thus  covered by the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/patents/&gt;Google Open Patent Non-Assertion Pledge&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Since this could cause serious issues for users, it needs to be documented.

		It is possible that the current dropout implementations have been designed to work around this patent.  If not, working around the patent should be considered.
