You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
ValueError: Tried to convert 'shape' to a tensor and failed. Error: None values not supported.
Describe the expected behavior
Successfully saving the model (as with implementation=1)
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
input = tf.keras.Input(
            shape=(10,1),
)
output = tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D(
            1,
            5,
            5,
            implementation=3,  # implementation=1 does not cause error
)(input)
model = tf.keras.Model(
            inputs=input,
            outputs=output,
)
tf.saved_model.save(model, "tmp")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

I ran the code shared on tf nightly and &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/8ab958a6790d5df7559b3ac0329f384c/untitled469.ipynb&gt;tf 2.3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i do not see any error on nightly please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/5c2a17183155bdd13381e01282456350/untitled468.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
