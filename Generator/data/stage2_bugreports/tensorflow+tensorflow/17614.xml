Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

There is an small error in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac#determine_which_tensorflow_to_install&gt;installation guild&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The site give an example command of installing TensorFlow in the active Virtualenv for macOS, python which is actually for py3 with pip3 command.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; $ pip3 install --upgrade \

		I believe this was fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f4e70be18b104fbb2efeefeb83bea190aec12727&gt;f4e70be&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but an update to the site hasn't been pushed since.

 : Can we push an update?

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MarkDaoust&gt;@MarkDaoust&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 It looks like the issue was fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f4e70be18b104fbb2efeefeb83bea190aec12727&gt;f4e70be&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but later it has been overridden by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9dae88dace281c0c5dc3b9e15521a6c46feb6d75&gt;9dae88d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I created &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/17617&gt;#17617&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to get the fix back.
