	<summary>Saving and loading nested models fails</summary>
	<description>
EDIT: I adjusted the bug description the bug appears in a different place than I thought before.
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: -
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): unknown 2.1.0 (Installation from conda repository)
Python version: 3.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -

Describe the current behavior
I created a simple nested tensorflow.keras model with an input node and sequential model containing two convolutional layers:
import tensorflow as tf
model_inside = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, 3, input_shape=(None,None,1)),
                                   tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(2, 1, activation='softmax')])

model_outside_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(256, 256, 1))
model_outside = model_inside(model_outside_input)

model_outside = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=model_outside_input, outputs=model_outside)
Saving this model to disk in SavedModel format and loading it again results in a TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not NoneType.
According to my observations this error only occurs with nested models.
Describe the expected behavior
I expect the loaded model to be exactly the same as before saving it and loading should not lead to an error.

 I don't see any issue with  and saving in  as . Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/224c93836dc5265ad42d565b1897e528/tf-2-saving-nested-models-fails.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I ran your code as it is in  and I don't see any issues. Recently, there were lot of improvements in saving the model. I think this issue was resolved by one of those recent changes.
I am closing this issue as it was resolved. Feel free to reopen if this was not resolved for you. Thanks!
