		Closed by mistake. It is the sample code on Tensorflow.org and it is not working with TF-NIGHTLY code.

		Wow... i really don't have colab, here is the link again, can you not use this ?
I do it locally. This code is a sample code from Tensorflow.org and it is not working with the latest build i do locally. If it is too difficult for you guys to test your own code, i will just move to MxNet. I have a problem to solve here.
The sample code to debug this issue is at,
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/structured_data/time_series.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/structured_data/time_series.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

From Colab,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print('Input shape:', wide_window.example[0].shape)
try:
  print('Output shape:', multi_step_dense(wide_window.example[0]).shape)
except Exception as e:
  print(f'\n{type(e).__name__}:{e}')
-----------------------------------------------------
error,
Input shape: (32, 24, 19)
InvalidArgumentError:Matrix size-incompatible: In[0]: [32,456], In[1]: [57,32] [Op:MatMul]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This seems to work in Colab, but not working on the code i build locally, what is it in Colab ? How do i see what version of the code is in Colab ?
This is the part of the code that is giving me issues.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;history = compile_and_fit(conv_model, conv_window)
IPython.display.clear_output()
val_performance['Conv'] = conv_model.evaluate(conv_window.val)
performance['Conv'] = conv_model.evaluate(conv_window.test, verbose=0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Learned something with '```'
Looks like this is not happening in Colab, not sure what changed. But I still have the original error... some people are reporting that this is CUDNN initialization issue. And the shortcut seems to disable GPU completely, and only runs on CPU.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.compat.v1 import ConfigProto
from tensorflow.compat.v1 import InteractiveSession
config = ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = InteractiveSession(config=config)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And this solution did not help either, TF_CUDNN_RESET_RND_GEN_STATE=1
So i wonder, how would we go about convolution network if GPU support is not available.

		I am giving up on these because i have many core CPU, i have a problem to work on.
