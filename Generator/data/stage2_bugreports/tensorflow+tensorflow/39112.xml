System information

Windows Platform
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source):1.15

i first build toco
bazel run -c opt tensorflow/lite/toco
then
toco --graph_def_file=object_detection/inference_graph_for_tflite/tflite_graph.pb \ --output_file=object_detection/inference_graph_for_tflite/detect.tflite \ --input_shapes=1,300,300,3 \ --input_arrays=normalized_input_image_tensor \ --output_arrays='TFLite_Detection_PostProcess','TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:1','TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:2','TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:3' \ --allow_custom_ops
result

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I was thinking that the error must be because of the issue i just post here:

Please provide with simple stand alone code for us to replicate the issue faced.
Also is there any particular reason to use an older version of tensor flow would you want to try on a later version and see if it helps.

		I don't mind using 2.x version I just use this cause most tutorial i get was version 1.x and there was
issues with pycoco. So, i trained my model in that version. Is it possible to use 2.x conversion to convert 1.x ?

No there is no such conversion from 2.x to 1.x as requested for.
kindly try with later versions and see if that helps resolve the issue.

yes, I can't provide the code since, I also tweak with the python and can't remember all. Is there still no support for object tracking in version 2.x? and is it possible to run an application with a train model of version 1.x to version 2.x?

As informed earlier there is no such conversion from 2.x to 1.x as requested for., please confirm if we may move this to closed status.
