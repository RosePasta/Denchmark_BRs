	<summary>Keras mismatches outputs and targets</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.0.0-rc2-26-g64c3d382ca 2.0.0
Python version: 3.6.9

Describe the current behavior

We build a keras model with outputs like task_a_logits, task_a_probs, task_b_logits, task_b_probs
We compile our model by passing a loss dict like {"task_a_logits": ..., "task_b_logits": ...} (Note that no loss is applied on the probabilities). All losses are applied on the logits.
We build a dataset that yields tuples like (x, {"task_a_logits": ..., "task_b_logits": ...}
To keras.fit(), we pass a dataset that yields targets for each task, also in a dict.

This works without eager execution, but using TF 2.0's defaults, keras gets confused because there are less targets and losses than outputs. &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/georgwiese/57568ac518813b9d9f0e6785d8f707fa&gt;This patch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes the issue.
With the original code and the example above, loss_fns and targets have two elements and outs have four. They get zipped together and then shapes mismatch: logits and labels must be broadcastable: logits_size=[18,4] labels_size=[18,3]
Describe the expected behavior
Keras matches outputs and targets correctly.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
I provided a patch that points to the bug in the Keras source code.
