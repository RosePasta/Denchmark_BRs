	<summary>Memory Growth and Memory Limit incompatibility</summary>
	<description>
System information

Custom Code
OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 10 Home 1909
TensorFlow installed with pip
TensorFlow version: v2.1.0-rc2-17-ge5bf8de410, 2.1.0
Python version: 3.7.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 10.1, cuDNN 7.6.5
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA GTX 1050 notebook, 4GB memory

Describe the current behavior
Tensorflow "forgets" about the setting on memory_growth once you create a vritual device to further limit maximum VRAM usage.
Describe the expected behavior
In practice I would like to be able to both limit maximum VRAM usage AND to tell TF to only use the VRAM that it needs with the memory_growth option. This is something that I was able to do in TF 1.x by passing an appropriate config to a Session, but it doesn't seem like it's possible in TF 2.x (without using 1.x code that is...)

		As mentioned &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config/experimental/set_memory_growth#used-in-the-notebooks&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 If memory growth is enabled for a PhysicalDevice, the runtime initialization will not allocate all memory on the device. Memory growth cannot be configured on a PhysicalDevice with virtual devices configured.

		I understand, but is it possible as it was before to both set memory growth and a hard limit on the maximum amount of memory that it can occupy

		As per the documentation, it is not possible &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/FMalerba&gt;@FMalerba&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
