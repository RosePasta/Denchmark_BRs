	<summary>PyCharms can't resolve certain "from" imports</summary>
	<description>
PyCharms doesn't provide suggestions for some of the TensorFlow imports. For example:
from tensorflow.nn import rnn_cell
from tensorflow.keras import losses
In these cases, PyCharms doesn't provide suggestions for rnn_cell or losses members.
A potential solution for the rnn_cell import is to put API tree under root of TensorFlow pip package instead of under _api/v1 or _api/v2. However, this won't fix suggestions for keras import since keras API is in a different directory and we create an alias for it under tensorflow.
This issue is a follow up from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26502&gt;#26502&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/annarev&gt;@annarev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Could you please let us know when this issue would be resolved as it makes our lives too difficult.
We cannot utilize pycharm now to import keras from tensorflow.

		The code works, at least a simple example from official tf page, but IDE (Pycharm Professional 2019 in my case) still doesn't provide any suggestions; I'm using latest 2.0.0 stable release
