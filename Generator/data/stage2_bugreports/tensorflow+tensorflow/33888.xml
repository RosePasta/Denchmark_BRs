	<summary>Bug in saving model in hdf5 format</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOs Mojave version 10.14.6
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A

Describe the current behavior
When try to save the below model in keras format, we get the following error:
ValueError: Unable to create group (name already exists)
This happens as this model has three layers with name as below:
tf_op_layer_Pad/paddings/0
tf_op_layer_Pad/paddings
tf_op_layer_Pad
Such name causes error in keras as described here - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/12195&gt;keras-team/keras#12195&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Model saving should not fail.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

x = keras.Input(shape=(None,10), dtype="int32", name="input")
T = tf.shape(x)[0]
to_pad = -T % 2
y = tf.pad(x, [[0, to_pad], [0, 0], [0, 0]])
model = keras.Model(inputs=[x,], outputs=[y,])
model.save("model.h5")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


This fix for this has been checked into keras few days ago it seems - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commit/7dee298ebec503c6b0e1727dfd49b89a3fb002d7&gt;keras-team/keras@7dee298&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But it seems TF has its own copy of this hdf5 saving, so it seems this fix will also have to be made there -
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/hdf5_format.py#L624&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/hdf5_format.py#L624&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Saving the model to TensorFlow format (tf) works where as hdf5 saving fails with TF nightly version '2.1.0-dev20191101'
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

x = keras.Input(shape=(None,10), dtype="int32", name="input")
T = tf.shape(x)[0]
to_pad = -T % 2
y = tf.pad(x, [[0, to_pad], [0, 0], [0, 0]])
model = keras.Model(inputs=[x,], outputs=[y,])
model.save("models.tf")

		We need to backport &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/13477&gt;keras-team/keras#13477&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I believe this is a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33565&gt;#33565&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I have the same problem using TF 2.1.0. Calling keras from tensorflow will lead to the same error. As mentioned by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sonu1-p&gt;@sonu1-p&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , TF hasn't updated its own copy of this hdf5 saving.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
