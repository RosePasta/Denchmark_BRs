	<summary>tensorflow Docker behaves different to host (produces nan)</summary>
	<description>
System information
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Mint 19.3 (ubuntu)
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): tf-nightly
Python version: 3.8 and 3.6
two systems:
Host: NVIDIA-SMI 435.21       Driver Version: 435.21       CUDA Version: 10.1 TF: 2.2.0-dev20200325
Docker: NVIDIA-SMI 435.21       Driver Version: 435.21       CUDA Version: 10.1 TF: 2.2.0-dev20200325
Describe the current behavior
In Docker the gradient calculation produces only NANs
On the host the same model produces normal gradients
Describe the expected behavior
in docker the same gradients should be produced
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
can not be provided, sorry, very big model, and problem is hard to locate.
if i can locate the problem i will provide a Standalone code
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
Gradient magnitude on host:

		UPDATE:
OK i found the problem, this is a similar issue to  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/511&gt;#511&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1244&gt;#1244&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

it had nothing to do with docker, but with gpu and cpu inferenz.
On the host the cuda lib could not be loaded and so it ran on cpu and worked, after fixing cuda, it stopt working on gpu on the host to.
