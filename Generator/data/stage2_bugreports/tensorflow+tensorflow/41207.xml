Describe the current behavior
Hi everyone,
I trained a model using Keras.model.fit_generator. However, when I use model.predict_generator(...) and model.predict(...), everything works well BUT I don't get the same predictions for the same image... I am aware of a similar problem &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/3477&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but I tried everything that was suggested (no augmentation used, shuffle=False, renamed my files,...) and still get different results... Anyone could help please?
Describe the expected behavior
I expect to have the same results...
