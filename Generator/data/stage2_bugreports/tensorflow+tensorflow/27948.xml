	<summary>Automatic conversion from CONV_2D to DEPTHWISE_CONV_2D when input channl is 1 in tflite</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
macos 10.14.2
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
None
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
conda install
TensorFlow version (use command below):
tensorflow 1.13
Python version:
python 3.6.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
None
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
None
CUDA/cuDNN version:
None
GPU model and memory:
None

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
I was trying to implement some super resolution models in tensorflow and tflite, and evaluate their speed using tflite benchmark tool. when i use 1 channel input, e.g. input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [1, img_h, img_w, 1]), the first convolution layer automatically became DEPTHWISE_CONV_2D in the benchmark, even if i called "slim.convolution2d" function, and the speed was extremely slow. Then i simply changed the input channel to be 3, e.g. input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [1, img_h, img_w, 3]), the first convolution in benchmark became CONV_2D as normal and the speed became much faster.
below are some information printed out by the benchmark.
first time, input was "inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [1, img_h, img_w, 1])"
