	<summary>TF 2.4.0-rc3: Mismatched protobuf version in setup.py and workspace.bzl</summary>
	<description>
Protobuf version in tensorflow/workspace.bzl and tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py aren't same in TF 2.4.0-rc3.
setup.py has protobuf 3.13 and workspace.bzl still fetches 3.9.2 during the build. Same is the case with master branch.
Is this intentional or to be done item?

		The one in workspace is used when compiling whereas the one in setup.py is needed at pip install time.
This is something that we should fix, but is there a bug that results from this? So we know how to prioritize?

		According to: &lt;denchmark-link:https://abi-laboratory.pro/?view=timeline&amp;l=protobuf&gt;https://abi-laboratory.pro/?view=timeline&amp;l=protobuf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

protobuf 3.9 and 3.13 are not compatible (even the soname has changed). I'd think you'd want to ensure matching internal and external function, no?

		Hmm, you are right. Yes, this is something we need to fix. Thank you
