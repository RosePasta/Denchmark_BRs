	<summary>Github issue creation for bugs missing</summary>
	<description>
Note that the option for bug reports is missing.

I suspect this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/36636&gt;#36636&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which was recently merged.
When I look at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/00-bug-issue.md&gt;00-bug-issue.md file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there is a space instead of a newline before . Don't know if this would cause it to go missing, but definitely seems not right.

Others appear missing as well, such as the build/installation issue, &amp; performance issue.
