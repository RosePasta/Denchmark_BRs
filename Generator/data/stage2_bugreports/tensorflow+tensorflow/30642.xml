	<summary>‘scatter_nd_update’ doesn't work with string</summary>
	<description>

I Reproduced this issue in newest &lt;denchmark-link:https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow&gt;tensorflow official docker image&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.14.0
Python version:2.7.15+


In my model, I need to maintain an extremely long 2-D variable tensor，which has several columns and many rows, and its dtype is string. In every training step, I need to update only several individual rows of that tensor. &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/scatter_nd_update&gt;tf.scatter_nd_update&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 meets my requirements perfectly,
except that it doesn't work with string in fact. As a contrast,  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/scatter_nd&gt;tf.scatter_nd&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does work. Since the document doesn't mention that  can't be string, I think it may be a bug.
Describe the expected behavior
I hope tf.scatter_nd_update support string ref,and I really need this feature in my project. So if it can't be fixed quickly, any walk-around suggestions (include modify some source code) is also welcome.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
ref = tf.Variable([‘qq’,’ww’,’ee’,’rr’,’’,’’,’’,’’])
indices = tf.constant([[4], [3], [1] ,[7]])
updates = tf.constant(['aa', 'dd', 'cc', 'bb'])
update = tf.scatter_nd_update(ref, indices, updates)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
    print(sess.run(update))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
