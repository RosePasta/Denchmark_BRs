System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
MacOS Catalina 10.15.5
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Anaconda 3.6
TensorFlow version (use command below):
unknown 2.0.0
Python version:
Python 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:
N/A
GPU model and memory:
Radeon Pro 560X / Intel UHD Graphics 630

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
When displaying a plot, then running model.fit, the following error is produced:
Train on 60000 samples
Epoch 1/5
OMP: Error #15: Initializing libiomp5.dylib, but found libiomp5.dylib already initialized.
OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results. For more information, please see http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/.
I have discovered two workarounds:

One workaround is described in this github issue # dmlc/xgboost#1715

import os
os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK'] = 'True'

The other is to remove any references to matplot lib code. I have included an example in my sample code below.

Describe the expected behavior
I would expect that leveraging matplotlib code and tensorflow code in the same script to work without any work aorunds.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

 Sorry for the late response. I ran your code in  and  and I don't see the code hangs when matplotlib in the same script. Please take a look at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/fcca315efc54b535ec23fa5380c2ca2a/untitled22.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
When I ran this code in GPU it took ~25 sec and in CPU it took ~110 sec.
Please verify once and close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!
