	<summary>Allow tf.image.extract_image_patches to work with complex numbers</summary>
	<description>
It would be nice if tf.image.extract_image_patches were extended to work with complex numbers as well.
I work extensively with audio data and after applying an STFT, I get a tensor of complex numbers. As I perform my training on patches from this tensor, it would be great if these patches could be extracted using tf.image.extract_image_patches.
I think this is something that would be valuable to many people working in the audio space.

		tf.image.extract_image_patches is quite useful and I used it before to create a sliding window effect. It makes sense to add full support for all common types.
Added a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/35962&gt;#35962&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for complex number support.
