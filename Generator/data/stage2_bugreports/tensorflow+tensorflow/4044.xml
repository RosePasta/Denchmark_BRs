	<summary>tf.import_graph_def: graph_def is invalid at node</summary>
	<description>
I've been trying to import a frozen graph into a new program, and do a simple forward pass, but tf.import_graph_def has been throwing a ValueError that I really can't make sense of.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: none
If installed from source, provide

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Copy the IPython Notebook from here
Change sample_prediction = tf.nn.softmax(tf.nn.xw_plus_b(sample_output, w, b)) to sample_prediction = tf.nn.softmax(tf.nn.xw_plus_b(sample_output, w, b), name="sample_prediction")
Modify the code like so:

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as session:
  tf.initialize_all_variables().run()
  print('Initialized')
  mean_loss = 0
  # code omitted (no changes)
  # new code below:
  saver = tf.train.Saver(tf.all_variables())
  saver.save(session, '/home/me/Documents/checkpoint.ckpt', write_meta_graph=False)
  tf.train.write_graph(graph.as_graph_def(), '/home/me/Documents', 'graph.pb')

Run, and verify that checkpoint.ckpt and graph.pb have been created
Run bazel build tensorflow/python/tools:freeze_graph &amp;&amp; bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph --input_graph=/home/me/Documents/graph.pb --input_checkpoint=/home/me/Documents/checkpoint.ckpt --output_graph=/home/me/Documents/frozen_graph.pb --output_node_names=sample_prediction
Verify that frozen_graph.pb has been created
Create a new IPython Notebook with the following code:

from __future__ import print_function
import os
import numpy as np
import random
import string
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.platform import gfile
import zipfile
from six.moves import range
from six.moves.urllib.request import urlretrieve

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
    with open('/home/me/Documents/frozen_graph.pb', "rb") as f:
        graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
        sample_prediction = tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name="", return_elements=['sample_prediction:0'])

Run

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Originally, the graph also contained a node named saved_sample_output, and when I tried importing that frozen graph, the error complained about saved_sample_output:0. I tried removing the name, re-writing the checkpoint and graph files, re-freezing, and re-running the code. It then complained about Variable_17:0, which, after checking graph.pb, was what had originally been named saved_sample_output. Other than that, I haven't been able to find anything else out.
Checked out #616 and looked at the solutions suggested for similar errors, but my import_graph_def never had an input map to begin with.
Removing the name parameter, or the return_elements parameter, or both, hasn't made a difference.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs or other output that would be helpful&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Come across a similar issue when import_graph_def(graph_def, name=""), any solution?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

My error was caused by an incorrect "graph.pb" which was saved by the following script, but I used a wrong [output_node]. So when I tried to import the "incorrect" graph, it gives me the error message above. Hope this helps in case anyone has made the same silly mistake as I.
from tensorflow.python.framework import graph_util
output_graph_def = graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(sess,graph_def,[output_node])
with tf.gfile.GFile('graph1.pb',"wb") as f:
f.write(output_graph_def.SerializeToString())

		I've encountered the same problem, using the example model from tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/learn/text_classification_character_cnn.py.
After greeze_graph and optimize_for_inference I got the error message:
ValueError: graph_def is invalid at node 'one_hot': Input tensor 'random_shuffle_queue_DequeueUpTo:1' not found in graph_def..
Only greeze_graph the loading the pb model works fine.

		It's possibly because you trained and freezed a model using an old version tensorflow, and then you want to import the graph using a new version one.
Try to keep tensorflow version consistency.

		This issue was created for an old TensorFlow version. If you still face the same problem with the new version, please file a new issue.

  I have maintained version consistency , but still i am not able to solve it
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit
Tensorflow - 1.4.0
So i have trained a model , froze it and performed optimization (&lt;denchmark-link:https://petewarden.com/2016/09/27/tensorflow-for-mobile-poets/&gt;https://petewarden.com/2016/09/27/tensorflow-for-mobile-poets/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) , graph transformation (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)  on tensorflow 1.4.0 but when it comes to quantization i face following error:
Graph_def is invalid at node u'ExpandDims': Input tensor 'image_ph:0' Cannot convert a tensor of type float32 to an input of type int32.
