	<summary>Improper output shape of DenseFeatures layer with numeric_column</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS 10.13.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): from pip I think, I don't remember and I don't know the difference
TensorFlow version: v1.12.0-10066-g5cbe8af8ed 2.0.0-dev20190313
Python version: 3.6.7

Describe the problem
I am using the  layer feeded with a feature  with a shape argument of . According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/numeric_column?hl=en&gt;the documentation of numeric_column&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the output tensor has shape [batch_size] + . My batch size is 2 and instead of having shape  as indicated by the documentation, my output tensor only has output shape of .
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem
Here is a minimal working example reproduccing the issue:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.data import Dataset
from tensorflow.feature_column import numeric_column
from tensorflow.keras.layers import DenseFeatures

raw_dataset = {'feature1': [[3., 4., 6.], [2., 12., 7.]]}
dataset = Dataset.from_tensor_slices(raw_dataset)
batch_size = 2
batched = dataset.batch(batch_size)
feature_column = numeric_column('feature1', shape=(3,1))
layer = DenseFeatures(feature_column)
for y in batched:
    pass
layer(y)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the output of which is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;tf.Tensor: id=19, shape=(2, 3), dtype=float32, numpy=
array([[ 3.,  4.,  6.],
       [ 2., 12.,  7.]], dtype=float32)&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		The output is correct, and this is not an issue. The &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/numeric_column?hl=en#args&gt;doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on   arg in  means the shape of input tensor to the column (indexed by the  arg), not the output one. You may check the docstring of the args  and  for more details.
