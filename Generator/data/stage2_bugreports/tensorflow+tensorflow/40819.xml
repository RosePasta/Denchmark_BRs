Maybe it's a version problem. You'd better install Python version 3.7。
Now I've solved that problem.

The problem is tensorflow-estimator==2.2.0！！！So uninstall it and retry install again.
conda uninstall tensorflow-estimator
conda install tensorflow-estimator==2.0.0
conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0
