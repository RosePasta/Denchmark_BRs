	<summary>Profile contains events with truncated names</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): RHEL 7.4
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Docker container
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.0.0-rc2-26-g64c3d38 2.0.0
Python version: 3.6.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0
GPU model and memory: K80

Describe the current behavior
When gathering a trace (via the supposedly only supported in TF2 method) the resulting trace file shows incomplete GPU op names. Validated in TensorBoard and deserializing the Protobuf message.
Examples:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;GpuDevice&gt;, long)
GpuDevice&gt;, int)
Dimension&lt;3&gt;, unsigned int*)
reduced_divisor)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Trace shows complete function names (at least) and signatures (optional) or even better: Layers to which those activities/events belong.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import datetime
import os
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds


def preprocess_for_mnist(image, label):
    image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0
    return image, label


datasets, info = tfds.load(name='mnist',
                           with_info=True,
                           as_supervised=True,
                           shuffle_files=False)

strategy = tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy(device='/gpu:0')

train_dataset = datasets['train'].map(preprocess_for_mnist).batch(32)

log_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~/tf_logs'),
                       datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32,
                               3,
                               activation='relu',
                               input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    callbacks = [
        tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir,
                                       histogram_freq=0,
                                       profile_batch=2)
    ]

    model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=2, steps_per_epoch=10, callbacks=callbacks)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I think the issue has already been fixed. The trace was collected on Oct 29th. Can you give us a trace at head, and we can investigate if the issue persists.

		I tried but can't test it currently.
I just tried with the docker containers but neither tensorflow-devel-gpu-py3 nor tensorflow-devel-py3 seem to actually contain tensorflow. In /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/ I see some Keras_* stuff but nothing with tensorflow. pip freeze doesn't list it either.
Using pip to install the 2.1.0rc has upgraded the CUDA requirement to 10.1 under which the driver requires admin rights or "unrestricted mode" to enable tracing. I passed it on to our HPC admins but it might take a bit.
