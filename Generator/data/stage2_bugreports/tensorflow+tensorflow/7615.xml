		Thanks for reporting this issue. I can reproduce it in 1.0.0 on Windows. It appears that this is because the core/debug module was not linked for the Windows cmake build (despite the fact that it is built for the Windows bazel build, but cmake is the one used in building the release binary). I'll fix it and the fix will be reflected in nightly builds and the next release. Sorry about the inconvenience it has caused.

		I am having this issue on Ubuntu 14.04 &amp; TF 0.12.1 (01/2017 version of Bitfusion Tensorflow AMI to be exact).

		TF debugger is only officially released with TF 1.0.
It not working with 0.12 version is expected.

 , can you confirm that you are experiencing this problem on Windows? The Windows-specific issue has been fixed in the master branch and the fix will be available in the next release (r1.1).

 , OK. Just realized that Bitfusion TensorFlow AMI is not Windows - it is Ubuntu Linux. Does the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 work for you? I'd like to rule out the possibility that the reason for the issue you are seeing is something specific to your model or the way you are using tfdbg.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python -m tensorflow.python.debug.examples.debug_mnist --debug
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Sorry for the false alarm. This only happened once. Second run for the exact same script ran seamlessly. Example works as well..

		TensorFlow 1.1.0rc0 has just come out. tfdbg should be working on Windows 7 and up now. Please give it a try.
Note: the default CLI of tfdbg on Linux and Mac uses curses. But there is no official curses support on Windows. So tfdbg CLI uses the less interactive readline on Windows, which does not have the mouse interaction and history navigation available on Linux and Mac.

		I am getting this same issue on TF 1.3.0, Fedora 25 64-bit installed from pip.
