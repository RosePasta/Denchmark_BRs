You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
tf.nn.fractional_max_pool aborts when pooling_ratio is negative in tf2.1. It throws segfault in nightly version.
Describe the expected behavior
Expect no crashes or aborts.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf
tf.nn.fractional_max_pool(value=tf.ones((1,1,1,1)), seed=1, pooling_ratio=-1)
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
Error message in TF2.1:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
Aborted (core dumped)
Error message in TF nightly:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Segmentation fault (core dumped)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is intended behavior..
Please, refer the document &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/fractional_max_pool#args&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.I i take value pooling ration =1 i am not seeing any issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/a37924989af91984416d6043aa64f0d2/untitled249.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

		Hi, I would like to work on this can anyone help me with how it should behave with pooling ratio&lt;1 as I am new in this.

  It should throw an exception instead of crash.

		So, mainly test pooling ratio to be&gt;=1 and throw error if it is not.

 I am not an expert, but some exception message thrown in python level would be good.

		I ran the code on nightly [2.4.0-dev20200916] and the issue still persist. please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/ecc94688daba6d6f4f7a73ce8923ae0d/untitled415.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
