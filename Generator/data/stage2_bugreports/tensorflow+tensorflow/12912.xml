	<summary>T-SNE Suddenly Not Working in Projector</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I'm sorry this isn't a technical question, but just this week I've noticed that T-SNE in the tensorboard projector is no longer clustering data properly. I am running the same vectors I did a few weeks ago, with the same perplexity. While before I saw distinct clusters, now the points are all forming an indistinct ball. Has anyone else noticed this?

		Hi HarryBaker,
Without a reproduction, this will be very hard to dig into. I recommend installing an older version of TensorFlow, and seeing if you can demonstrate that this is actually a bug in the TensorBoard projector. Since T-SNE is stochastic, you may have just gotten lucky the first time, or something else in the environment may have changed.
Also, this issue should be filed against &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&gt;http://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 rather than TensorFlow, since TensorBoard is its own project now. Please file there once you have a repro :)

		Ok, thanks for the link. You should redo the link on the projector page, since it goes to this repo.
