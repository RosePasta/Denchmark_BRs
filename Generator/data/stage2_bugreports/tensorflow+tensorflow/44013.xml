System information

Host OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
Tensorflow version (commit SHA if source): 261bc3a
Target platform (e.g. Arm Mbed OS, Arduino Nano 33 etc.): Any

Describe the problem
The download and extract script patches CMSIS source files to use qualified paths in order to be compatible with Arduino IDE build system. Currently it takes a significant amount of time, since there are many include files that need to be patched.
Ideally, there would be no need for patching CMSIS at all, but that would require to change the entire CMSIS repo to using qualified paths. Another solution could be to do the patching only when generating Arduino projects. However, that would most likely require us to patch the TFLu optimized op code (kernels/cmsis-nn/*) instead.
A short term solution is to optimize the patching algorithm.
Please provide the exact sequence of commands/steps when you ran into the problem
Any command running using TAGS="cmsis-nn". For example:
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile TAGS=cmsis-nn TARGET=sparkfun_edge person_detection_int8_bin
