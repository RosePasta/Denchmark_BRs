&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 includes an image, &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/images/Gather.png&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/images/Gather.png&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but this does not exist.  Gather.png doesn't seem to exist anywhere in the TF repository.

		I think this has already be fixed by this commit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c3ad6569611aac36fd2527030bf98fb8756919f&gt;7c3ad65&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Seems that the tensorflow.org does not update.

		Hi, the website still appears not to have been updated, and so the issue I reported still manifests.
Can we leave this open until the website is updated?  Or if there's a bug for the fact that we don't update the website frequently enough, I'd be OK dup'ing this to that one.
