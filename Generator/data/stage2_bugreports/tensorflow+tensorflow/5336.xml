		Just to be clear, how is this reproduced? Just importing tensorflow as
import tensorflow as tf
causes the problem?  This only occurs on Heroku? What version of Python?

 Yeah. So far the target platform I tested was only heroku. The python version is 2.7.10.

		Could you try the nightly build and also other older versions and see if we can narrow it down to just that build?
It looks like your version of Python does not have UCS4 unicode checked in, see e.g.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.python/9dThp1h3TMM&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.python/9dThp1h3TMM&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you do?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sys.maxunicode
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and see what it returns (see e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1446347/how-to-find-out-if-python-is-compiled-with-ucs-2-or-ucs-4&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1446347/how-to-find-out-if-python-is-compiled-with-ucs-2-or-ucs-4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		It looks like sys.maxunicode == 65535, which I would guess is UCS2.
I did try back to 0.11.0rc0 and saw the same issue. We've been running with a custom-compiled version, since we needed CUDA 8 support.
It's a little difficult to try a custom version without disrupting others' work, but I can try--we're running TF pretty much 24/7 now.

		I believe in general it is unlikely that our binary which is designed to work on Ubuntu will work on CentOS 7, because the build options on Python are possibly different between the two. Thus, on CentOS, you might need to use a custom built version. It appears CentOS7 and Ubuntu use different unicode options... &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gunan&gt;@gunan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 might know better.  You could probably build a custom python just for tensorflow if you want to use the Ubuntu binary, but that might just be asking for trouble.

		We never tested our binary with CentOS, therefore the distributed pip package has no guarantees.
As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aselle&gt;@aselle&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested, rebuilding from source, or using docker images on CentOS should work for you.
Not sure about heroku platform. Again, it is never tested.
Therefore no guarantees on it.

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aselle&gt;@aselle&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Heroku also returns 65535. For us it's not a big deal and we already switched to EC2. But it does look like a regression since  works.

		A quick google search showed that heroku instances are built on top of ubuntu 14.04.
Using docker, I tried the following:
$ docker run -it ubuntu:14.04 bash
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install python python-dev python-pip -y
$ pip install &lt;denchmark-link:https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

$ python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.)"
Which results in:
0.11.0rc2
Looks like in the stackoverflow question &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry&gt;@mrry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was able to root cause the problem and provide a solution for the platform in question.
However, since we do not have official support for this platform, and issue does not affect ubuntu version we are supporting, and the one before that, I will close this issue.
I am really sorry for the inconvenience, but looks like the solution for heroku and centOS is to build the pip package from sources.
