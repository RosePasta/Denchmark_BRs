	<summary>Error in the document of tf.keras.layers.Dense</summary>

Thank you for submitting a TensorFlow documentation issue. Per our GitHub
policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests, and
build/installation issues on GitHub.
The TensorFlow docs are open source! To get involved, read the documentation
contributor guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The tf.keras.layers.Dense can actually take input_shape as function input, but it is not shown in this document.
In addition, the example of this document has the function "Dense", but I tried on my Googlecolab and it is not defined in tensorflow2.

		Hi,
Thank you for your submission; I believe however that this is more of an issue with the understanding of how the docs are formatted rather than an actual issue with their content.

The tf.keras.layers.Dense can actually take input_shape as function input, but it is not shown in this document.

input_shape is one of the default keyword arguments inherited from the parent Layer class (just as dtype for example), which is why it is not explicitly documented for Dense class.

In addition, the example of this document has the function "Dense", but I tried on my Googlecolab and it is not defined in tensorflow2.

As in most documentation examples, imports are not explicitly displayed. To reproduce, you must run from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense (same thing with the Sequential class).

from tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.python.keras.models import Sequential
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, input_shape=(16,)))
model.add(Dense(32))

 As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pandrey-fr&gt;@pandrey-fr&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned, it is clear that this is not a docs issue, its more of the way it has been formatted. I am gonna close this issue as it has been resolved. Please add additional comments and we can open this issue again. Thanks!
