	<summary>Optimized arc kernels need to use the new TfLiteEvalTensor API</summary>
	<description>
The TFLM team recently ported all kernels except a handful of externally maintained optimized kernels. The new API enables very low memory overhead for TFLM. The primary change is the TfLiteTensor C struct is only available during TfLiteRegistration::Prepare for a kernel. Those structs are served under temporary memory and all data is only available during the lifetime of that method. All TFLM kernels should request the TfLiteEvalTensor C struct during TfLiteRegistration::Eval calls.
A sample change looks like this:

This issue tracks updating the Arc kernels to this new API.

PTAL - happy to review any PRs as they come in.
