	<summary>Tensorflow 1.5.0 Import Error on CUDA 9.0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No, I used the stock version.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip binary for windows with GPU support
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0
Python version: Python 3.6.1 from Anaconda
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0/7.0.5
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow as tf

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Installed CUDA/CUDNN 8.0/6, 9.0/7, 9.1/7
Used pip to install tensorflow_gpu 1.5.0
The installation process finished normally.
However, when import the module by "import tensorflow as tf", error messages raises and it says ImportError: Could not find 'cudart64_90.dll'.
I double checked the CUDA_PATH and PATH environmental variables to make sure that CUDA/CUDNN 9.0/7 are being used. Later I removed the 8.0/6 and 9.1/7, and the problem still exists.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ImportError: Could not find 'cudart64_90.dll'. TensorFlow requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH% environment variable. Download and install CUDA 9.0 from this URL: &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit&gt;https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		A system reboot solved the issue.
However, since the tensorflow installation page still refers to CUDA/CUDNN 8.0/6, it would be better if the page states the CUDA requirement for different versions of prebuilt binaries.

		The docs on the TensorFlow site have been updated. r1.5, r1.6, and master all include this commit now:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f68404bdd10a4b6ef2a50439efac4614de024636&gt;f68404b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks so much! I've tried dozens of ways for hours. A system reboot finally solved everything.
