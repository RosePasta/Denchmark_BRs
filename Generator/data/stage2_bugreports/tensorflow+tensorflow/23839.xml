System information

TensorFlow version:
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/performance/overview#comparing_compiler_optimizations


The following section has been removed from official documentation:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/performance/overview#comparing_compiler_optimizations&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/performance/overview#comparing_compiler_optimizations&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I was able to find the benchmark after long search here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/13050#issuecomment-330699371&gt;#13050 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I was wondering if the section was removed deliberately or by accident?
Regards, Anton
