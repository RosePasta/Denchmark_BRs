You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

		Thanks for the report Since TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers is experimental and continually evolving, you should use the latest code at HEAD rather than checking out a particular branch.
In the latest code, download_dependencies.sh is deprecated (with a warning message), since all required dependencies are downloaded by the makefile. Let me know if there's some documentation that instructed you to use download_dependencies.sh, so we can update it.

		Oh. Yes. That would be &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_rpi&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_rpi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Sadly building from HEAD is also broken (at least for rpi armv6).
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32055#issuecomment-525857017&gt;#32055 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Also default (armv7l) rpi build is broken at HEAD: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32055#issuecomment-525862626&gt;#32055 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Apologies, I misread the paths and thought this was in reference to TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (as opposed to TF Lite generally). In that case, I take back my previous comment!

, it looks like this mirror URL is no longer working:

		edit download_dependencies.sh, then change 'http.*bitbucket.org' to 'https.*bitbucket.org', It worked;

		URLs are all updated. Let me close this.
Please, feel free to reopen if the problem still exists.
