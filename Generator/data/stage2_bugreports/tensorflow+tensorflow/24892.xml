What does "Transient arrays with strings are not supported yet" means? What should I modify in my model?

		I have the same issue too. Any updates?

		I am testing on a more simplified graph and the error disappears.
But I still want to know what caused the error and what does the error message means.

 what did you change in your graph to fix it?

		Remove most of OPs. Almost leaving only convolution and basic math/logic OPs.
That's why I don't know where the error was.

		Strings aren't fully supported by TensorFlow Lite. I recommend testing your original model with the tf-nightly since it's some thing we are actively working on. If your original model doesn't work with the latest nightly, can you provide your model (or a minimal model that reproduces the error) along with the command you used to try and convert that model.

 who is working on adding support for HashTables (which is related to general string support).

		I'm seeing that you are still using tensorflow/contrib/lite/toco, probably you can update your tf repo to the latest and test if that helps. Also, a minimum model to reproduce the issue might be useful to debug. Thanks.

		Thank you for helping.
I gave up using tflite due to lack of  OP supports.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
