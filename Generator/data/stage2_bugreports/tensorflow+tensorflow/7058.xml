		There should not be a tf.python.ops.seq2seq. The public API defines tf.nn.seq2seq.

		but I found these two imports in two projects, this is why I got confused

		I think this maybe caused by the difference of the tensorflow version. In the version 12, the later is not available

		Thanks @KeyYD for checking. Right, to re-iterate, tf.nn.seq2seq is the valid one among the two.

		Is this right? It seems like tf.nn.seq2seq is again deprecated as well? What's the new API?

		We weren't confident that seq2seq was ready -- its API is still changing. it's in tf.contrib.seq2seq.
