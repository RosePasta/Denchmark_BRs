You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
when I add multiple tensors with shape (), tf.keras.layers.Add complains that

File "/home/xieyi/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/engine/base_layer.py", line 680, in call
self._maybe_build(inputs)
File "/home/xieyi/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/engine/base_layer.py", line 1905, in _maybe_build
self.build(input_shapes)
File "/home/xieyi/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/utils/tf_utils.py", line 299, in wrapper
output_shape = fn(instance, input_shape)
File "/home/xieyi/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/layers/merge.py", line 95, in build
batch_sizes = [s[0] for s in input_shape if s is not None]
File "/home/xieyi/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/layers/merge.py", line 95, in 
batch_sizes = [s[0] for s in input_shape if s is not None]
IndexError: tuple index out of range

Describe the expected behavior
I expect tf.keras.layers.Add can process tensors of any dimension.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
#!/usr/bin/python3

import tensorflow as tf;

a = tf.constant(1);
b = tf.constant(2);
c = tf.constant(3);
d = tf.keras.layers.Add()([a,b,c]);
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
