	<summary>Impossible to use tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint in distributed training</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0

Describe the current behavior
It is not possible to use tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint in distributed training:
RuntimeError: add_update was called in a cross-replica context. This is not expected. If you require this feature, please file an issue.

See &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11CmG16-x9z-MMKoSeKaEKZ0zrnBdeMMV&gt;this Colab notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Note: no error if we use  instead of TF checkpoint format. However, just a few hours ago, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/karmel&gt;@karmel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jvishnuvardhan&gt;@jvishnuvardhan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34016&gt;recommended me to use TF format&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (because  can cause issues, okay fine). So, which one should I use finally? None is working? I am lost...

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/netw0rkf10w&gt;@netw0rkf10w&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, sorry about the confusion. I was trying to repro locally with your example, but unfortunately there was some issue downloading the dataset. When I tried some other dataset I have the program could finish just fine. Would you mind providing a minimal repro with some dummy data so I can quickly repro? Thank you.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rchao&gt;@rchao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Could you tell me what kind of issues did you have? I have just tested again and there was no issue with the download of data.
Note that in the notebook, I created the dataset and fit the model in the same code cell, so maybe the error you got was from the training part and not from the dataset download part. For clarity, I have split them into different cells. Please try it again. Thanks.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/netw0rkf10w&gt;@netw0rkf10w&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, sorry for the late response. I made a copy of your updated colab and used nightly instead:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;%tensorflow_version 2.x
!pip uninstall -y -q tensorflow
!pip install -U -q tf-nightly
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and it could work fine without the problem. Can you take a look if that fixes your issue? The TF version I verified to work at is 2.1.0-dev20191202.
