	<summary>[ko] Notebooks out of sync</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
Please sync the ko notebooks to the source of truth notebooks using the nb_code_sync tool here( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/blob/master/tools/nb_code_sync.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/blob/master/tools/nb_code_sync.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
Currently, many of them are failing.

 I think the community could benefit from more explicit guidance. Which notebooks? And do you know why? It seems odd a bunch started failing since their haven't been any new merges this week.

		The builds have been failing for a long time. I am increasing the timeout for those, but for example style_transfer still has mentions of tensorflow.contrib.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.contrib'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.contrib'

+ delete_or_move site/ko/tutorials/generative/style_transfer.ipynb
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I can get you the list of notebooks that fail, but it would still be nice to sync atleast all the guides and tutorials directory since some of the code has been updated there.
A notebook working is not indicative of the latest code being in them. It can continue to work due to TF's backward compatibility guarantees.

 Sorry if this is a basic question, but is there a systematized way of making sure that our code base is in sync? Reviewers can take a look once in a while, but I feel like doing so manually is ineffective and creates room for error.

		Yup, you can use the nb_code_sync tool.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jaketae&gt;@jaketae&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Nothing automated across the entire code base. We get notifications when a notebook breaks but, as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yashk2810&gt;@yashk2810&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned, it may still contain out-of-date code that happens to work.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/blob/master/tools/nb_code_sync.py&gt;nb_code_sync.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is useful for detecting when  are out of sync with the  source. It's far from perfect, but has been used successfully by the community (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/117&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Install deps:
$ pip3 install -U absl-py

$ ./tools/nb_code_sync.py --src=../docs/site/en/notebook.ipynb \
    ./site/&lt;lang&gt;/notebook.ipynb
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thank you very much for the pointers! &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/blob/master/tools/nb_code_sync.py&gt;nb_code_sync.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seems like a great handle little tool to better maintain the notebooks we have at the moment. I'll definitely take a look and try using it myself (perhaps starting with ).

 Apologies for the delay, I got carried away by other things yesterday. I just ran the command
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python ./tools/nb_code_sync.py site/ko/tutorials/generative/style_transfer.ipynb --site_root ../docs/site/en --src ../docs/site/en/tutorials/generative/style_transfer.ipynb
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but was returned with this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error: Notebooks must have same amount of code cells to sync between.
Please manually compare the source and destination notebooks.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So it seems like the way to go about this would be to manually go back and forth to check if the notebooks are in sync. I can definitely do that, but before I begin engaging in some menial work, I was wondering if this would be the optimal way to navigate this issue.
Thank you again for the help!

 I'm not well-acquainted with how Swift notebooks are maintained. Should this be added as an instruction on README for community translators?

Yes, there is a note in README: "S4TF 노트북은 꼭 출력 결과가 포함되어야 합니다" :)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jaketae&gt;@jaketae&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes, unfortunately the nb_code_sync tool assumes the same amount of code cells in both source and translation notebook. If they don't match, that probably indicates the translation is quite out of date.
I'll think about better ways to automate this. I could make sure cell metadata is the same across both notebooks, but we haven't enforced that.
