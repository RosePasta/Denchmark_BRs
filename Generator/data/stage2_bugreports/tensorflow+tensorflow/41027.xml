	<summary>AutoGraph could not transform with "Cause: Inconsistent ASTs detected" with pymc4</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):

Yes, with pymc4


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):

Ubuntu 16.04 on WSL (WSL1)
Windows version : Windows 10 1909 (18363.900)


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

binary


TensorFlow version (use command below):

v1.12.1-35610-gd8c49c2fde 2.4.0-dev20200701


Python version:

Python 3.8.3, built from source


CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

No GPU



Describe the current behavior
When I execute a script which uses pymc4, TF writes logs which says:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING:tensorflow:AutoGraph could not transform &lt;function _convert_function_call.&lt;locals&gt;.f at 0x7f2d04ec3f70&gt; and will run it as-is.
Please report this to the TensorFlow team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, `export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10`) and attach the full output.
Cause: Inconsistent ASTs detected. This is a bug. Cause: 
inconsistent values for field args: [&lt;gast.gast.Name object at 0x7f2d04d7b370&gt;] and []Diff:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
The script runs without the warning log from TF.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue

Install pymc4 with pip install pymc4

This will also install TF


Run this script


The log is available on &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Isa-rentacs/72ca156134a172d56cbe4ae5da827003&gt;this gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
