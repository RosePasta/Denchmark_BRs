	<summary>native python logging broken with TF 1.14</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian 9.0 stretch
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-2376-gf5ce1c00d4 1.14.0-rc0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0/7.6
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA Titan X (Pascal) 12Gb

Describe the current behavior
logging from the python's standard library stopped working in TF 1.14. Log file is not created and the output supposed to be written there is instead redirected to the stdout, which results in each logging message appear twice in the console.
Describe the expected behavior
When run on TF 1.12 , log.txt is created and the logging is being recorded correctly.
Code to reproduce the issue
import logging
import tensorflow as tf


def main(_):
    FORMAT = '%(asctime)-15s %(message)s'
    logging.basicConfig(filename='log.txt', filemode='w',
                        datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S',
                        level=logging.INFO, format=FORMAT)
    console = logging.StreamHandler()
    console.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    logging.getLogger('').addHandler(console)

    sess = tf.Session()

    logging.info("test write")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    tf.app.run()
This yields the following output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2019-06-16 17:54:24.047410: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1326] Created TensorFlow device (/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 with 10711 MB memory) -&gt; physical GPU (device: 0, name: TITAN X (Pascal), pci bus id: 0000:04:00.0, compute capability: 6.1)
I0616 17:54:24.051054 140454010144128 test_logging.py:15] test write
test write
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Notice that test write appears twice in the output. And log.txt is not created. When run with TF 1.12 this code snippets behaves as expected.

		I could able to reproduce the above mentioned issue with tensorflow 1.14.0-rc0 on colab. Thanks!

		Similar problem here, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gadagashwini&gt;@gadagashwini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Just importing tensorflow intrusively adds a logging handler to the root logger:
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    logger.warning("Hi!")

(stderr)&gt;&gt;&gt;
Hi!
vs
import logging

import tensorflow as tf

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    logger.warning("Hi!")

(stderr)&gt;&gt;&gt;
WARNING: Logging before flag parsing goes to stderr.
W0628 20:51:13.387141 140355075146048 test.py:9] Hi!
This is due to absl adding its own handler to the root logger when importing tensorflow.

		Having dug a bit more, I have found the reason for this issue. Compare the difference between  in 1.13 and 1.14:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.13/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.13/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.14/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.14/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have traced the unwanted addition of an ABSLHandler down to this import in 1.14:



tensorflow/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py


         Line 23
      in
      f98fa7b






 from absl.app import run as _run

		Just a quick ping to say that my work is also affected by this.

		Closing as duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26691&gt;#26691&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
See that bug for more, but TL;DR: upstream absl logging might be a touch too magical, but you can disable it.
