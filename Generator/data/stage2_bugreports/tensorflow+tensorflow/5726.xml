	<summary>Don't imply top_k is nondifferentiable</summary>

 is in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/nn.html#evaluation&gt;Evaluation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 section of the documentation, which says

The evaluation ops are useful for measuring the performance of a network. Since they are
nondifferentiable, they are typically used at evaluation time.

This is confusing, since  is differentiable.  Pointed out by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nmduc&gt;@nmduc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hello, it looks like the latest docs (API r0.12) still has the old documentation that implies that  is non-differentiable.  See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/nn/evaluation&gt;docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		They are fixed at HEAD: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/nn/evaluation&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/nn/evaluation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
