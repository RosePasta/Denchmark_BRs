	<summary>A commit message should be "unit64"</summary>
	<description>
In the commit message: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4be466a87efc152a8581febe7c1deaae562465af#diff-f0675f2568ff9470bcfc1f2bc79c5386&gt;4be466a#diff-f0675f2568ff9470bcfc1f2bc79c5386&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I find that it said "int64". But when I check the API documentation, it seems that it should be "unit64". Please look at parameter description: TF2.3:&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

TF2.2:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.2/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.2/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zjzh&gt;@zjzh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I'm having trouble trying to figure out what exactly you are talking about. Are you trying to say that the function  should not support non-negative ints as a ?

		Hi  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Harsh188&gt;@Harsh188&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,  thanks for your reply.
Yes, it should support. But the commit message say: "and support int64.", which seems that it does not support the int64 in past. But if we check the documentation changes: TF2.3:&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

TF2.2: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.2/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.2/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
__. We can see that the "x" parameter description add " uint64". The information is inconsistent with API documentation. If the information of commit message is wrongly writes "and support int64", it should be "and support uint64".

 Sorry for my delayed response.
Don't worry too much about the details of a commit message. I just checked bincount, it still raises an error if you input an array which contains negative elements.
The message does not try to indicate that arrays with negative values will be supported. I think this issue can be closed.

		Thanks. If the docs are accurate then we can close this.

, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, Thanks for your explanation. It makes me understand that developers could make it support more data types but does not mean that it support negative elements.
However, I am confused about whether there is the  inconsistency between commits and documentation, commits and code changes. Specifically, you know, the difference of TF 2.2 &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.2/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod__&gt;"tf.Variable.mod"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and TF 2.3&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable#__mod__&gt;"tf.Variable.mod"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is that "x" parameter description is add "uint64". When I check the commit messages about the change, I localize the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4be466a87efc152a8581febe7c1deaae562465af#diff-f0675f2568ff9470bcfc1f2bc79c5386&gt;commit &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  that shows that  the documentation added the description "uint64". However, the commit message make me confuse because the commit message is "int64". Therefore, I want to know that whether the description of documentation is inconsistent with the commit message or or something.
