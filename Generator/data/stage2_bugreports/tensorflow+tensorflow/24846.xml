installation with gpu is very difficult. could you please publish a one-command script that does the whole process? see a list of the steps here (i wrote them):

		Unfortunately, a lot of the GPU dependencies we have are through NVIDIA.
Some of these components require you to read and review and their licenses.
Installing through their repositories will imply these.
I am not sure if we can redistribute, or hide their installation.
For these, I have to redirect you to NVIDIA.
Moreover, while those instructions will work for ubuntu, on redhat, or windows they are completely different. even different ubuntu versions can require completely different commands for different steps.
So unfortunately, not sure we can provide a one script to install everything that solves the problem for everyone, even if we can.

		I will close the issue, but thanks for the document!
It will still be discoverable through search, and I am sure it will be very helpful to users.
