	<summary>problem with wide_n_deep_tutorial.py on Tensorflow 1.0</summary>

Using Python 3.6.0 (Anaconda x64), Tensorflow 1.0, macOS Sierra version 10.12.4, I get the following error:

		Thanks for pointing this out. It seems that the tutorial code on the website is linking to the latest version instead of the version compatible with release 1.0.
Could you try with the tutorial version from the 1.0 branch?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/examples/learn/wide_n_deep_tutorial.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/examples/learn/wide_n_deep_tutorial.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'll try to look into how to make sure that the links in the website point to the appropriate release branch.
