	<summary>Small mistake in tensorflow document on the website</summary>
	<description>
I don't know whether it's right to report documents mistakes in this place,i don't find other place to report mistakes...
On tensorflow's website, in the Custom Model section of Getting started with tensorflow page it's mentioned as -
tf.contrib.learn.LinearRegressor is actually a sub-class of tf.contrib.learn.LinearRegressor.
Isn't it supposed to be tf.contrib.learn.LinearRegressor is actually a sub-class of tf.contrib.learn.Estimator ?

		Yes, that is a mistake. Thanks for reporting it. I'll submit a fix, but it will likely take a bit for it to make its way onto the web page.
