	<summary>Can not run  ./build_ios_universal_lib.sh</summary>
	<description>
According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_ios&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_ios&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I am running tensorflow/lite/tools/make/build_ios_universal_lib.sh. However, when I run it, it gives me the error:
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
"tflite::ResourceVariable::~ResourceVariable()", referenced from:
tflite::Interpreter::~Interpreter() in benchmark-lib.a(interpreter.o)
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make: *** [/Users/broccoli/Downloads/tensorflow-master/tensorflow/lite/tools/make/gen/ios_x86_64/bin/benchmark_model] Error 1
Is there any way to fix this error?

		I'm getting a similar issue with the build_ios_universal_lib.sh:

		Sorry for the late update to this issue.
The build_ios_universal.sh is being deprecated, and the new recommended way of building the TFLite for iOS is using bazel instead.
Could you follow the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_ios&gt;recently updated build guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and see if that works for you?
