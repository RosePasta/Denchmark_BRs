	<summary>tf.estimator Quickstart web doc needs syncing with GitHub</summary>
	<description>
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.11.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): conda-forge
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.3
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: Copy and paste code sample and run on a Jupter Notebook. The code sample on GitHub works (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/get_started/estimator.md). The code sample on Tensorflow documentation doesn't (https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator). My guess is that the web documentation requires "syncing" with Github version?

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is regarding (possibly out-dated) web documentation not "synced" with the correct GitHub version.

The code sample on Tensorflow documentation doesn't run on Python 3.6 / TensorFlow v1.3 (https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator).
The code sample on GitHub works (probably more up to date)
(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/get_started/estimator.md).

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If you copy and paste the code sample from web documentation and run on a Jupter notebook, you get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AttributeError: module 'urllib' has no attribute 'urlopen'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(this has been addressed in GitHub repo sample code. Just not the web doc).
Also, the line that reads (for both training and test):
with open(IRIS_TRAINING, "w") as f:
should be corrected to:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;with open(IRIS_TRAINING, "wb") as f:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(again, this has been addressed in GitHub repo sample code. Just not the web doc).
So possible just need a refresh of the code sample on the web doc?
i.e. replace the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/estimator&gt;current web doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/get_started/estimator.md&gt;GitHub doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
Thanks!

		The docs refer to the most recent stable branch. So I'm guessing the recent stable branch (1.3) has a bug it. Your workaround used master where the bug was fixed. Release 1.4 seems to be forthcoming shortly which would address this.

 : Yeah, I think this will be addressed with the next website refresh.

		I just had a look at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/&gt;tensorflow version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 page - it says:

The docs at root (i.e. in tensorflow.org/api_docs) refer to the most recent stable branch (in this case, r1.2).

This probably explains it. Though I guess it "might" be a good idea to highlight at the top of web documentation on this? I have a gut feeling a chunk of new comers would have tensorflow v1.3 installed, while using the v1.2 web documentation.)
I presume this will belong to a "feature request" bucket so will leave this trial open for now.
Thanks!

		Hi,
Thanks for reporting this.
I've updated the master docs, which fixed this problem:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/estimator&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/estimator&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Also: 1.3 is the current stable branch. It's that 'versions' page is wrong -&gt; fixed.
