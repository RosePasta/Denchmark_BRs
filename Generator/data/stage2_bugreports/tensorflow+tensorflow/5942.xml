	<summary>Update Cmake README Doc Reflecting 0.12r</summary>
	<description>
Now with 0.12r would be interesting to update Readme as current status, instructions or simply reference the release?

 Do you think updating the current status for officially supported and the current limitations leaving the CMake build instructions is fine?
If that looks good to you I'd be happy to submit a PR with those changes at first and update with your feedback.

		I am closing this as I think it won't be relevant with the 0.12 release info available. I thought about adding pip instructions to cmake doc at the day after it came out submitting &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/6002&gt;#6002&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but isn't necessary.
