	<summary>Model size reduction in set_weights()</summary>
	<description>
I have used tf.Keras for training and then transferred weights to another model with the help of get_weights() and set_weights(). After saving the weights from the original to another model I have seen that there is the model size reduction of 3 times smaller.
Any idea why this is happening.
