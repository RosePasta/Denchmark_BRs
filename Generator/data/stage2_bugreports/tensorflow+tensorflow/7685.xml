	<summary>Image problems in Tensorflow documentation at tensorflow.org, Error 404</summary>
	<description>
I'm not sure I should put the issue here. But when I clicked "Issue tracker" on tensorflow.org, it redirects me here.
I realized that the directory structure for TF documentation has changed a lot for TF 1.0 on &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org&gt;http://www.tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Now there are problems for web pages with images, like &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/segment_max?hl=bn&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/segment_max?hl=bn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. A 404 error is reported while loading the images.

		it's an issue with how we now have python docs in api_docs/python/tf/whatever but they all refer to "../../images/" -- the proper directory is tensorflow.org/images rather than tensorflow.org/api_docs/images.  Not sure whether to fix in docstring or site generation scripts but we'll get it done one way or the other.
