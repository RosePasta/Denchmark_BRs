	<summary>voice activity detection implementation</summary>
	<description>
I found that voice activity detection is implemented in the paper "Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting Using Deep Neural Networks". But I did not find anything related to voice activity detection in the paper "Convolutional Neural Networks for Small-footprint Keyword Spotting".
My question is that is voice activity detection implemented in this code or not?

 Please provide the link for the paper mentioned here. Is this related to tensorflow.org website?

		The paper title is "Convolutional Neural Networks for Small-footprint Keyword Spotting" and link is &lt;denchmark-link:https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43969.pdf&gt;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43969.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. This paper is implemented in Speech Commands Example and Link is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
My question is that is voice activity detection implemented in this code or not?

 Were you able to detect voice activity using tensorflow lite?

		Yes, it has been implemented in this code. The instructions are &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/sequences/audio_recognition.md&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
You can also use this with TFLite micro. (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech/train&gt;training&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
The only issue is that it uses TensorFlow 1 (and not the latest TensorFlow 2 version), otherwise the code should work as per the instructions provided.
