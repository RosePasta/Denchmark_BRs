Describe the documentation issue
If you try to execute this code in a python REPL, it fails at
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'logging'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
Depends on how you want it. As of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it seems the logging API does not exist. Of the methods in &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35911252/disable-tensorflow-debugging-information&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35911252/disable-tensorflow-debugging-information&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, only
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2' 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

worked.

 Those examples are not related to TF2.0. Those examples uses Tensorflow master(TF1.13.1).
In the example, import tensorflow as tf was used. For 2.0 we need to use, tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0. Thanks!

 : thank you for the explanation. This is a course about Tensorflow 2.0. I had only installed the 2.0 version on my system, which is why  used 2.0. Anyways, it seems to be a non-issue if this is simply not supposed to work in 2.0.

		I am closing this issue as tf.logging is not there in TF2.0. Thanks!

		I fixed this in all the examples I could find:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import logging
logger = tf.get_logger()
logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
