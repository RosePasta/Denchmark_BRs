&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The last line of this guide produces a bug when ran on the associated colab notebook (maybe everywhere, I haven't checked).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Raises listed and defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are there currently visuals? If not, will it clarify the content?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No, I'm only beginning in TF/Keras :)

 Thanks for trying TF Keras colab. I was able to execute the colab successfully as is. Are you changing any parameter or using different TF version in the colab?

		I've checked again, the issue was that by habit I used a GPU in colab. Maybe it's not a bug anymore then? I don't really know, but you should be able to reproduce the exception by choosing a GPU as the hardware accelerator.

		I see. You have to install TF-gpu to use gpu accelerator. Closing this issue since it's not a bug and works in colab (without hardware accelerator). Thanks!
