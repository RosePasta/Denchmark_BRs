 It is strange. I know you are trying to access tutorials page. Tutorials page should look like this &lt;denchmark-link:https://screenshot.googleplex.com/DMWAtBAQvkx&gt;https://screenshot.googleplex.com/DMWAtBAQvkx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Could you tell from which region (Asia, Europe, America etc) your are accessing TF website?
Are you using Chrome? Could you check the same page using others (IE,Firefox, Safari etc)
Do you see similar things in other pages. Could you share a screenshot.
Thanks!

Absolutely.


I access tensorflow.org from China.
Yes, the browser is Chrome. And this page display the same error no matter browser I use.
The same error is happened in https://developers.google.com/ and any sub-page of tensorflow.org.
Here are the screenshots.

 Does this happen when you access the site through tensorflow.google.cn ? Do you have any JavaScript blockers on?

 No matter tensorflow.google.cn or tensorflow.org, I encountered the same error. And I have turned the  blockers off. For that I did't misjudge, I have tried to access these website through other browsers, such as Firefox and Microsoft Edge which have no type of plug-ins.

		This seems related to how webfonts from fonts.googleapis.com are blocked in China.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Whisht&gt;@Whisht&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you try this again? Testing thinks you have a Chrome extension installed that is blocking Google web fonts.

.
Seems to be an issue with Google Fonts getting blocked. Assuming you're using a VPN to access tensorflow.org or using tensorflow.google.cn, these resources should be available. There may be something at the ISP-level going on.
SInce there doesn't seem like much we can do, closing this issue for now. We can re-examine if there are more reports.
Thank you for your help and will keep an eye on it.
