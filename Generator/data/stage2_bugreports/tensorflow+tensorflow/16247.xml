	<summary>[doc][feature request] Graphical representation of operations</summary>
	<description>
It would be cool if the documentation of TF operations would contain graphical examples.
E.g. the "tf.dynamic_partition" operation contains such a visualization:

This would be especially helpful to understand the different slicing/joining operations.

		I agree this would be really cool. Often it is hard to do for higher dimensional tensors. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wolffg&gt;@wolffg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, has anyone looked intothis?  It would be especially useful for things like conv as well (though there are sources of those).

		We are always on the hunt for contributions to the API docs!  If you have images you want to contribute, make a PR with the images, and we'll pull them into our image hosting system.
Agreed that many of these ops (such as space-to-depth and depth-to-space) could use more visuals, plus probably more code.  Restating it so the task has bounds, we'd say that all the ops in this section should have images:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/array_ops#Slicing_and_Joining&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/array_ops#Slicing_and_Joining&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

which is ~30 ops that don't have images.  I don't think I can close this with a quick change, so I'm setting this to "contributions welcome" and we'll track this suggestion internally as part of our ongoing API docs work.
