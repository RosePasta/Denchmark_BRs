Operating System: macOS Sierra 10.12.3
The version of virtualenv is 15.1.0
issue like these:
admindeMacBook-Air:~ admin$ virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow
Using base prefix '//anaconda'
New python executable in /Users/admin/tensorflow/bin/python
dyld: Library not loaded: @loader_path/../lib/libpython3.5m.dylib

I have tried many ways like homebrew, upgrade py, but it does not work at all.

		Hi,
I guess you have to choose either of the following according to your python version.


Also, please try these links,
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/2554&gt;#2554&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I tried
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 targetDirectory # for Python 3.5
and the issue changed:
OSError: [Errno 62] Too many levels of symbolic links: '/Users/admin/targetDirectory/bin/python'
what should I do next? I tried to remove other files /Users/admin/targetDirectory/bin/python but it still not work.

		Hi,
Did you tried the links? Also, please execute first rm -rf env to remove old virtual environment file.

 this looks like a virtualenv problem and not a TensorFlow problem, but if this is a common problem we might need to update our virtualenv install docs. If you think this should work for most people feel free to close and redirect to a different forum.

Here is what happens when I run Step 3 of Installing TensorFlow on macOS:

		I had similar problems. Looks like virtualenv builds it's version of python from the one that is used to run the set up script. Just updated to the latest V3 Python from &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.python.org/downloads/&gt;https://www.python.org/downloads/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 closed the terminal (no idea if I needed to do this or not - habit!) deleted the junk from the old install attempts and ran again - flew straight through.
Hope that helps someone.

		If you are still struggling, and experiencing this issue:
ERROR: virtualenv is not compatible with this system or executable
Have you tried installing virtualenv with conda and trying again?
conda install virtualenv
