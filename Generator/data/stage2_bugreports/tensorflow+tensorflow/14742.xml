	<summary>foldl and foldr gives different results on gpu vs cpu in tensorflow 1.4</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): - Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): - Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): - source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.4.0-3-g5addbae, 1.4.0
Python version:  2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source):  0.7.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: default
GPU model and memory: 1080ti (11GB)
Exact command to reproduce:
See code below

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

While testing foldl and foldr, I get the expected result when run on cpu, but get a zero result when running on gpu.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import tensorflow as tf
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
els = tf.constant([1.0,2.0,3.0])
f = tf.foldl(lambda a, x: a + x, els)
with tf.Session() as sess:
print tf.GIT_VERSION,tf.VERSION
print sess.run([els,f])
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Result:
v1.4.0-3-g5addbae 1.4.0
[array([ 1.,  2.,  3.], dtype=float32), 0.0]
The last number should be 6.0, ie the sum of the input array.  I get this if I change the device to /cpu:0

		Testing further, this seems to be related to this error message:
tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:936] failed to allocate 72.44M (75956224 bytes) from device: CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY
It looks like a memory error happens, but this does not cause the task to fail.  It just causes in incorrect result.
I would suggest that it is better that the job fail than have a wrong answer

 do you have the stack trace? It should definitely propagate up.

		There is no error thrown to the client, just a incorrect answer, so no stack trace.
