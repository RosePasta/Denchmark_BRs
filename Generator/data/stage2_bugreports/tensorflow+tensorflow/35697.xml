	<summary>tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.CancelledError: Cancelled, When do distributed training with parameter-server</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 14.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.13.2
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.20.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 4.8.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: no CUDA
GPU model and memory: no GPU

Describe the current behavior
When do distribute training using parameter-server strategy, there are some workers failed with the information tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.CancelledError: Cancelled occasionally.
There is no more information, so I have no idea how to debug the error. Is there anyone has seen this error or how to debug?  appreciate your kind help.
Code to reproduce the issue
It's an occasional problem, so it's not easy to reproduce.
