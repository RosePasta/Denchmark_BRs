	<summary>Tensorflow 2.x version is used in 1.x Tutorials</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue: https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/keras/save_and_restore_models.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing): The Tutorials corresponding to 1.x Version in Github has the version 2.x used inside it, thus leaving no Tutorials corresponding to 1.x (at least for Save and Restore)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description: Please find the screenshot in this link.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Correct links&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is the link to the source code correct? : Yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Parameters defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are all parameters defined and formatted correctly? : N/A
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Returns defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are return values defined? : N/A
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Usage example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is there a usage example? : No, usage example for Save and Restore is not present for Tensorflow 1.x version
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Request visuals, if applicable&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are there currently visuals? If not, will it clarify the content? : N/A
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?: No&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are you planning to also submit a pull request to fix the issue? See the docs

		I'd like to work on this issue. But is this really a doc related issue?? Cause I think the changes involve migrating the code to tf-1.x from 2.x.

		I cannot open the screenshot link. Can you upload the image on imgur instead? t is leading me to a Google Sign Page, and no matter how many times I open my account, it keeps looping back.

		Should we create a new folder specifically for archives and examples for Tensorflow 2.x as well? Like we have docs/site/en/r1/ for TensorFlow 1.x?
I'm willing to open up a new issue for it.

 I guess yes because that file which is mentioned is in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/master/site/en/r1&gt;/docs/site/en/r1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which basically has a README which says:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TensorFlow 1.x
This archive of the TensorFlow 1.x docs is in maintenance mode only.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi,  this is somewhat intentional. These run in tensorflow2's compatibility-mode.
I'll add a note to all of them explaining.

,
Thank you for your response. If I interpret your comment correctly, it means that the 1.x tutorials will be made 2.x compatible. Does it mean  will be deprecated and there will be no Tutorials corresponding to , which uses  inside the Code?

Yes we want to move away from TF1. But we're keeping this r1 snapshot as is for the foreseeable future.
They run with colab's tf2 installation, but if you use tf1 compatibility mode:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tf.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It should make (almost) no difference whether you actually have tf1 or tf2 installed.
There are some tf.Session in these old tutorials. We hav e no plans to delete them, we just discourage anyone from writing code this way.
