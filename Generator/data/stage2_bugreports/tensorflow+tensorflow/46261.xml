	<summary>different TFLM builds use the same output directory.</summary>

In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/46242#discussion_r553049656&gt;#46242 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I was suggesting that the linker was not correctly dropping unused symbols.
In fact, what was very likely happening was that I did not do a make clean between switching to BUILD_TYPE=release. And since the TFLM makefile currently uses the same directory for all BUILD_TYPE, only the modified files were being rebuilt with the smaller release build.
We can reproduce this with the following sequence of commands:
First check what the binary size is for the release build.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile clean

make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile -j8 TARGET=xtensa OPTIMIZED_KERNEL_DIR=xtensa TARGET_ARCH=hifimini XTENSA_CORE=mini1m1m_RG keyword_benchmark BUILD_TYPE=release

xt-size tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/gen/xtensa_hifimini/bin/keyword_benchmark 
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  46080	  40204	  24952	 111236	  1b284	tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/gen/xtensa_hifimini/bin/keyword_benchmark
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Next have some intermediate non-release objects and then do a release build:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile clean

# build non-release
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile -j8 TARGET=xtensa OPTIMIZED_KERNEL_DIR=xtensa TARGET_ARCH=hifimini XTENSA_CORE=mini1m1m_RG keyword_benchmark

touch tensorflow/lite/micro/kernels/xtensa/fully_connected.cc

#build for release
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile -j8 TARGET=xtensa OPTIMIZED_KERNEL_DIR=xtensa TARGET_ARCH=hifimini XTENSA_CORE=mini1m1m_RG keyword_benchmark BUILD_TYPE=release

xt-size tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/gen/xtensa_hifimini/bin/keyword_benchmark 
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  54736	  48168	  25032	 127936	  1f3c0	tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/gen/xtensa_hifimini/bin/keyword_benchmark
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What we really should be doing is to change the output directory based on the build type.
