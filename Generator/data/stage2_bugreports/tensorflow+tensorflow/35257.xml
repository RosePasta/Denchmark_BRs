	<summary>tensorflow 2.0 tf.linalg.normalize yields nan</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;tf.linalg.normalize(np.zeros([10, 4]), ord=1, axis=-1) yields nan as below&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

(&lt;tf.Tensor: id=58, shape=(10, 4), dtype=float64, numpy=
array([[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan],
[nan, nan, nan, nan]])&gt;,
&lt;tf.Tensor: id=57, shape=(10, 1), dtype=float64, numpy=
array([[0.],
[0.],
[0.],
[0.],
[0.],
[0.],
[0.],
[0.],
[0.],
[0.]])&gt;)

I know this is caused by divide by 0, so in the future tensorflow should make this operation more numerically stable.

		I have tried on colab with TF version 2.0 ,2.1.0-rc1 and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/050a8b84e6e584ca6567697b674e8230/untitled490.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		This seems to be working as intended. How would you normalize 0? The NaN tell you that you tried something that is not well defined, exactly as intended.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
