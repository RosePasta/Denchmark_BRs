		Ah I see the issue. You never used either of your Concatenate layers. Here is a smaller example to reproduce:
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(16)
    self.concat = tf.keras.layers.Concatenate(axis=1)

  def call(self, inputs):
    return self.dense(inputs)

model = MyModel()
model.build((16, 16))
model.summary()
The error is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: You tried to call `count_params` on concatenate, but the layer isn't built. You can build it manually via: `concatenate.build(batch_input_shape)`.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This isn't a bug, but perhaps we could improve the error message?

 Sorry for the delay due to the hotch-potch in China, I am also confused, is it not a bug related to model.summary() in tf2.1?
