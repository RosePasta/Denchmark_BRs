System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0.0-alpha.0
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/estimators

Describe the documentation issue
It's confusing since abundant guide stuff were uploaded, since no guide for custom estimator, just an example of using boostedClassifier
Is tf.keras.Model replacing tf.estimator?
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?

Thanks a lot, it seems like estimator is deprecated since that document shows lots of "compat.v1"

		Estimators are supported in 2.0 however the custom estimators will run in TF 1.X style in 2.0
