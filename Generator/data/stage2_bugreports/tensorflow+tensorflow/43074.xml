Error reported does not seem like a bug or feature request for tensorflow, which can be seen only after you share complete stand alone code for us to analyse.
As per the error reported:
You may refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59843548/python-valueerror-csv-row-has-different-number-of-fields-with-csv-and-tensorf&gt;this link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thank you very much for your fast response to my problem filed as bug. I do not believe, your stack flow referenced item is applicable in this case.  Please let me know, if you can replicate my problem, using the attached file.

In my example, I have shown, that one of the tensorflow API's can read the csv files as below:
types=[tf.int32,tf.int32,tf.int32,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64,tf.float64]
adataset = tf.data.experimental.CsvDataset(data, types, header=True)

therefore, there is no issue with files.

However, When I use the  following:
column_names=['subject#','age','sex','test_time','motor_UPDRS','total_UPDRS','Jitter(%)','Jitter(Abs)',
              'Jitter:RAP','Jitter:PPQ5','Jitter:DDP','Shimmer','Shimmer(dB)','Shimmer:APQ3','Shimmer:APQ5',
              'Shimmer:APQ11','Shimmer:DDA','NHR','HNR','RPDE','DFA','PPE']
labels=column_names.pop(4)
labels=[labels,column_names.pop(4)]


batch_size = 32

train_dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(
    data,
    batch_size,
    column_names=column_names,
    label_name=labels,
    num_epochs=1)

The API call generates the error as below:
&lt;denchmark-link:#&gt;…&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I believe, the problem is arising from the other API is due to labels containing two elements, instead of one (That is my guess). When this api is used to generate data set from UCI dataset, the API generates, the error.

Therefore, either this is a bug, when attempting to create a two label (output) dataset or a feature request to be able to have two labels as outputs.

As I have shared the notebook link, Please let me know, where is the error or what I am doing wrong ....

I am also attaching the datafile for your replication of the problem I am seeing.

Thank you very much for your attention towards this matter....

		To be concise, currently the api used does not support more than one label *multiple outputs) for the dataset as it takes only one string. If I am wrong, please let me know. Below is the API, description:



label_name
A optional string corresponding to the label column. If provided, the data for this column is returned as a separate Tensor from the features dictionary, so that the dataset complies with the format expected by a tf.Estimator.train or tf.Estimator.evaluate input function.

		<comment id='7' author='harica' date='2020-09-09T15:43:43Z'>
		By the way, label when provided as string, the API, does create the dataset.

 I don't think it is a bug you problem is that you have removed  elements with  so it is mismatching csv row elements.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;train_dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(
    data,
    batch_size,
    column_names=column_names,
    field_delim=',',

		<comment id='9' author='harica' date='2020-09-09T16:08:26Z'>
		Okay, I agree, it is not a bug as the API defined right now.
However, the API, lacks capability to have multiple labels(multiple outputs) for the network. Therefore, the API may need to be enhanced to provide a way to pass more than one label column ...
