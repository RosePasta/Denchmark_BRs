	<summary>[TF 2.0 API Docs] tf.math.atan and tf.math.asin</summary>
	<description>
System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0
Doc Links:
tf.math.atan: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math/atan
tf.math.asin: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math/asin

Describe the documentation issue
Documentation for tf.math.asin and tf.math.atan is created from a generated file, python/ops/gen_math_ops.py. The documentation can be modified by editing the appropriate .pbtxt files within the tensorflow/tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api directory of the source repository.
Both of these math operations could use a clear description, usage examples, and a list specifying the errors raised by these operations.
