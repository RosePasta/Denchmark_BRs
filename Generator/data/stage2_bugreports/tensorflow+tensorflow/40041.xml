	<summary>Customizing what happens in fit()</summary>
	<description>
I read the guide document of keras, and run codes of 'Customizing what happens in fit() -&gt; Going lower-level', just copy code on the guide and run it, but I get this error message:
"ValueError: The model cannot be compiled because it has no loss to optimize."
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): manjaro
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0 cpu
Python version: 3.7


I run code copied from here "&lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/guides/customizing_what_happens_in_fit/#going-lowerlevel&gt;https://keras.io/guides/customizing_what_happens_in_fit/#going-lowerlevel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
"
Describe the expected behavior
According to the doc, I can just skip passing loss function when I call model.compile, but it does not work, It seems like when I call model.fit, the overrided method "train_step" is not called.

'
Here is the stand alone code that replicates the issue. By the way both tf2.0.0 and tf2.1.0 have this issue, but it works well in tf2.2.0

		This &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/guides/customizing_what_happens_in_fit.py&gt;guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was published in TF 2.2 dev cycle.
Therefore it works with TF 2.2 onwards. TF 2.1 was released in early January which is much older than recently released TF 2.2

		Yes, I konw this, and I am using TF2.2 now, but it's still an issue for people who have not upgrade to TF 2.2, right?
Maybe you can let other guys konw this when they read that guide.
