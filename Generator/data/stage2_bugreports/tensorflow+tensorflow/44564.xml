System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:N/A
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
TF 2.3 tf.data.TFRecordDataset() failed to load files from S3.
Side note:
tf_file_io is working properly for the same setup.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt; from tensorflow.python.lib.io import file_io as tf_file_io
&gt;&gt; tf_file_io.file_exists('SOME_S3_FILE')

True
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

See error log below.
Describe the expected behavior
Same API and environments works well with TF 2.1 and TF 1.15.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset('SOME_S3_PATH')
for raw_record in dataset.take(10):
  print(repr(raw_record))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Saduf2019&gt;@Saduf2019&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 taking look into this.
To reproduce the error it requires:

S3 bucket access
AWS credential setup for the given S3 bucket

(Unfortunately, my current setup is not public accessible/sharable)
Once its setup then you can run the following tests:

Smoke test (should pass)

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.python.lib.io import file_io as tf_file_io
tf_file_io.file_exists('SOME_S3_TFRECORD_FILE')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


TFRecordDataset load (should fail)

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset('SOME_S3_TFRECORD_FILE')
for raw_record in dataset.take(10):
  print(repr(raw_record))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Quick updates on my end:
This issue seems related to the S3 multi part download that's introduced in TF2.2.
By disable the functionality with os.environ['S3_DISABLE_MULTI_PART_DOWNLOAD'] = '1',  tf.data.TFRecordDataset() can load data from S3 properly.

I am working on this error. But I am not able to reproduce it locally. Could you tried tf.io.read_file('SOME_S3_TFRECORD_FILE'). If it still falied for the same reason, could you please tell me the size of that file and check your environmental variables ( especially AWS_REGION because s3 usually fails because of bucket region ) ?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vnvo2409&gt;@vnvo2409&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yeah  failed with the same reason, see stacktrace
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-12-16 19:07:50.187041: W tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1767] OP_REQUIRES failed at whole_file_read_ops.cc:116 : Failed precondition: AWS Credentials have not been set properly. Unable to access the specified S3 location

tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.FailedPreconditionError: AWS Credentials have not been set properly. Unable to access the specified S3 location [Op:ReadFile]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In this use case, credentials are not passed in as environment variables but configured for Amazon EC2 instance that has an IAM role.
Side note: tf.io.read_file('SOME_S3_TFRECORD_FILE') works fine though by disabling multi part data loading with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os
os.environ['S3_DISABLE_MULTI_PART_DOWNLOAD'] = '1' 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Unfortunately, I don't have access to an EC2 instance right now. Could you please set the environement as follow in order to see what did happend behind the scene ?
import os
os.environ["TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL"] = "0"
os.environ["TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL"] = "5"
os.environ["AWS_LOG_LEVEL"] = "trace"

Many thanks for the stack trace. I am unable to understand what are happening. Please wait till the modular filesystem is ready. With that filesystem, error should be clearer. In addition, please check if there are any sensitive information inside the stack trace and remove it !
Maybe it could be related here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/43344&gt;#43344&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
