	<summary>undefined reference error while building Lite for ESP32 "person_detection" example</summary>
	<description>
@tensorflow/micro
System information

Host OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Win7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
Tensorflow version (commit SHA if source): Latest version
Target platform (e.g. Arm Mbed OS, Arduino Nano 33 etc.): ESP32

Describe the problem
I git the whole latest tensorflow branch on my WIN7 PC. I intended to use "Tensorflow Lite for Micro". I wanted to try the included examples "Person Detection" first to make sure everything works out of box. So I followed the readme instruction by running "make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=esp generate_person_detection_esp_project". According to the Makefile, five 3rd party downloads should be downloaded first. However, I got the MD5 mismatch error for each and every single one of them. So I had to 'hack' the Makefile to disable the MD5 checksum checking and manually downloaded those required 5 downloads and installed in the 'C:\Projects\tensorflow\tensorflow\lite\micro\tools\make\downloads' folder.
Then the make seemed to run for a few minutes, the stopped at the following error:

I also attached full log file for reference. Please show me how to fix this problem and get at least the example built and running. Thanks!

thanks for your prompt response. However, I read through the post you suggested but did not see anywhere could help with my own issue. I'm trying to make for ESP32 mcu on WIN7 machine. But the link you suggested was for Android build. Please help pointing to the right direction. Thanks!

		Edit:
To correct my original problem description: the make step was successful after I ''hacked" the MD5 checksum and manually downloaded those 5 3rd party downloads.
But this 'undefined reference to `RespondToDetection(tflite::ErrorReporter, unsigned char, unsigned char)'* error came when I tried to build the example prj using "idf.py build" cmd.
Just as a reference, I also tried building 'hello_world' example with same procedure, that went successfully. So I guess there might be something missing in the 'person_detection' example.
Hope that clear things up. Thanks!

		Can anyone please help with this problem? I'm stuck here for a couple of days and I've exhausted almost the whole build link but couldn't see any problem. This 'undefined reference' error seems to be missing a file which I couldn't figure out
Any suggestion or advise would be greatly appreciated!

		Update: I've figured out. This can be closed.
