		Oh, a typo, right? However, I'm afraid that we should submit the issue to tensor board: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I don't see any typo at "&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/embedding#projections&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/embedding#projections&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
", could you please redirect to the correct link unless it has already been fixed.

		If I understand you correctly, you point out the "Euclidian" is not correct name here in the screenshot. And we should correct it to "Euclidean", right?

 thanks for reply. I think it is a typo, however we should report the issue to tensor board repository.

 could you please fix this?

		The typo is fixed in TensorBoard. Fixing the minor typo in the screenshot would require monkey patching the PNG in Photoshop and uploading it directly to the documentation web server. Re-assigning to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dr4b&gt;@dr4b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We've done this change internally and it just has to propagate out in the next release, sorry.  Closing for now.
