	<summary>Stop inheriting `tf.keras.Model` to build custom layers in tutorials and guides.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;



https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/nmt_with_attention
Encoder, BahdanauAttention and Decoder inherit tf.keras.Model.


https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager#variables_and_optimizers
Model does not need to be a subclass of tf.keras.Model because we don't use Model's utility methods.


https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_layers#models_composing_layers

The main class used when creating a layer-like thing which contains other layers is tf.keras.Model. Implementing one is done by inheriting from tf.keras.Model.

This is not accurate since TF 1.13 (and standalone keras 2.3.0)


There are other tutorials which use tf.keras.Model when tf.keras.layers.Layer is sufficient.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We should stop inheriting tf.keras.Model in tutorials when we don't use utility functions of Model.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since tf1.13 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/releases/tag/2.3.0&gt;standalone keras 2.3.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, .
Also, &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models&gt;Writing custom layers and models with Keras&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says 
We don't need to inherit  unless we use "utility methods" of . I think the idea like  is not correct becauseÂ utilities of Model work only with special subsets of Layer (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c8ef33dd913463ced8cc347c03945a88b34da7f8/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L1461&gt;Layers whose call receive only one input&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
Thus, I think we should stop inheriting tf.keras.Model in tutorials when tf.keras.layers.Layer is enough.
My original question on stackoverflow as a context of this bug:
