	<summary>tf.with_dependencies isn't exposed, but it is used in documentations</summary>
	<description>
There are some examples that uses tf.with_dependencies (ex. &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/control_flow_ops.html#Assert&gt;tf.Assert in r0.11&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) but tf.with_dependencies isn't exposed to tensorflow module.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

branch: master branch $ git rev-parse HEAD =&gt; &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c7edafccc793bf87e29aaec90db64471a7a4bb02&gt;c7edafc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; tf.with_dependencies()"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'with_dependencies'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Looks like it is maybe being removed by this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/__init__.py#L241&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/__init__.py#L241&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Remove all extra symbols that don't have a docstring or are not explicitly
# referenced in the whitelist.

 Is this correct?

		We have lots of internal uses for that, so I'm assuming that all commits on master work, but there might be some cherry-picks in 0.11 that don't work. Let's see if I can repro first.

		It looks like it was not part of our public API, even though it was documented. Looping internally for a fix. You'll have to upgrade.

		Actually, there tf.control_dependencies that provides the core functionality, and you should just use that. I'll update the doc.

		Submitted change internally to remove the doc example. It'll be pushed to the main repo soon.
