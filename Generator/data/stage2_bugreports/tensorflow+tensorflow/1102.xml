	<summary>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Copy' on fully_connected.py. Built from source on 15th February.</summary>
	<description>
I built from source on 15th February. I can run cifar10_train.py, with the warning during training as stated here.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1076&gt;#1076&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I can run the convolutional mnist with no problems. However, when I try fully_connected.py, this error shows up.
Traceback (most recent call last):

I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling TensorFlow. I don't think it's a problem with the installation since some examples run properly. Anyone else facing this too?

		This looks like a bug, a missing function that we need to implement.   Thanks for reporting.

		Thanks for the fix. I have verified that Copy is back. But it's still missing Open.

		Yep, I have another fix for that coming.
