System information


TensorFlow version:
('v1.13.1-0-g6612da8951', '1.13.1') (see #27538)
('v1.12.0-9492-g2c319fb415', '2.0.0-alpha0') (see #27539) and
tf-nightly-2.0-preview (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55682557/)


Doc Link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining and
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/hub_with_keras



Both documents mention but do not describe conversion to mobile models. Yet, conversion using  failed in every attempt. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55849309/retrain-image-detection-with-mobilenet&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55849309/retrain-image-detection-with-mobilenet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which mentions two attempts by me as well as questions by others with the same problem.
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
As soon as it is working, I would gladly fix and/or augment the docs.  I have not gotten  to , despite the docs stating that it should work, &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/hub_with_keras#export_your_model&gt;e.g.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

This saved model can loaded for inference later, or converted to TFLite or TFjs.
