	<summary>Object Detection API Android demo performance issue</summary>
	<description>
System information

Windows 10:
Android app testing on LG Nexus 5:
TensorFlow installed from source:

Describe the problem
I have built Object Detection API Android demo and testing on LG Nexus 5. But it has following performance issue:
After some object is detected e.g. "person", it is keeping to show bounding box and score for last detected object even if the camera is capturing scene with no objects e.g. black screen.  Screenshots are given below.
Any other info / logs
Project has been built using following configuration:
def nativeBuildSystem = 'none'
Trained Model: SSD MobileNet

 Thanks for reply. The code is the original Tensorflow Object Detection API Android demo code: &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 You need to compile the "libtensorflow_demo.so" for your phone architecture, it is used for the tracking. First try to add this to your project: &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/miyosuda/TensorFlowAndroidDemo/tree/master/app/src/main/jniLibs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The issue is resolved by adding object tracking to the project, which is building the project using bazel.
