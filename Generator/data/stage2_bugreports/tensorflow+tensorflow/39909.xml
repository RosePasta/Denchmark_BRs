	<summary>Max and min for dynamic tensors should be recorded during calibration: Failed for tensor Shape</summary>

System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed using pip, it's actually tf-nightly-gpu
TensorFlow version: tf-nightly-gpu==2.3.0.dev20200527

Command used to run the converter or code if youâ€™re using the Python API
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy
import tensorflow as tf

    return numpy.ones((size, 32, 86, 1), numpy.uint8) * 255

**Failure details**
I am trying to convert this model by performing full integer quantization described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization#full_integer_quantization_of_weights_and_activations), but it fails as described above. If I attempt to convert it without a representative dataset it works ok, but the input/output tensors remain float32 and I need int8. Maybe I am missing something, but I'd like to know if this is solvable. Thanks in advance.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have tried with tensorflow 2.2.0, but unfortunately I get the same error :/

		I think it's due to some latest commit. Since I also encounter this error with the nightly version, but the same code works with stable version.

		It doesn't work for me. Did you try my code by any chance and got it to work?

Can you please try it on version as suggested by xchani and share a colab gist in case you face any issues.

 I have tried what &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xchani&gt;@xchani&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested and sadly the same issue occurs. I have installed the stable version  as mentioned previously. Please find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yIx_J3NfIlDpaJw9XMgXpIT4XY69Y6nJ?usp=sharing&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jvishnuvardhan&gt;@jvishnuvardhan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for your answer. I have attempted the conversion as suggested on that answer but unfortunately I am still getting the same error. I updated the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yIx_J3NfIlDpaJw9XMgXpIT4XY69Y6nJ?usp=sharing#scrollTo=lgWmPjJjy9e-&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so you can see it as well.

		It seems that there was a tf.tile operation in my graph that cannot be quantized and probably was caught by this min/max exception. The correct exception seems to have been fixed in tf-nightly-gpu==2.3.0.dev20200615. Thanks for your support though!
