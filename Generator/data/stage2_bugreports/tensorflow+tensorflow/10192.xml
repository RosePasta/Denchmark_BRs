	<summary>How to know what commands and types are supported in iOS build?</summary>
	<description>
According to this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/9934#issuecomment-302817142&gt;comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  and other related issues currently there is some commands and types that iOS users can't load from  graph. So we could use any TF API in python but not in iOS. It is hard to guess what python API will not been supported in iOS. So is there any documentation or instructions of how to write solution using python API and what functions and types could be used to make  graph be fully supported by iOS API?

		Try this:
in the (your tensorflow root)/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile
remove the line "-D__ANDROID_TYPES_SLIM__ " under "# Settings for iOS." for all "$(IOS_ARCH)"
then recompile the libtensorflow-core.a according to the modified Makefile.
The reason why this happened is because:
in tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h
#if defined(ANDROID_TYPES_SLIM)
// Note that ANDROID_TYPES_SLIM is also checked in the cwise_ops*.cc files.
// Normally Android TensorFlow is built with a reduced number of types (float).
// Override on the command-line "--define ANDROID_TYPES=ANDROID_TYPES_FULL"
// to generate a library with full type support with a consequent increase in
// code size.
#define REGISTER2(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1) REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#define REGISTER3(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1, T2) REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#define REGISTER4(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1, T2, T3) REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#define REGISTER5(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4) REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#define REGISTER6(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5) REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#define REGISTER7(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6)
REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#define REGISTER8(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7)
REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#define REGISTER9(OP, D, N, F, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8)
REGISTER(OP, D, N, F, T0)
#else // !defined(ANDROID_TYPES_SLIM)
(ps: I also wrote a iOS_SSDMobilenet example base on the python ssd_mobilenet and ios_camera_example, and here is the github link: @&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JieHe96/ios_SSDMobilenet_tensorflow_example&gt;https://github.com/JieHe96/ios_SSDMobilenet_tensorflow_example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
