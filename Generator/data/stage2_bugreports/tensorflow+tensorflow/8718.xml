	<summary>Incorrect reference for tf.learn in Linear Model tutorials</summary>
	<description>
This &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/linear&gt;page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentions  multiple times.
However, looking at the links and source code, I believe that  should actually be either  or , not .
(I guess tf.learn was the old name, but got renamed but the tutorial is still outdated?)

		Could you fix or delegate this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wolffg&gt;@wolffg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
