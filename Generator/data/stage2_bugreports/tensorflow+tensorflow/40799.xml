	<summary>ValueError: Shapes (1, 107, 3) and (1, 107, 2) are incompatible</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): colab system(Linux version 4.19.104+ )
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):colab system installed it
TensorFlow version (use command below): tf2.2.0
Python version: 3.6

Describe the current behavior
I am doing some work about tensor train decomposition.

Firstly, I represent a video with tensor. The tensor  dimension is 4 which shape can be see with [ frames, width, heights,channels]. And the tensor shape is [107, 60, 80, 3].
Secondly, I convert the tf tensor to TT tensor via t3f library.
Thirdly, I write a Riemann dimension reduction function for the TT tensor.
In the end, I reduce  the TT tensor dimension via my function. But the bug come out in the end step.

What I want to say is that the bug didn't come out when I represent another data with tensor which shape is [107, 60, 80, 2] .In that situtation code runned very good.
The exit:


ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
ipython-input-34-e5f2500494ee in module()
1 log = []
2 for i in range(1000):
----&gt; 3     F = step()
4     if i % 10 == 0:
5         print(F)
4 frames
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_shape.py in assert_is_compatible_with(self, other)
1115     """
1116     if not self.is_compatible_with(other):
-&gt; 1117       raise ValueError("Shapes %s and %s are incompatible" % (self, other))
1118
1119   def most_specific_compatible_shape(self, other):
ValueError: Shapes (1, 107, 3) and (1, 107, 2) are incompatible

Describe the expected behavior
I expect the video convert to TT tensor can also be reduced dimension by my function been mentioned above without any error just as the shape [107, 60, 80, 2] data.

		Can you provide a minimal code to reproduce the issue? The error message makes sense, the last dimension in the shape does not match.

 I have put a minimal code in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bZiaDNQqpJjMFSQOhpXEgfMy-fwrhC8d?usp=sharing&gt;cell&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. But I can't provide the input data directly on the cell. If you need reproduce the issue, can download the data from my Google Drive link which is &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DVB7ReloEKTkqRBFyj8Uop6_FKf-oBYe/view?usp=sharing&gt;video data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DNS5xCMikgsvye1NZRmdDl3ebcG10ves/view?usp=sharing&gt;another data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I know the error message makes sense, but I don't think my two tensor have a different shape. And the another data I have shared can identify the code is well.

 I have find the reason the bug have been caused. I ignored a detail that a rank value need be modify in myself function. What a primary mistake. Thanks for all your patience! And I will close the issue.
