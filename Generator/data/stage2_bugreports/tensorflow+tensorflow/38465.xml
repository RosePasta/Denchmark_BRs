	<summary>ValueError specifying TensorSpec names while using model.save</summary>
	<description>
System information

Custom code has been written to define the model, and is given
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 19.10:
TensorFlow installed via pip
TensorFlow versions 2.1.0 &amp; 2.2.0.dev20200411 trialed
Python version: 3.7

Describe the current behavior
Attempting to use model.save() to save a trained model, raises the eventual error
ValueError: If specifying TensorSpec names for nested structures, either zero or all names have to be specified.
Code also raises the error while failing to save
WARNING:tensorflow:AutoGraph could not transform &lt;function canonicalize_signatures.&lt;locals&gt;.signature_wrapper at 0x7efb5076e0e0&gt; and will run it as-is. Please report this to the TensorFlow team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10) and attach the full output. Cause: Bad argument number for Name: 4, expecting 3
Another error that visible in the output is the failed conversion to JSON of a tf_graphics layer. This has been raised in the tensorflow_graphics repository
Describe the expected behaviour
Unsure - error was asked to be raised to TensorFlow team by the error text.

Current Code output
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING:tensorflow:AutoGraph could not transform &lt;bound method FeatureSteeredConvolutionKerasLayer.call of &lt;tensorflow_graphics.nn.layer.graph_convolution.FeatureSteeredConvolutionKerasLayer object at 0x7efb9617c790&gt;&gt; and will run it as-is.

Looks like code is incomplete. I am seeing the error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow_graphics'. Please, help us with colab link or simple standalone code to reproduce the issue in our environment. It helps us in localizing the issue faster. Thanks!

That's the tensorflow graphics api from:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/graphics&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/graphics&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - a newer API for tensorflow.
Please note I build that by pulling from source (git link above) as there is currently a bug in the released pypi repository ver.
As I mentioned above, the model does save without the tensorflow graphics API components(I've raised an issue on that repository as well) but it still raises the same Warnings:AutoGraph could not transform so I have left this issue open with the reason it specifically requests the issue be reported.

 This is similar to the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/graphics/issues/227&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  As mentioned in the issue, Removing the graph convolution layers allows the model to save.
Please take a look at it.

		I have run into the same error on a model built using the keras functional API. In particular, the error occurs when saving a checkpoint by calling tfk.models.save_model. My model takes two inputs (using the tf.data API), one of which is a tf.RaggedTensor and the other of which is a tf.Tensor.
A tf.RaggedTensorSpec doesn't have a name attribute and at some point the tf.RaggedTensorSpec is converted by TF into several tf.TensorSpecs, which therefore also don't have values for their name attributes.
The error does not occur when saving a weights-only checkpoint with tfk.Model.save_weights.

As I mentioned on the issue above, a helpful improvement here (potentially an easier stepping stone, before fixing the whole issue) would be to add more info to the error message, such as which layer(s) are causing the problem, to make it easier to narrow down the problem layers in a real-world model.

		I tested this on our real code in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/1689&gt;stellargraph/stellargraph#1689&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and the tests in question passed, so I can confirm that this seems to be fixed for our particular example. Thanks!
