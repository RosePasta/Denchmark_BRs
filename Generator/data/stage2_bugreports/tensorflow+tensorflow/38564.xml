	<summary>Wrong function in example for tensor_diag</summary>
	<description>
The examples in the documentations of tf.linalg.tensor_diag_part and tf.linalg.tensor_diag
are showing the non-tensor version of these functions, e.g.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# 'diagonal' is [1, 2, 3, 4]
tf.diag(diagonal) ==&gt; [[1, 0, 0, 0]
                       [0, 2, 0, 0]
                       [0, 0, 3, 0]
                       [0, 0, 0, 4]]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Is this issue not closed yet?

		I think the documentation seems to be fine and is indicating what the resulting Tensor would look like. Closing issue for now.

		sorry, but I have to disagree on this being resolved and the documentation being fine. The documentation shows an example which uses the tf.diag_part function, but is supposed to document usage of the tf.tensor_diag_part function (which is not an alias but another function). The choice of example seems also unfortunate in the sense that, in this particular case, both functions would give the same result, and as such the example does not help the reader to better understand the difference between the two.
