	<summary>Keras' load_weights() bug: ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 1 layers into a model with 0 layers.</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Colab
TensorFlow version: 2.0.0

Describe the current behavior
Using model.save_weights() and then model.load_weights() caused this error:
ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 1 layers into a model with 0 layers.

See &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-8kVsk-2PMTX_V_6VRHMWczz4T_4MPev&gt;this Colab notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		In 2.0, the default saving format is the TensorFlow checkpoint format. Can you try using the TF checkpoint format and see if the colab works? (Just remove the .h5 extension in the save filename, and it will save out to TF checkpoint format.)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/karmel&gt;@karmel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Saving to TF format should work. However, one cannot later load the weights with , which I need for doing transfer learning. I tried this on TF 2.1.0.dev20191103 but obtained  (the pretrained weights were trained from a different dataset having a different number of classes).

 As mentioned by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/karmel&gt;@karmel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I changed your code to save weights in *.tf format and everything works as expected. &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/1404f0bfd5a429b585f1de847600ae5a/tf_checkpoint.ipynb&gt;Here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the gist for your reference.
I am closing this issue as it was resolved. Please feel free to open if the issue persists with any other models. Thanks!

 You are basically saying that the  format is not officially supported? In that case please remove it from your documentation then.

 Sorry. I didn't mean that we are not officially supporting  format. Thanks!
If you want us to look in detail at your issue, please provide a simple standalone code to reproduce the error. Thanks!

 I think with subclass model, the input/output shape is unknown until it is first tested with proper data. I updated your code as follows which worked without any issue with .h5 format.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;net2 = Net(classes=5)
temp_predictions = net2(sample[0])
net2.load_weights('./net.h5')
new_predictions = net2(sample)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/fbc2cdea31a5b588a6525b2d62f009c0/tf_checkpoint.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Please close the issue if it is resolved. Thanks!
