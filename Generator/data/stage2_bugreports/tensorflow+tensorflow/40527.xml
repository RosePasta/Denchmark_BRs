	<summary>Can't load tf 2.1 model trained on ai platform</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 18.04 and MacOSX 10.15.5
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version: 2.1.0 and 2.2.0
Python version: 3.7 and 3.6


Can't load a model locally with tensorflow version 2.1. The model was trained on ai platform with &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/runtime-version-list#2.1&gt;runtime version 2.1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and saved using . It is possible to load the model locally with tensorflow version 2.2.
It is also possible to build the model locally and use .
&gt;&gt;&gt; import tensorflow as tf
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(tf.__version__)
2.2.0

Describe the expected behavior
Loading a model trained on ai platform with runtime version 2.1 should be possible to load locally with tensorflow version 2.1 and its corresponding tf.keras version. tf version 2.2 shouldn't be required to load the model.
 Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
Here is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CZwwfUV0uI3bGqi2b5NAUw5RlUoA_ZLV?usp=sharing&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to the model trained on ai platform (runtime version 2.1). For me it is possible to load it locally with tensorflow 2.2 but not with 2.1.

 thanks looking into this. I've created a &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nG5ziQ-bDF35CCrguzFFkRKvXr257z2k?usp=sharing&gt;Colab notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where you can see that loading the model works with tf 2.2 but not with 2.1 ().
Please remember that the model was trained on and downloaded from google cloud ai platform which currently supports only &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/runtime-version-list#2.1&gt;tensorflow 2.1 runtime version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		I have a guess why loading the model is only possible with tf 2.2 and not 2.1: From the job log on AI Platform it seems that another package (provided with --packages option), which depends on tensorflow==2.2.0 (not tensorflow-gpu), triggered the installation. According to the logs the package was first installed with pip3 --no-deps but then again without --no-deps which installed tf 2.2.
I wasn't aware that &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/versioning#custom-tf-versions&gt;newer versions of tensorflow, other than the runtime versions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, could be installed and that this can be done with a package dependency.
However, also the GPU was used while training. Shouldn't this only be possible when tensorflow-gpu is installed? And is it possible to inspect a SavedModel to see which version of tensorflow was used while saving it?

		Thanks for sharing your investigation. Version dependency is causing the issue.
tensorflow==2.2.0 installs both cpu and gpu packages.
Starting TF2 cpu and gpu packages are combined.
tensorflow-gpu==2.2.0 will install only gpu package.
Also there is no way to identify tensorflow version from the SavedModel.
