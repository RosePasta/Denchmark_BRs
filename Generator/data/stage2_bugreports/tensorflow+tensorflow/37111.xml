	<summary>representative_data_gen input order?</summary>
	<description>
In tflite post integer quantization, converter.representative_dataset is necessary.
However, the documentation never specifies the order of the fed inputs. Are they ordered by lexicographic order of the names, size of shapes or even random order? When multiple inputs are present, it is totally a guessing game.

 Are you interested in raising a PR to update the docs? Thanks!

		No, since I don't know either.

 , I have added line in doc corresponding to the necessity of . You have also mentioned something about order of inputs. I don't understand that. Can you please elaborate so that I will also make changes corresponding to that in the doc if needed.

For instance, suppose that I generate a  model with the following code:
# inputs: List[Tensor]
# outputs: List[Tensor]

inputs_dic = {
    "input_{}".format(idx): i
    for idx, i in zip(range(len(inputs)), inputs)
}
outputs_dic = {
    "output_{}".format(idx): o
    for idx, o in zip(range(len(outputs)), outputs)
}
builder = tf.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder(path)
sigs = {}
sigs[signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY] = \
    tf.saved_model.signature_def_utils.predict_signature_def(
    inputs_dic, outputs_dic
)
builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(
    sess,
    [tag_constants.SERVING],
    signature_def_map=sigs
)
builder.save()
Then I try to load the saved_model with tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model and configure the quantization options of this converter, including representative_dataset. However, I found that the fed inputs in representative_data_gen are not always in the order of input_0, input_1, etc. Plus, it is also not specified in the doc in detail.
It is not something that a end-user like me can pull a request. I checked the code. It seems that tflite feed inputs in the order of the presents of inputs in the serialized protobuf. It's kind of a "default" order. But nobody knows what the "default" order is.

 , Can you please provide the link of the file in tensorflow where you have checked this code. I also want to take a look at it.
