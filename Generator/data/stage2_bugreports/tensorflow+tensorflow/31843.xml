	<summary>Attempt to build with NDK only in configure.py results in invalid android.bzl</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04 (docker)
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: -
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version: 1.14.0
Python version: 3.7
Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?: pip yes
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.24.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): Clang from NDK r17b
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -

Describe the problem
I'm attempting to build tensorflow light using android NDK compiler, without plugging in SDK.
Therefore I set TF_SET_ANDROID_WORKSPACE to 0, while I have ANDROID_NDK_HOME pointing to location of valid NDK installation.
Attempting to perform such build results in error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: /root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/9deba62a2f90185d207a955a930b77dc/external/local_config_android/android.bzl:10:2: indentation error
ERROR: error loading package '': Extension 'android.bzl' has errors
ERROR: error loading package '': Extension 'android.bzl' has errors
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This happens because configure.py adds ndk location (specified in env variable) by appending to android.bzl that has only pass in body of function.
But it is added with 2 spaces, while rest of android.bzl was with 4 tabs.
This is the first problem, I have to manually remove pass and leave only NDK setup
Probably there should not be such difference in tabulation when generating android.bzl
The second issue, is whether it should be possible to build //tensorflow/lite:libtensorflowlite.so with NDK only.
I was able to do so after manually correcting android.bzl
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem

Environment variables:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;PYTHON_BIN_PATH = &lt;valid location python&gt;
USE_DEFAULT_PYTHON_LIB_PATH = '1'
TF_ENABLE_XLA = '0'
TF_NEED_ROCM = '0'
TF_NEED_CUDA = '0'
TF_NEED_MPI = '0'
TF_DOWNLOAD_CLANG = '0'
TF_SET_ANDROID_WORKSPACE = '0'
TF_CONFIGURE_IOS = '0'
ANDROID_NDK_HOME = &lt;valid location of NDK&gt;
ANDROID_NDK_API_LEVEL = '18'
TF_NEED_OPENCL_SYCL = '1'
TF_NEED_COMPUTECPP = '0'
TRISYCL_INCLUDE_DIR = '&lt;path to cloned repo of TrySYCL&gt;/include'
HOST_CXX_COMPILER = '&lt;NDK path&gt;/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/clang++'
HOST_C_COMPILER = '&lt;NDK path&gt;/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/clang'
CC_OPT_FLAGS = '-Wno-sign-compare'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Run python configure.py
Rim bazel shutdown
Run build with bazel build --config=opt --config=v2 --cxxopt='--std=c++11' --define=no_tensorflow_py_deps=true --config=android_arm64 //tensorflow/lite:libtensorflowlite.so --verbose_failures

Any other info / logs
Manual correction of android.bzl results in successful build, but it seems there are no symbols related to GPU delegate (I guess a separate target is required?)

		Feel free to propose a fix that allows setting the SDK as optional.

		There is something unclear to me currently.
Is it bazel, who requires SDK in addition to NDK in order to build android related projects, or tensorflow?

		I suspect you'll need to modify something in this file: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/third_party/android/android_configure.bzl&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/third_party/android/android_configure.bzl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ok, thx, I'll test various approaches and will be back with PR
