&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Create a function to compute negative (-1), neutral (0) and positive (+1) analysis&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

def getAnalysis(score):
if score &lt; 0:
return 'Negative'
elif score == 0:
return 'Neutral'
else:
return 'Positive'
df['Analysis'] = df['Polarity'].apply(getAnalysis)
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Show the dataframe&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
