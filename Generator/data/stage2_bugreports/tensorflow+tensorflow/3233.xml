	<summary>partial_run can't do incremental feeds in InteractiveSession</summary>
	<description>
Here is a section of code copied from the docstring of partial_run, with required import statements added. However, note that this constructs an InteractiveSession instead of a Session.
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.python.ops import array_ops, math_ops
from tensorflow.python import dtypes
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

a = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
b = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
c = array_ops.placeholder(dtypes.float32, shape=[])
r1 = math_ops.add(a, b)
r2 = math_ops.mul(r1, c)

h = sess.partial_run_setup([r1, r2], [a, b, c])
res = sess.partial_run(h, r1, feed_dict={a: 1, b: 2})
res = sess.partial_run(h, r2, feed_dict={c: res})
The code fails with a NotFoundError. When the InteractiveSession is replaced by a normal Session, the code runs correctly. The difference between the two is that the interactive session sets the place_pruned_graph option to True (starting a plain Session with place_pruned_graph=True reproduces the issue.)
I do all of my work in an interactive terminal, and I would find it useful to have partial_run work correctly in this setting.

		I am able to reproduce this. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yuanbyu&gt;@yuanbyu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you take a look, as you have looked at other partial_run issues?

		Thank you for reporting this. Since the code has changed substantially since the issue was open, it's not clear whether it's still valid. Please open a new issue if the problem persists with new versions of tensorflow.

 Please don't close this.
Nothing has "changed substantially" that I am aware of -- it took me less than a minute to re-run the above sample code in tensorflow 0.12 (I just had to fix some trivial renames). The same error persists.
Code to reproduce is:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[])
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[])
c = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[])
r1 = tf.add(a, b)
r2 = tf.mul(r1, c)

h = sess.partial_run_setup([r1, r2], [a, b, c])
res = sess.partial_run(h, r1, feed_dict={a: 1, b: 2})
res = sess.partial_run(h, r2, feed_dict={c: res})

 this looks like a bug in .

		Here's the stack trace:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    res = sess.partial_run(h, r1, feed_dict={a: 1, b: 2})
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 821, in partial_run
    return self._run(handle, fetches, feed_dict, None, None)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 964, in _run
    feed_dict_string, options, run_metadata)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 1017, in _do_run
    fetch_list)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/client/session.py", line 1034, in _do_call
    raise type(e)(node_def, op, message)
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: Feed Placeholder_2:0: not found
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

_do_run calls _do_call with this (both working and non-working paths print the same):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;function _prun_fn at 0x7f7c98f80488&gt;

		OK, I need to call it a day for now but we're failing to find it in  here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc#L822&gt;https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc#L822&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and when using  we're not inserting it in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/direct_session.cc#L932&gt;values&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (only  and  get inserted, not any of the placeholders).

 looks like this is still a problem in the latest version.
Any updates on the problem?

 did you try a regular Session instead of an InteractiveSession?
