	<summary>Python3 type annotation does not work with @tf.function + for loop -&amp;gt; tf.while_loop conversion</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: n/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0 alpha
Python version: 3.6.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a

Describe the current behavior
If you use python3 type annotation such as x:tf.Tensor = tf.constant(0) (I aliased tf.Tensor for various shape to keep my sanity for reinforcement learning problems) in a @tf.function and the function contains a for loop to be translated to tf.while_loop (that doesn't even have to use the tensor that's annotated), the code will fail as if you did not turn on eager execution.
Describe the expected behavior
Python3 type hinting should not fail the code.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;@tf.function
def tf_for_tf_break():
    x: tf.Tensor = tf.constant(0)
    for i in tf.range(5):
        x += i
    return x

print(tf_for_tf_break())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I am able to reproduce the issue on colab with TF 2.0alpha . This is the error I got TypeError: Tensor objects are only iterable when eager execution is enabled. To iterate over this tensor use tf.map_fn.
