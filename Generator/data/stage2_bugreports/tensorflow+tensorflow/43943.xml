	<summary>Cannot load data from imdb_reviews datasets.</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu20.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): conda
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.8.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1, 7.6.5
GPU model and memory: RTX2060, VRAM6GB

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
When I run
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

imdb, info = tfds.load('imdb_reviews', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)
the only output is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Downloading and preparing dataset imdb_reviews (80.23 MiB) to /root/tensorflow_datasets/imdb_reviews/plain_text/0.1.0...
HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=1.0, bar_style='info', description='Dl Completed...', max=1.0, style=Progre…
HBox(children=(FloatProgress(value=1.0, bar_style='info', description='Dl Size...', max=1.0, style=ProgressSty…
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and loading takes forever to end(won't end).
Note: There are no errors or warnings shown, I just see these three lines, and the process never goes on.
The process succeeded once for some reason after many times of trials, and the output came with a warning. I forgot the contents but it ended with '...migrate to tensorflow_text'.
Of course this is the only time when I successfully got the loaded data so that's why I am here.
I tried to import data from keras.datasets and there seems no problems with it(was able to get the data imported with no warning and error).
I just want to know what this import problem is. Also I am wondering why there are no people facing the same problems.
Describe the expected behavior
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

Thank you two for running the code and sorry for not replying for some time.
I understand you ran the code without any problems, and I think the only difference in the environment is that I'm using docker.
But it doesn't make any sense if tensorflow goes crazy on docker.
Where do you think there is a problem?
