	<summary>Clarify that tf.image.adjust_brightness accepts negative values</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/adjust_brightness&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/adjust_brightness&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The documentation states that delta should be in the range [0, 1). However, the delta is added to the image so negative values in the range (-1, 0] are also valid, and useful if the image should be made darker.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It is useful to be able to darken images, and the documentation should make it clear how to do so.

		I wondered this myself. Since random_adjust_brightness provides a value in the interval [-max_delta, max_delta) it seems that negative values should be accepted.
I wondered whether this could be an issue with underflow for unsigned integer representations? The calculation is done as a float, but scaling and casting negative results (e.g. -0.1) to uint could give some weird behaviour. You can't just set a hard limit of 0 either, because some projects scale pixel values between -1 and 1.

)
Edit: never mind, I've just seen that the return command for adjust_brightness takes care of overflow/underflow with the saturate argument:
return convert_image_dtype(adjusted, orig_dtype, saturate=True)

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
