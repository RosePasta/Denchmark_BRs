&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/5341&gt;#5341&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
git clone &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

./configure
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.0.0rc1-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
1.0.0-rc1
If installed from source, provide

The commit hash (git rev-parse HEAD)
bd4a1c5
The output of bazel version
Build label: 0.4.4

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I use a tensorboard example that I think is quite easy to reproduce the issue.
git clone https://github.com/normanheckscher/mnist-tensorboard-embeddings
cd mnist-tensorboard-embeddings/

# modify the path at line 97 and 99 in mnist_t-sne.py
python mnist_t-sne.py
# start tensorboard
tensorboard --logdir=/home/chih-yao/Documents/mnist-tensorboard-embeddings/logs/
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What other attempted solutions have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 Make sure my tensorboard --logdir=/home/chih-yao/Documents/mnist-tensorboard-embeddings/logs/ path is correct
 Reinstall tensorflow from source
 Make sure the metadata and event files exist in the logdir

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs or other output that would be helpful&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorboard --logdir=/home/chih-yao/Documents/mnist-tensorboard-embeddings-master/logs

		Same here (at commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/088b2d49e9dd0ce752b0019c7e543c249e0a8052&gt;088b2d4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Tensorboard has been broken for several days now. You can revert the past few days of commits to "solve" this issue:
git reset --hard 8dc43a3
I suspect this is what broke it:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5d56ddbe3d84ff2ccf15c87de95e70840d56b7e7&gt;5d56ddb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Maybe tb still works in Chrome? That could explain why core developers aren't seeing this. I'm in Firefox.

		On it.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jart&gt;@jart&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it looks like this was broken by the webfiles build changes.

		Also, contrary to the initial issue description, I think this is broken on master but not in the release candidate. (phew)

		Currently investigating.
Unrelated: I'm noticing there's a lot of stuff in this pip package that has no business being there. We need to fix that.

Unrelated: Shouldn't purelib/external/ directory should probably be named purelib/tensorflow/_external/ or something, so it's less likely to collide with other stuff.

		I'm pretty confident &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/7431&gt;#7431&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is going to fix this. Would anyone from the community mind patching that tiny change and seeing it TensorBoard works again?

		For slimming down the pip package:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/caisq&gt;@caisq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 working to remove some of the external libraries from pip package.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keveman&gt;@keveman&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just removed protobuf from our pip package.

 Pulled your3e1973688  patch and tested it.
Tensorboard works again. Seems snappier too when reloading boards.

		Same issue, tensorboard 2.1.0, Win 7, Python 3.7, training with torch 1.1
Downgrading to tensorboard 2.0.0 fixes the issue for now

		Hi, I have the same problem in Win 10 [Version 10.0.18363.836]. I do get a file in my browser but it just shows an empty page. Looking into the HTML file (see attached) it seems to be damaged. Line 24 - 224 ist somehow missing.  Is this a bug in the tensorboard?
