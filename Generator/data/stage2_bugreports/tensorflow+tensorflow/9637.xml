	<summary>Convolutional Neural Networks Tutorial problem</summary>
	<description>
I am learning about Convolutional Neural Networks from the tutorial:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Inside it there is a link for getting the code but it is not working:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow_models/tutorials/image/cifar10/&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow_models/tutorials/image/cifar10/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

how can I get the code?

		Most tensorflow models are now in their own &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models&gt;models repo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Here's what you're looking for: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I think you're referring to the link here, right?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The CIFAR-10 network is largely contained in cifar10.py. 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Feel free to send a PR correcting the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/tutorials/deep_cnn.md#L99&gt;md file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		It looks like the .md file on GitHub is correct, but the TensorFlow site documentation points to the wrong place. Seems like a documentation bug -- talked to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wolffg&gt;@wolffg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and he will look into it.

		Another bug in the same document is the last sentence in the "Pooling Layer &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1&gt;#1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
" section.  It says "has a shape of [batch_size, 14, 14, 1]" but it should read "has a shape of [batch_size, 14, 14, ]"

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ddurham2&gt;@ddurham2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for reporting this. We fixed this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8301&gt;#8301&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but unfortunately it looks like it still hasn't been pushed to the documentation site. Once r1.2 becomes the standard version however, the site will be correct (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/tutorials/layers#pooling_layer_1&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/tutorials/layers#pooling_layer_1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		Closing this issue since it has been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/tutorials/deep_cnn&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/tutorials/deep_cnn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and will be the default once r1.2 is the standard.
