 we have is based out of 16.04, its better if we can move to 18.04.
The corresponding version of TF Serving is already using 18.04 based ubuntu in their Dockerfile.

		I have already moved all of my testing to 18.04 based docker files.  I have not issues moving the defaults to 18.04.  We can virtually copy my performance docker files.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/perfzero/docker&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/perfzero/docker&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I would approve that without hesitation.
