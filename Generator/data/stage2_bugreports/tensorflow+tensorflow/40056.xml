	<summary>org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu nightly build error vs 2.2.0</summary>
	<description>
Im not even sure how reportable this bug is, since it is occurring on a nightly build (6/1/2020), Code was working on friday.
However when I change from nightly build to 2.2.0, works just fine:
fliteOptions.addDelegate(GpuDelegate())  
but on nightly:
E/TestRunner: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol "_ZN6tflite3gpu2cl9Arguments11kArgsPrefixE" referenced by "/data/app/~~KImLgowMRYSuuZbqgdRMgw==/com.qualcomm.style-LOBlofHPnlpjAMuiEJPKFQ==/lib/arm64/libtensorflowlite_gpu_jni.so"...
at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:1087)
trips it when it is loading the library
The models used are the same models found in the style transfer android sample project, and I will link them in this post.
Also, if there is a special procedure or contact for nightly build bugs, let me know.
The models are quantized, which means it should fallback to the cpu, I think this is just a general linking build issue, rather than a gpu delegate problem. I will include the models for reproduce ability

		I have encountered the same problem with tflite gpu nightly
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol "_ZN6tflite3gpu2cl9Arguments11kArgsPrefixE" referenced by "/data/app/com.at.nikhil.speciesai-yi_FcI_5AKGpV5FjG1HVTg==/lib/arm64/libtensorflowlite_gpu_jni.so"...
Code was working totally fine just few days back. However, when built with tflite 2.2.0, it worked like charm.
The model is a standard keras CNN model.

		This is fixed now. You need to clear grade cache to download recent nightly aar file.

		Invalidated cache ("File" -&gt; "Invalidate Caches/Restart") still seeing this issue when using GPU delegate.
EDIT:
Actually used rm -rf $HOME/.gradle/caches/ and now it works fine.
