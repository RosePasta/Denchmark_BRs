And after I remove  transform option  remove_nodes(op=Identity, op=CheckNumerics),
It seems succeed, but when I open optimized pb fie, bn node is still there, which not be fold.
I test other classification model,  transform_graph just woks well. But in my model, it just can not work. By the way, my model has multiple input and shares backbone mobilenet_v2.

		Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Please fill the issue template. Could you update them if they are relevant in your case, or leave them as N/A? . If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;the Github new issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

 Could you share minimum standalone code to reproduce the issue? Did you check graph transform with other tensorflow models? Thanks!

I have checked graph transform with other tensorflow models, including mobilenet_v1, mobilenet_v2 in slim, but with multiple input and a shared mobilenet_v2, it fails

 Could you add 'fold_constants(ignore_errors=ture)' to the transforms list as fold_constants is prerequisite of fold_batch_norms?
