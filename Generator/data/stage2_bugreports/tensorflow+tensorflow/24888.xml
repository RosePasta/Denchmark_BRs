	<summary>Tflite Op missing:Stack</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from ( pip ):
TensorFlow version ( 1.10 ):

Provide the text output from tflite_convert
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.contrib.lite.toco_convert(). Here is a list of operators for which  you will need custom implementations: Stack.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		As far as I know, the Op 'Stack' is closely related to Op 'Strided_slice', and both of them seems easy to be implemented.
So I wonder why these Ops weren not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime.

 Could you provide an example code to reproduce the error? That will help us to find the root-cause of the issue? Thanks!

 Thanks for your help, and my code shows below:

resize_image(image, size,method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR,align_corners=False):
"""Resize an image and bounding boxes. """
# Resize image.
with tf.name_scope('resize_image'):
height, width, channels = _ImageDimensions(image)
image = tf.expand_dims(image, 0)
image = tf.image.resize_images(image, size,method, align_corners)
image = tf.reshape(image, tf.stack([size[0], size[1], channels]))
return image

The bold code is an example of calling 'stack' Op explicitly. However, in most cases, when I have defined my model, some Op like 'strided_slice' and 'stack' will be added into GraphDef automatically.

 : I have tested your piece of code modified as below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;input = tf.placeholder(dtype = "float32", shape=(224, 224, 3))
indices = tf.placeholder(dtype = "int32", shape=(3))
expand = tf.expand_dims(input, 0)
out = tf.reshape(expand, tf.stack([indices[0], indices[1], indices[2]])) 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The GraphDef never contains any operator name as "Stack".
tf.stack() internally maps to "Pack" operator which was deprecated and removed in earlier Tensorflow version.
And TOCO can successfully translate "Pack" operator as TFLite runtime has it.
Note: I have tested above code in both Tensorflow 1.10 and 1.12. Both are good to go.
So i suggest you crosscheck your logs properly may be misleading info. If you are still sure this is the problem.
Then try a small test program which can reproduce the issue, and share it here, so that i can debug further.
Hope it helps.
