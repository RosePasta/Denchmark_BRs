	<summary>Conv2dTranspose layer creates additional operators on tflite conversion (Shape, Pack and Strided Slice)</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):  Binary
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source):  TF 2..3.0, TF Nightly

Command used to run the converter or code if youâ€™re using the Python API
If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model=tf.keras.models.load_model('amnv3seg.h5')

converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()
open("mnv3_seg_mew_2.3.tflite", "wb").write(tflite_model)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Failure details
The converted tflite model creates additonal shape , pack and strided slice operators and they are not supported by gpu delegate in android. The issue persists in TF 2.3 and TF Nightly.  The issue happens with or without bias parameter in Conv2dTranspose layer.
Any other info / logs
The original tf model is based on mobilenetv3 pretrained model and is available only in tf-nightly

		Was able to reproduce the issue with TF v2.3 and TF-nightly. Please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/e40b2d73d45566455a3ae21d1fdda398/44905.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		The issue is similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/45090#issuecomment-732389188&gt;#45090 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
It seems to be a problem associated with dynamic sizes in keras and the new convereter requires you to fix the batch size of input layer before tflite conversion
