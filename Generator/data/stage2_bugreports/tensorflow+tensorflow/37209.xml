	<summary>tensorflow.keras saving weights?</summary>
	<description>
I have a model that is run on a time series train set trying to predict stock prices. I never save or load the model or the weights but every time i run it with the save hyperparameters it keeps decreasing in accuracy. I don't understand why, is tensorflow.keras saving the weights or something?
