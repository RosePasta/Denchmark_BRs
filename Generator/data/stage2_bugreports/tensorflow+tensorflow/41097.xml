OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04


Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: No


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source


TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.0.2-0-g2c2fdd3205 2.0.2

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
I used the LibFuzzer to mutate an intact saved_model.pb file and uses LoadSavedModel C API to load it.
Instead of returning a Status whose .ok() is false, the program directly crashes with following errors:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-06-20 15:29:05.816403: I tensorflow/cc/saved_model/reader.cc:31] Reading SavedModel from: /home/xxx/Playground/tensorflow/saved_model/crashes

2020-06-20 15:29:05.829727: I tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader.cc:202] Restoring SavedModel bundle.
[libprotobuf FATAL external/com_google_protobuf/src/google/protobuf/map.h:1059] CHECK failed: it != end(): key not found: value

  what():  CHECK failed: it != end(): key not found: value
[1]    26722 abort (core dumped)  ./loader_test
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Since LoadSavedModel returns an Status object, the Status.ok() should return false, rather than a direct crash.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
#include "tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/saved_model/constants.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/saved_model/tag_constants.h"

#include &lt;fstream&gt;
using namespace tensorflow;
int main(){
        const string export_dir = "/home/xxx/Playground/saved_model/intact"; // original pb file --&gt; Status.ok() == true
        const string export_dir2 = "/home/xxx/Playground/saved_model/test"; // modified pb file --&gt; Status.ok() == false
        const string export_dir3 = "/home/xxx/Playground/saved_model/crashes"; // modified pb file --&gt; crash
        SavedModelBundle bundle;
        SessionOptions session_options;
        RunOptions run_options;
	    std::cout&lt;&lt;"hello"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
        if(LoadSavedModel(session_options, run_options, export_dir, {kSavedModelTagServe}, &amp;bundle).ok()){
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"Load Successful!"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
	}
	std::cout&lt;&lt;"-------------------------"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
	if(LoadSavedModel(session_options, run_options, export_dir2, {kSavedModelTagServe}, &amp;bundle).ok()){
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"Load Successful!"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
	}
	std::cout&lt;&lt;"-------------------------"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
	if(LoadSavedModel(session_options, run_options, export_dir3, {kSavedModelTagServe}, &amp;bundle).ok()){
		std::cout&lt;&lt;"Load Successful!"&lt;&lt;std::endl;
	}
	std::cout&lt;&lt;"-------------------------"&lt;&lt;std::endl;

    }

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/4874698/libfuzzer.output.txt&gt;libfuzzer output.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
I attached three saved_model.pb files and the log of libfuzzer as well.
Personal understanding
I think the following codes in tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/graph_properties.cc lead to the error
  Status MaybeUpdateNodeContextOutput(const NodeDef&amp; node, const bool is_fed,
                                      NodeContext* c) {
    // Propagate tensors and shape tensors unless the node is fed.
    // TODO(bsteiner) We should still propagate the shapes to the ports that
    // aren't fed in the case of a ShapeN node.

    InferenceContext* ic = c-&gt;inference_context.get();
    if (!is_fed) {
      if (IsConstant(node)) {
        c-&gt;output_tensor_protos.resize(1);
        const TensorProto&amp; tensor_proto = node.attr().at("value").tensor(); // at("xx") if "xx" does not exist will bring a crash
Once the value attribute cannot be obtained, an exception will be thrown.

Hi, this is an issue around tensorflow C API LoadSavedModel, I have attached the test code below.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/4877295/loader_test.zip&gt;loader_test.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 The assets files are uploaded in the previous post. Thank you.

		Hello, have any patches released for this bug?

		Hi.
Unfortunately, not yet. We encountered several delays due to other vulnerabilities needing to change a large part of the codebase. Since the patch release process takes a long time it's not worth issuing two separate patches in just a few months.
Apologies for the delays. I am working on this and looking for a release before end of September.

Thank you for the quick response. Will be patches released as single files or as a newer version of TF? Can I find them in release tags?

		Sorry for the delay.
The patches will be released on master as well as being cherrypicked on old release branches. Then, we will release patch versions of old releases.
For both the changes in master and the patch releases, there will be updates to the release notes.
There also be security advisories published, as well as CVE numbers assigned.
