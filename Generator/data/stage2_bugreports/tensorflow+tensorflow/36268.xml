	<summary>tf.debugging.assert_shapes() does not work for SparseTensor</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OS X 10.15
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1
Python version: 3.8

Describe the current behavior
tf.debugging.assert_shapes cannot be used with sparse tensors.
Describe the expected behavior
tf.debugging.assert_shapes should allow you to mix and match dense and sparse tensors when checking for dimensional consistency.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
A = tf.range(3)
tf.debugging.assert_shapes(((A, [3]),))  # works
# raises "ValueError: Attempt to convert a value (...) with an unsupported type (&lt;class 'tensorflow.python.framework.sparse_tensor.SparseTensor'&gt;) to a Tensor.
tf.debugging.assert_shapes(((tf.sparse.from_dense(A), [3]),))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

  I believe the input type of sparse_tensor is not the typical use-case for tf.debugging.assert_shapes. Neverthless it shouldn't raise the error.
I have made a PR to fix it: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/36277&gt;#36277&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please have a check if needed.

		This fixes it, but converting the sparse tensor to dense solely for the purpose of checking its shape seems quite wasteful to me.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/terhorst&gt;@terhorst&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I think this function is used for debugging only, right? If so, the efficiency shouldn't be the major problem. And I think this fix changes the least number of code which has lower possibility to induce other issues.

		In my case, the whole reason for using a SparseTensor in the first place is
that it cannot fit into memory as dense. With this patch, assert_shapes()
will produce an OOM or some other form of crash, which seems like a
regression since that is strictly more annoying and harder to debug than
mismatched dimensions. But, it's your call; my only point in submitting
this issue was to bring it to your attention, and I don't have the
bandwidth to learn how to patch it myself.

		I have tried on colab with TF version 2.1.0-rc2, 2.2.0-dev20200128 and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/76389a872dc7528d8ba29760a345c37b/untitled596.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
