	<summary>Documentation required for SetIsStateful() method in OP registration</summary>
	<description>
There are some examples with custom ops that use SetIsStateful() method during registration, e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/new_data_formats&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/new_data_formats&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But there is no documentation about that method.

		This is documented  in the underlying op_def.proto that REGISTER generates...



tensorflow/tensorflow/core/framework/op_def.proto


        Lines 125 to 133
      in
      0b13150






 // ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 



 // Optimization constraints. 



 



 // By default Ops may be moved between devices.  Stateful ops should 



 // either not be moved, or should only be moved if that state can also 



 // be moved (e.g. via some sort of save / restore). 



 // Stateful ops are guaranteed to never be optimized away by Common 



 // Subexpression Elimination (CSE). 



 bool is_stateful = 17;  // for things like variables, queue

		Ok, "mooving between devices"...
But why string ops does not have such constraint &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/string_ops.cc&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/string_ops.cc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It's still not clear.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shkarupa-alex&gt;@shkarupa-alex&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it looks like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aselle&gt;@aselle&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 answered the question. Reading the doc, I think the doc is clear enough for a reasonably skilled tensorflow developer. That's a tradeoff for conciseness. Feel free to submit a PR if you find a better wording.
