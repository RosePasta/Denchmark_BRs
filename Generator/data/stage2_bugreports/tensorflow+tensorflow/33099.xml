	<summary>possible file name typo in raspberry pi example</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/raspberry_pi&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/raspberry_pi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Near the bottom of the instruction on speeding up inference it reads
python3 classify_picamera.py \
Based on the files in that example folder should that instead read
python3 detect_picamera.py \
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If my assumption above is incorrect, then its unclear where the file classify_pycamera.py is coming from, and should maybe be explicitly mentioned.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I didnt plan to since its possibly a simple typo. But I can if you'd like.
