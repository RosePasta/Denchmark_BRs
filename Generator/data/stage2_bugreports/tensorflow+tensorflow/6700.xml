labels comes before logits, please excuse if i'm way off base, not sure where these docs are generated from

		Arg order change was introduced in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/333dc32ff79af21484695157f3d141dc776f7c02&gt;333dc32&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 ... I guess docs need to be regenerated?

		wow, isn't this going to break upgraded code in very hard to debug ways?

		This is one of a number of "hard to debug breaking changes" coming up in preparation to 1.0 release, documented &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c72d891418c326794a913cc13382c104255fe1f2/RELEASE.md#breaking-changes-to-the-api&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . The recommendation for backward compatibility is to not use any positional arguments but specify keywords explicitly

		And in fact, the new interface disallows positional arguments for that
exact reason.

		Some other function, e.g. sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits also have this breaking change. These need to be documented in RELEASE.md.
But in one function: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/functions_and_classes/shard8/tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits.md&gt;tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , positional arguments are not disallowed. This may lead to silent failure.

		That's a good point. We should enforce names args for that function as
well.

		argument order was addressed in 1.0 with scripts for compatibility to add named fields (for google searches)
