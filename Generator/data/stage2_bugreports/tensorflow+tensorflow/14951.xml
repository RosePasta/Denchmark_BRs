	<summary>Document S3 `S3_REGION` constant</summary>
	<description>
This gave me a lot of grief recently as the AWS Region for S3 is controlled by an undocumented constant S3_REGION which defaults to us-east-1 unless defined on the system-level. Extra frustrating as it departs from the common naming practice: AWS_REGION:



tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/s3/s3_file_system.cc


         Line 52
      in
      79422ab






 const char* region = getenv("S3_REGION"); 





If somebody could suggest where to document this, I'd be happy to contribute.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jhseu&gt;@jhseu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, do you think we should support both and just fallback or just document it?

		Yeah, if there's a common practice here, we should use that and deprecate the other environment variable in TF 2.0.

		The S3_REGION was introduced in PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/11089&gt;#11089&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Sorry about the confusion on AWS_REGION vs. S3_REGION.  I will create a PR to add AWS_REGION support shortly.

		Added a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/14984&gt;#14984&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the fix. Please take a look.
