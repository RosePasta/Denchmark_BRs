		I can confirm the issue. This was very confusing, I was sure I was logging incorrectly. I downgraded to 0.7 and Tensorboard functioned beautifully.
4.2.5-1-ARCH
0.8.0rc0
tried in Firefox
Installed using pip
UPDATE
I just confirmed this was fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1926&gt;#1926&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
