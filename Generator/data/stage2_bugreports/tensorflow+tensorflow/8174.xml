	<summary>tfdbg requires external ncurses on OSX</summary>
	<description>

OSX 10.11.6
TF from source at 8746f8ac9 (master HEAD from a few hours ago) without GPU
XCode 8.2.1

When loading it, tfdbg crashes with a curses-related error. Was solved with brew install homebrew/dupes/ncurses. If this is really a dependency, it would be useful to mention it in the documentation or installation guide.

 thanks for reporting this issue. Yes, curses/ncurses is a dependency for tfdbg on OSX. I will document it better in the next release.

		Great, thanks! Good to know I didn't mess anything up.
It also seems Terminal.app sends by default some weird character when pressing the delete key, and requires enabling the "Delete sends Control-H" option for the backspace to work. Not sure if this could be considered a bug -- maybe just having it on the FAQ or docs as well will be enough.

 Yep, we are aware that there are keybinding issues on Mac. There is an internal bug tracking that.

		This is fixed. See the last Q&amp;A "What are the platform-specific system requirements of tfdbg CLI in open-source TensorFlow?"  here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger#frequently_asked_questions&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger#frequently_asked_questions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
