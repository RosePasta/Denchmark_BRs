	<summary>No examples showing how to generate Arduino files from source for Arduino IDE</summary>
	<description>
Thank you for submitting a TensorFlow documentation issue. Per our GitHub
policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests, and
build/installation issues on GitHub.
The TensorFlow docs are open source! To get involved, read the documentation
contributor guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/MyMethod&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/MyMethod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No examples of generating Arduino IDE specific files from source (.cc) files
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is documentation and code (generate_microlite_projects() function,transform_arduino_source.py, etc.) suggesting that the Make build system allows for easily creating files and a directory from source files to be used in the Arduino IDE but there are no Arduino examples that show how this is or should be done.
It would be useful to show how the hello_world project example was built for the Arduino IDE from the repo's source using Make.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Usage example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is there a usage example?
Not for Arduino.
