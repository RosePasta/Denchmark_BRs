	<summary>In the pix2pix tutorial, the dimension of upsample within up_stack looks wrong. Only the image size is doubled, not filters!</summary>

		In the cell of Define a Generator: I think the dimension after 1st
upsample(512, 4, apply_dropout=True) ,  ### (bs, 2,2, 512), and so on...
otherwise the dimensions do not match with skip layers below.

up_stack = [
upsample(512, 4, apply_dropout=True), # (bs, 2, 2, 1024) ---&gt; should be
(bs, 2,2, 512)
upsample(512, 4, apply_dropout=True), # (bs, 4, 4, 1024) ---&gt; should be
(bs, 4, 4, 512)
upsample(512, 4, apply_dropout=True), # (bs, 8, 8, 1024) ---&gt; should be
(bs, 8, 8, 512)
upsample(512, 4), # (bs, 16, 16, 1024) ---&gt; should be (bs, 16, 16, 512)
upsample(256, 4), # (bs, 32, 32, 512) ---&gt; should be (bs, 32, 32, 256)
upsample(128, 4), # (bs, 64, 64, 256) ---&gt; should be (bs, 64, 64, 128)
upsample(64, 4), # (bs, 128, 128, 128) ---&gt; should be (bs, 128, 128, 64)

		Thanks. That notebook lives over here in the tensorflow/docs repo: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/pix2pix.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/pix2pix.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you send a pull request, please?

		I think, the up_stack comments are referring to the shapes after the concatenation with the skip connection.

		yeah, "after the concatenation with the skip connection"  makes sense.

Thanks
