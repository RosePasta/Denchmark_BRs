	<summary>possible bug in examples/speech_commands/test_streaming_accuracy.cc</summary>
	<description>
in tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/test_streaming_accuracy.cc line 247 the following code is not correct:
const int64 audio_data_end = (sample_count - clip_duration_ms);
it should be corrected as follows:
const int64 audio_data_end = (sample_count - clip_duration_samples);
it is wrong because the dimensions do not match. sample_count is in units [sample] but clip_duration_ms is in [ms] units.
Additionally it gives the following error:
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
but if audio_data_end is set correctly as i mentioned above, this error would not occur.

 I think you are correct, do you want to create a PR for that?

  Well I don't have a plan to create a PR for now but if it is actually a bug, I hope it gets corrected in the master branch in the future.
