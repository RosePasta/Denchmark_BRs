	<summary>Error 404 when downloading Tensorflow on Windows</summary>
	<description>
The links provided on the website to the .whl used to install Tensorflow on Windows seem to be broken : &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#pip_installation_on_windows&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#pip_installation_on_windows&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm getting an HTTP Error 404.
I found the CPU Build elsewhere but I can't find the GPU build which I would like tu use.

		Probably same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6275&gt;#6275&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
While it's getting fixed could you try with this link for CPU:
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
And for GPU downloading the nightly build wheel on:
http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-win/14/DEVICE=gpu,OS=windows/
Another alternative is to run:
pip install tensorflow
and for gpu support:
pip install tensorflow-gpu

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yifeif&gt;@yifeif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Can we modify the website to point at the existing RC? (I think it's broken for all operating systems right now, but it mostly seems to be Windows users who're affected for some reason....)

		The windows links from tensorflow website should be working now. Sorry for the inconvenience.
