	<summary>Add Python Graph Transform examples</summary>
	<description>
The docs for the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d699a66e940b26e991b29b27f4e3ad2e8e3282d2/tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/README.md#writing-your-own-transforms&gt;Graph Transform Tool&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 talk about writing your own transforms but way to do so is in C++. It would be cool if there was an example of / c++ hook writing transforms in Python as well. For example, here is one Python transform (by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry&gt;@mrry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
): &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/40852855/2638485&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/a/40852855/2638485&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

).

		There also seem to be an entire set of python graph transforms: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/tools&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/tools&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 might have thoughts on this.

		The rewrite scripts in python/tools are deprecated in favor of the Graph Transform Tool (and I need to update them to reflect that). In general, we're trying to make as much functionality as possible available across multiple languages, which means implementing core operations in C++ and exposing them through APIs. We're still happy to see user transforms written in Python, we've just chosen to take a different approach for these. Unfortunately that means we don't have 'canonical' examples of writing them in Python, as you've seen.

 we'd welcome community contributions in this regard!

		The docs for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dc6353d12fd41ec869283679dd7766ebff75c520/tensorflow/docs_src/performance/quantization.md&gt;quantization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should also probably be updated to point to the new graph transform tool.

		I am interested in working on this. How do I start?
