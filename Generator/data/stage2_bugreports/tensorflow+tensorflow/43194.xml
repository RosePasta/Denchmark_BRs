Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" v7.6

Hello everyone,
I have just tried to use pre-trained ResNet50 with tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(**args). The thing is happening for me is that after downloading weights, nothing else happens!! even after a couple of hours it does not go any further!! Any idea? what may be the casue of this? Any solution?
Many thanks for your help in advance.
I use as follow:
ENCODER_BASE = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False,input_shape=(None,None,3), weights='imagenet')

		Thanks for your reply.
I get the issue just with running of below simple code:
import tensorflow as tf
ENCODER_BASE = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False,input_shape=(None,None,3),weights='imagenet')
Note: once I run the above line on my laptop ( it is only cpu), it is fine and works. But as I run on our GPU cluster the issue raises. It also uses the almost full capacity of the GPU 32GB.
Thanks.

I have tried in colab with TF-GPU version 2.3.0 and i am not seeing any issue. Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/7e9c0cd69f0b5527ed6f1717d4faa62c/untitled346.ipynb&gt;here.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks but once I tried for TF-GPU version 2.2.0 which is mine it fails.  Would you please take a look &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o6s4aWBtV3O4RzmD5i7fPWfUvgZid90v#scrollTo=u76PSye_TOdD&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please, grant me the access for the colab link you have provided.Also, please check you are facing the same issue with the latest version of Tensorflow ie. 2.3. Thanks!
