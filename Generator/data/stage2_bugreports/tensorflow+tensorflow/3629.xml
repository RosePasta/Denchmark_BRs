	<summary>Problems in "Implement the gradient in Python" docs</summary>
	<description>
Referring to the docs &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/adding_an_op/index.html#implement-the-gradient-in-python&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

First of all, the chain rule is completely wrong. Also the ZeroOut example is not a very good one IMO... would be much better to give e.g. a simple derivative of a polynomial or something. Just a FYI.
EDIT: I'd like to emphasize that the chain rule is embarrasingly wrong...

 It's only embarrassingly wrong if one is irrationally embarrassed by making mistakes!

 To clarify: by "embarrassingly wrong" all you mean is that it should be  to avoid implying that  is differentiating ?

		Yup, exactly! Was a bit tired yesterday so maybe I overreacted a bit though :)
Anyway, for example the abs + it's gradient would probably make for a better example?

		Oops actually maybe  is not a good example, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/3647&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (possible) bug.

 Are you happy with this chain rule fix?  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/girving/tensorflow/commit/05e7bc317317cc868710db2762acaab87b8c17a4&gt;girving@05e7bc3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Sure, that's much better!

		So the PR to fix the chain rule mention is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/3650&gt;#3650&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  As for the example, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/harpone&gt;@harpone&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: do you want to personally fix it?  It's a nontrivial amount of work for a marginal gain, since the goal of the tutorial is to teach people how to use the API, not to teach them calculus.

		I'm afraid I don't have the time right now, but I may submit a PR related
on another thing (log abs det gradient etc.) some time in the future, so I
could also do this in the same PR? No promises however, it could take a
while...

 That sounds like it should be a separate PR.  I'll close this one for now.
