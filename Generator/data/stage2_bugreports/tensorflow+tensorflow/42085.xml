You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
Hi. I'm trying to serve our model on Pixel3(Android 10), using TFLite's GPU backend.
But, this error makes our app crash. (Both of tensorflow-lite-gpu:2.2.0 and 0.0.0-nightly)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  Process: org.tensorflow.lite.examples.posenet, PID: 30052
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Internal error: Failed to apply delegate: Next operations are not supported by GPU delegate:
    SUM: Operation is not supported.
    First 141 operations will run on the GPU, and the remaining 7 on the CPU.
    TfLiteGpuDelegate Init: MUL: 1024x131  cannot be reduced to linear.
    TfLiteGpuDelegate Prepare: delegate is not initialized
    Node number 148 (TfLiteGpuDelegateV2) failed to prepare.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The error is "TfLiteGpuDelegate Init: MUL: 1024x131  cannot be reduced to linear."
What is the matter and what can I do to utilize TfLiteGPUDelegate?
Describe the expected behavior

 Actually, No.
I just replaced 'MUL' to 'MATMUL', which is 'FullyConnected' in TFLite.
