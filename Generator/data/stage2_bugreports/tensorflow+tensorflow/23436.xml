	<summary>Tensorflow crashes on source building!!!</summary>
	<description>
System information

Linux Ubuntu 18.04.1):
No mobile problem
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
TensorFlow version: 1.11.0
Python version: 2.7.15rc1
Haven't done any pip installation
Bazel version: Build label: 0.19.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 7.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: Not relevant

I am trying to install Tensorflow, but I keep getting the same problem when I use this command to build it:
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package //tensorflow:libtensorflow_framework.so
Command sequence:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
./configure
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package //tensorflow:libtensorflow_framework.so
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The output I get:
ERROR: /root/tensorflow/tensorflow/python/BUILD:371:1: C++ compilation of rule '//tensorflow/python:ndarray_tensor' failed (Exit 1) gcc failed: error executing command /usr/bin/gcc -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -fstack-protector -Wall -B/usr/bin -B/usr/bin -Wunused-but-set-parameter -Wno-free-nonheap-object -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g0 -O2 '-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1' -DNDEBUG ...

  -  Using Bazel 0.15 and GCC 4.8 should not cause this issue. Try with the below combination.
Also try restarting the system.

		I almost got it working, I am using this code at the end of my script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;filepath = "RNN_Final-{epoch:02d }-{val_acc:.3f}"

#Saves only the best ones
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint("models/{}.model".format(filepath, monitor='val_acc', verbose=1, save_best_only=True, mode='max'))

history = model.fit(
    train_x, train_y,
    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    epochs=EPOCHS,
    validation_data=(validation_x, validation_y),
    callbacks=[tensorboard, checkpoint])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And this is the error I get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/var/www/test.nl/test.py", line 162, in &lt;module&gt;
    callbacks=[tensorboard, checkpoint])
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py", line 1605, in fit
    validation_steps=validation_steps)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training_arrays.py", line 238, in fit_loop
    callbacks.on_epoch_end(epoch, epoch_logs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py", line 214, in on_epoch_end
    callback.on_epoch_end(epoch, logs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/callbacks.py", line 568, in on_epoch_end
    filepath = self.filepath.format(epoch=epoch + 1, **logs)
ValueError: Invalid conversion specification
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The script crashes on this line:
callbacks=[tensorboard, checkpoint])
What can I do, or what am I doing wrong?

		The build seems to have succeeded, but this is an issue with using keras callbacks.

  Any inputs on this please ?

		Any help on how to fix the Python.h problem? I've fed "-isystem/usr/include/python2.7" to both --cxxopts for Bazel, or as extra flags to use when configuring Tensorflow, it's just missing in the compile command (as shown with --verbose_failures). I don't know enough about the tool chains here to understand where do I need to wrench it in...
Or if somebody could tell me which process is supposed to be used to make sure that the build picks up Python include directory, I can try figuring out why isn't it working in some cases...

		For anybody else who gets stuck on the Python thing - yes, the python development package needs to be installed, but if it's done after configure was ran, you'd need to blow stuff away. I don't know how much stuff needed to be (blown away), I removed Bazel cache directory, and cloned Tensorflow again, that did it.

		Did you do ./configure again?

 as far as I can remember - yes.

 I know this is a stale issue. If this is still an issue, can you please share a simple standalone code to reproduce the issue? Thanks!
