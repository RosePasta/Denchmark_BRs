		Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the code snippet to reproduce the issue. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;Github new issue template.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!
