Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/where#args_1&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/where#args_1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

For Args "x".
Original:
If provided, a Tensor which is of the same type as y, and has a shape broadcastable with condition and y.

		x and y are two tensors. On the description of x we are saying that x has the same type as the y tensor.

		Thanks for the update. In that case, it looks like the document problem is with "y".
Original:
y | If provided, a Tensor which is of the same type as y, and has a shape broadcastable with condition and x.
Should be:
y | If provided, a Tensor which is of the same type as x, and has a shape broadcastable with condition and x.

		Thanks! But the main website &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/where&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/where&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
