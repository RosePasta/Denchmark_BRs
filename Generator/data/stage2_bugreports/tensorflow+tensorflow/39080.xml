		The  is deprecated. We recommend using &lt;denchmark-link:https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/04/quantization-aware-training-with-tensorflow-model-optimization-toolkit.html&gt;post-training quantization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/04/quantization-aware-training-with-tensorflow-model-optimization-toolkit.html&gt;quantization aware training&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 approach with TF 2.X
Thanks!
