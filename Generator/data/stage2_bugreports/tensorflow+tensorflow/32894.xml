		If you are looking for  docs, then here is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.13/api_docs/python/tf&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
However, I do recommend you to upgrade to newer version of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I believe that  is removed in Tensorflow 2.0 so you should take that in consideration (find alternative).
In TF2, there is &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d_transpose&gt;conv2d_transpose&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
