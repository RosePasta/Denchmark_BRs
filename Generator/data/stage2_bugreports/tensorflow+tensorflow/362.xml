	<summary>Some wrong code in get_started document</summary>
	<description>
On your get started website &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/basic_usage.html#basic-usage&gt;http://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/basic_usage.html#basic-usage&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I found a small piece of wrong code:
In the sample code of Feeds section:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;input1 = tf.placeholder(tf.types.float32)
input2 = tf.placeholder(tf.types.float32)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tried them and python gave the AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'types'
After reading the document &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org/resources/dims_types.html&gt;http://www.tensorflow.org/resources/dims_types.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think it should be  instead of .  Probably it's a version issue?

		Again I found very minor wrong number in the tutorial: &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html#mnist-for-ml-beginners&gt;http://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html#mnist-for-ml-beginners&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It mentions the shape of training images are [60000, 784], but actually [55000, 784]; also for the labels: [55000, 10] instead of [60000, 10].

		Thanks! it does help!!!!
Now I'm studying the newly tensorflow version based on the windows platform, and some demo codes of the guide TENSORFLOW.ORG gave do have some error, probably this guide is for python version 2.x, but the new tensorflow is based on python version 3.5.x.....

 If you have links to the tutorials that don't work in Python 3.5.x, please send them in a new issue (or sending a pull request that fixes them would be even better!).
