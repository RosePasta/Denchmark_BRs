	<summary>Tutorial on contrib (load_csv) no longer works, please suggest solution</summary>
	<description>
I try to follow the turotial here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/tflearn/index.html&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/tflearn/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I get the error:
221:tensorflow_tutorial ME$ python contrib_learn_quick_origin.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "contrib_learn_quick_origin.py", line 13, in 
training_set = tf.contrib.learn.datasets.base.load_csv(filename=IRIS_TRAINING,
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'load_csv'
Please suggests solutions and edit the online tutorial.

		Hi,
im afraid it still doesnt work with the changes. The new method takes 3 arguments instead of 2. This is how i made it work:
training_set = tf.contrib.learn.datasets.base.load_csv_with_header( filename=IRIS_TRAINING, target_dtype=np.int, features_dtype=np.float32) test_set = tf.contrib.learn.datasets.base.load_csv_with_header( filename=IRIS_TEST, target_dtype=np.int, features_dtype=np.float32)
EDIT: Ive tried to change it according to your commit.

		Also, the example files don't exist, so even changing the code will fail -- the files iris_test.csv and  iris_train.csv need to be committed.

		Hey,
You can see the changed file and the .csv files here at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/monitors&gt;TensorFlow github page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/monitors&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/monitors&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Download the files to a folder and change:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Data sets
IRIS_TRAINING = "iris_training.csv"
IRIS_TEST = "iris_test.csv"

to

# Data sets
IRIS_TRAINING = "&lt;path_to_file&gt;/iris_training.csv"
IRIS_TEST = "&lt;path_to_file&gt;/iris_test.csv"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		If you read through the tutorial, it provides the datasets and says to download into the same file as your python script.
