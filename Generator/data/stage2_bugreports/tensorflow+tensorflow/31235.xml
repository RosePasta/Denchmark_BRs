Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): kinda
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 16.04LTS Ubuntu
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): conda forge
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.14.0
Python version: 2.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9
GPU model and memory: Quadrao 16GB

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 

I am trying to move some of Keras's image &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras-preprocessing/blob/master/keras_preprocessing/image/affine_transformations.py&gt;transformation functions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 into my dataset constructor function, e.g.
# inside my function that makes a dataset
filenames = [...]

preprocess_fn = lambda p: preprocess_image(p, some, default, arguments)

# workaround as shown by @mrry in https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12396
tf_preproc_fn = lambda p: tf.numpy_function(preprocess_fn, [p], tf.float32)

path_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(fullpaths)
imgs_ds = path_ds.map(tf_preproc_fn, num_parallel_calls=AUTOTUNE)

where  at somepoint in preprocess_fn np.rollaxis is called, which in turns calls np.transpose. this throws:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
  File "/home/user/anaconda3/envs/tf/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/numeric.py", line 1554, in rollaxis
    return a.transpose(axes)

AttributeError: 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor' object has no attribute 'transpose'


	 [[{{node PyFunc}}]] [Op:IteratorGetNextSync]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
That tf.numpy_function just "works". Already had to use tf.cast(tensor.shape[0], tf.float32) to prevent some errors.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
# from keras
def apply_channel_shift(x:list, intensity:float, channel_axis:int=0)-&gt;list:
    '''
    Performs a channel shift.

    Arguments
        x (np.ndarray): Input tensor. Must be 3D.
        intensity (float): Transformation intensity.
        channel_axis (int): Index of axis for channels in the input tensor.

    Returns
        Numpy image tensor.
    '''
    x = np.rollaxis(x, channel_axis, 0)
    min_x, max_x = np.min(x), np.max(x)
    channel_images = [
        np.clip(x_channel + intensity,
                min_x,
                max_x)
        for x_channel in x]
    x = np.stack(channel_images, axis=0)
    x = np.rollaxis(x, 0, channel_axis + 1)
    return x

_fn = lambda img_tnsr : apply_channel_shift(img_tnsr, 1, 3)
tf_fn = tf.numpy_function(lambda i: _fn(i), [i], [tf.float32])

path_ds.map(tf_fn)

Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
