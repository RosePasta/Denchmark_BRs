System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
python notebook using python v3.7.


Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary


TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0-beta
tfrecord-example-with-tfdata.ipynb.zip


Python version: 3.7


Bazel version (if compiling from source):


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):


CUDA/cuDNN version:


GPU model and memory: Deep learning VM available on GCP


You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 

I am following the tutorial at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/load_data/tf_records#writing_a_tfrecord_file&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/load_data/tf_records#writing_a_tfrecord_file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
I should be able to save the file.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
See attached python notebook
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Was able to reproduce the issue with Tensorflow 2.0.0.beta1 on my system. Thanks!

		When you write (let's say, in eager mode, since that's simpler), you need to iterate through the dataset. In the relevant cell of your notebook:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;writer = tf.compat.v1.data.experimental.TFRecordWriter(filename)
for features in serialized_features_dataset:
  writer.write(features)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This doesn't look like a bug in TensorFlow to me (of course I may be missing something). Please open a new issue if I am mistaken.
