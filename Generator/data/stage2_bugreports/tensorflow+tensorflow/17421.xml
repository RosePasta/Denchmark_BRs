&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am using resnet_v2 provided in slim to train a classifier. However, there is an unexpected behaviour when I tried to get the predictions on test set and I am sure that I turned off the training mode by pass is_training as False.
My model returned unreasonable prediction scores on specific testing mini batch size of 650 and 649.
I randomly checked several testing batch sizes (from 50 - 850, which my GPU can afford ), their predictions on same input data were all consistent with each other, except for size 650 and 649.  Actually even two identical patches in the mini batch had different scores when I am using batch size 650 and 649.  To verify the issue, I also tried to train the model with different input data and different training mini batch size. However, the problem is still there with the same weird mini batch size 650 and 649 :(.

		It has been 14 days with no activity and the awaiting response label was assigned. Is this still an issue?
