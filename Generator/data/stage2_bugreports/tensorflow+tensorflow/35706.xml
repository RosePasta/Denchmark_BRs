	<summary>Init operations did not make model ready. When import form .pbtxt</summary>
	<description>
System information

Ubuntu 16.04:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.13.1
Python version: 3.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0 / 7.5
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA RTX 2080TI

I am trying the tf.io.write_graph() and tf.import_graph_def API to implement model saving and re-building. And I encountered "Init operations did not make model ready" when importing the graph_def into MonitoredSession()
Here is the importing related source code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Some code to load graph_def from .pbtxt file
tf.reset_default_graph()
tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession() as sess:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The bug information is:
RuntimeError: Init operations did not make model ready.  Init op: group_deps, init fn: None, local_init_op: name: "group_deps_1"
op: "NoOp"
input: "^init_2"
input: "^init_all_tables"
input: "^init_3"
, error: Variables not initialized: global_step, ......

Thanks for your response, Here is the complete code to reproduce the issue:
The input file is a .pbtxt file exported using
tf.io.write_graph(sess.graph_def, '.', â€˜validation.pbtxt')
Here is the code to reproduce the bug (I just reproduced it now)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
from google.protobuf import text_format
with open('validation.pbtxt', 'r') as fdin:
    file_content = fdin.read()
    try:
        graph_def = text_format.Parse(file_content, tf.GraphDef())
    except text_format.ParseError as e:
        raise IOError("Cannot parse file %s: %s."
                        % (filename, str(e)))
tf.reset_default_graph()
tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')
with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession() as sess:
        sess.graph.as_default()
# Report error
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

You may refer #14391

Hi ymodak, I tried the solution in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/14391&gt;#14391&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that add a new checkpoint folder in the session parameter like this:

However, I still meet the same bug.
It seems that just change the checkpoint is not enough. Do we also need to write the init function by ourselves?
