System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian GNU/Linux 9
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below):2.3.1
Python version:3.7.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):6.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA Version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: Tesla T4 * 2

Describe the current behavior
When I remove the “tf.summary.write(tag="prediction_" + key, tensor=prediction_concat, step=batch)”, it works well without error.
But With “tf.summary.write(tag="prediction_" + key, tensor=prediction_concat, step=batch)”. It has the error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.UnknownError: 3 root error(s) found.
(0) Unknown:  Failed to get convolution algorithm. This is probably because cuDNN failed to initialize, so try looking to see if a warning log message was printed above.

Describe the expected behavior
in the infer() function, the result from serving func will be written as tfevents by tf.summary.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZhixinLai&gt;@ZhixinLai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I was able to reproduce this issue on GCP with two T4 GPUs. While I'm not quite sure what the problem here is, it's always a good idea to make sure your code works first without distribution before adding MirroredStrategy. I replaced the line  with , which will run your code with the default strategy (ie no distribution). I'm seeing a different error now:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;prediction_tensor = prediction_perReplica[key].values
AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'values'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Try this out and let me know if this helps you debug.

Hi @ZhixinLai, I was able to reproduce this issue on GCP with two T4 GPUs. While I'm not quite sure what the problem here is, it's always a good idea to make sure your code works first without distribution before adding MirroredStrategy. I replaced the line strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() with strategy = tf.distribute.get_strategy(), which will run your code with the default strategy (ie no distribution). I'm seeing a different error now:
prediction_tensor = prediction_perReplica[key].values
AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'values'

Try this out and let me know if this helps you debug.

Thanks for your help &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nikitamaia&gt;@nikitamaia&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . With tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(), I want to get the result from different devices, and the return result is perReplica tensor type, which is similar to a dict. In order to get the values, I use the .values. I got the idea from the discussion:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57549448/how-to-convert-perreplica-to-tensor&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57549448/how-to-convert-perreplica-to-tensor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You are right, in order to make it run successfully with single GPU, we'd better write like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if strategy.num_replicas_in_sync &gt; 1:
    predicition_tensors = prediction_perReplica[key].values
else:
    predicition_tensors = prediction_perReplica[key]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But the code needs to be run with multi GPUs eventually, and thus we still need tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() and get value from perReplica tensor with .values.

		Ah okay. It sounds like what you're looking for is  ? This has been added to nightly. Please &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/Strategy?version=nightly#gather&gt;have a look at the nightly docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and examples for  and let me know if this achieves the desired functionally.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZhixinLai&gt;@ZhixinLai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I'm taking a second look at this code and I am able to run it without error. I ran it with 2.3 using two T4s, and also tried running in nightly. Are you still facing problems? Have you tried running in nightly?
