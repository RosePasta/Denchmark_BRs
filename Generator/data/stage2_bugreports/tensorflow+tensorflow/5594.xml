	<summary>Doc Errors related to  tf.space_to_batch</summary>
	<description>
In the&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/array_ops.md#tfspace_to_batchinput-paddings-block_size-namenone-space_to_batch&gt; api-doc related to&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , the result of example case of

(3) For the following input of shape [1, 4, 4, 1] and block_size of 2:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = [[[[1],   [2],  [3],  [4]],
      [[5],   [6],  [7],  [8]],
      [[9],  [10], [11],  [12]],
      [[13], [14], [15],  [16]]]]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

should be
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = [[[[1], [3]], [[9], [11]]],
     [[[2], [4]], [[10], [12]]],
     [[[5], [7]], [[13], [15]]],
     [[[6], [8]], [[14], [16]]]]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

rather than
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = [[[[1], [3]], [[5], [7]]],
     [[[2], [4]], [[10], [12]]],
     [[[5], [7]], [[13], [15]]],
     [[[6], [8]], [[14], [16]]]]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Docs related to tf.space_to_batch_nd, tf.batch_to_space_nd, tf.batch_to_space have similar problems in their (3) cases, too.

 Does this look right to you?

		The new  doc link is here, and it does seem to have  the problem still and prettyprint shown in all examples.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/space_to_batch&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/space_to_batch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This is fixed in master:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/space_to_batch&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/space_to_batch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and in v1.2:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/space_to_batch&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/space_to_batch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The quoted link will get fixed automatically when we switch v1.2.  We generally don't cherrypick back cosmetic change like this, so r1.1 will have this for the foreseeable future.  I think we can close this.
