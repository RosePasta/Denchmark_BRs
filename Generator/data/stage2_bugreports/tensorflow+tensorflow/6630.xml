	<summary>[Docs] A mismatch bug in api_docs</summary>
	<description>
There is a mismatch bug in api_docs about &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/framework/core_graph_data_structures#Graph&gt;tf.graph&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It's easy to find that  is a error. And I check the original script &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py#L2003&gt;ops.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it seems like the  is added by other script.
At the same time, it causes the index  ineffectively.

 Could you have a look? And re-pin the corresponding reviewer?

		Right, it's incorrectly parsed by the markdown. Looping internally. We have a new version of the docs coming soon so we might not fix this one.

		Yes, I think the {} anchors will go away entirely.

 Yep, I do agree with you. It's not a separate problem, but a more general issue of markdown parser. Look forward to the new version of G3docs.
