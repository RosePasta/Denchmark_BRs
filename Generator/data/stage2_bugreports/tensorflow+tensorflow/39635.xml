	<summary>Bug in tf.keras bidirectional LSTM when time_major is true</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Macos Mojave 10.14.6
TensorFlow installed from: Binary
TensorFlow version: v2.2.0-rc4-8-g2b96f3662b 2.2.0
Python version: 3.6.3

Bug description
When using bidirectional layer with forward/backward lstms with time_major=True and merge mode concat(same issue exists in other modes too), it produces incorrect results due to the below line:



tensorflow/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/wrappers.py


         Line 658
      in
      2b96f36






 y_rev = K.reverse(y_rev, 1) 





If time_major=true (the input shape of bidi lstm is - [seq_len, batch_size, hidden_size]), axis 1 represents batch dimesnion and we end up reversing y_rev in batch dimension before concatenation while it should have been reversed in the dimension representing seq_len(axis 0).
This works fine when LSTM is time_major=False as in that case axis 1 represents seq_len.  Ideally it should see which axis - axis 0 or axis 1 represent the time dimension and reverse on that axis, instead of generically reversing on axis 1.
Could you please fix this bug as the time_major version of the lstms is more efficient.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

seq_len = 2
batch_size = 1
feature_dim = 1

input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(seq_len, feature_dim))
# Transpose input to be time major
input_transposed = tf.transpose(input, perm=[1,0,2])
output = tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(1, return_sequences=True, time_major=True), name='bi')(input_transposed)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)

# Set all the weights to be one for simplicity
rnn_layer = model.get_layer('bi')
weights = rnn_layer.get_weights()
new_w = [np.ones(x, dtype=np.float32) for x in [(feature_dim, 4), (1, 4), (4)] * 2]
rnn_layer.set_weights(new_w)

model.save("test.h5")
x = np.ones((batch_size, seq_len, feature_dim), dtype=np.float32)
expected = model.predict(x)
print(expected)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected result is :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[[[0.6082834  0.87263733]    
  [0.87263733 0.6082834 ]]]
which is:
[[[ forward_layer_seq_1, backward_layer_seq_1 ]]
 [[ forward_layer_seq_2, backward_layer_seq_2]]]
But what we get is:
[[[0.6082834  0.6082834 ]]
 [[0.87263733 0.87263733]]]
[[[ forward_layer_seq_1, backward_layer_seq_2 ]]
 [[ forward_layer_seq_2, backward_layer_seq_1]]]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have tried in colab with TF nightly version (2.3.0-dev20200518) and i am not seeing any issue in nightly version.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/ddebb9a159077acb4072d6a8aad25cab/untitled899.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.You could use tf-nightly for now and in the next couple of months new stable version will be released.Please, close this thread if your issue got resolved. Thanks!

		Yes I see that its fixed in master branch:



tensorflow/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/wrappers.py


         Line 656
      in
      ef45324






 time_dim = 0 if getattr(self.forward_layer, 'time_major', False) else 1 





Looks like it got fixed by this commit last month - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1a09bbf34ea07713a66cc4385800ab2744587884&gt;1a09bbf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I am also not able to reproduce it with tf-nightly. Thanks will close this.
