Describe the expected behavior
model.evaluate should not raise this error after training.

Code and log:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/matthew-z/e5848d545b60792dd84bfb9470ea541f&gt;https://gist.github.com/matthew-z/e5848d545b60792dd84bfb9470ea541f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tested with this machine on GCE:

n1-standard-4
1 x NVIDIA Tesla V100
image: c1-deeplearning-common-cu100-20191003 (Google Deep Learning VM, common-dl-gpu)
installed anaconda3, CUDNN 7.6.4.38 (got some errors with the original 7.4 CUDNN in the image), tensorflow-gpu 2.0

Other info / logs
The problem may not happen with CPU.

		I have tried on colab with TF version 2.0  and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/039e4a49146a41cc220c28b3e2b7cacb/untitled266.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

		I can reproduce this issue.
Somehow I don't think its a LSTM issue since the error log didn't indicate anything about LSTM. Also when I change the LSTM layer to SimpleRNN, the issue still persists.
The other experiment I did was change "experimental_run_tf_function=False" in model.compile(), which will let model run in func graph mode, and the issue goes away. So I think there is some issue for the training function in v2.
For now, you can set the "experimental_run_tf_function=False" to walk around the issue. We will dig deep to find the root cause.
Thanks.

		Just tested tested same code again with the latest tf-nigthly and it runs fine now.
