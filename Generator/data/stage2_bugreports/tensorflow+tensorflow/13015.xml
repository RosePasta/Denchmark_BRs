	<summary>Ubuntu installation instruction is too obsolete!</summary>
	<description>
For successful build on Ubuntu it's required to do much more than stated on the installation instructions!
My system:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CUDA support: YES
Bazel: 0.5.4
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.1-8ubuntu1) 5.4.1 20170304
Linux Desktop 4.10.0-33-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 11 10:55:28 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
CPU i7-7820x (with AVX512 support)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It's required change the build command:
bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda --cxxopt="-fabi-version=0" //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --verbose_failures
And it's still not enough :( I still can't make successful build...

		Are you missing the configure step?

		No, of course. The issue happens after compiling 3500 source files.

		It looks like problem with _mm512_insertf64x2 is caused by gcc 4 - it doesn't support avx512. Of course, compilation must be successful anyway. But even gcc 5 doesn't work with another error :( Nothing works at all.
It's so disappointing. I can't build tensorflow for a week on macOS, Windows and Ubuntu using hundreds of different compilation options, but always with GPU support. Without GPU support it works on Ubuntu.
I believe that it happens because of my CPU (Intel Skylake - i7-7820X). Please, anybody who can understand what's going on, help me!

		More information about errors that I get both with gcc-4.9 and gcc-5: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/13014&gt;#13014&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The current issue report is about obsolete installation instruction and incorrect build command in it.

		Only gcc-4.8 works fine on the new CPUs. Please update installation instruction.

		Hi, no matter for me with this command line : "bazel build -c opt --copt=-mavx --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-mfma --copt=-mfpmath=both --config=cuda -k //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package"

		These installation instructions have been updated several times since this bug was opened.  I'm closing this; if you are still having issues compiling from source, please file a new issue and fill out the template so we can get more information on your issues.
Thanks!
