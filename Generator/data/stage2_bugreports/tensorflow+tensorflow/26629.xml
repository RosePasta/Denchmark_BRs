	<summary>Keras Error: Variable does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable()</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow.keras as ks
def scope_error_test():
    input_holder = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32,
                                  shape=(None, 368, 368, 3),
                                  name='input')
    with tf.variable_scope("scope_1"):
        with tf.variable_scope("scope_2"):
            conv1 = ks.layers.Conv2D(kernel_size=7,
                                     filters=64,
                                     strides=2,
                                     padding='same',
                                     activation=tf.nn.relu,
                                     name='conv1')(input_holder)
            pool1 = ks.layers.MaxPool2D(pool_size=3, padding='same',
                                        strides=2,
                                        name='pool1')(inputs=conv1)
    print(pool1.get_shape().as_list())
with tf.Session() as sess:
        scope_error_test()
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        print(tf.global_variables())
        with tf.variable_scope('', reuse=True):
            for variable in tf.global_variables():
                var_name = variable.name.split(':')[0]
                var_tf = tf.get_variable(var_name)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In this example code, I want to understand why I get this error: ValueError: Variable scope_1/scope_2/conv1/kernel does not exist, or was not created with tf.get_variable(). Did you mean to set reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE in VarScope?
Note: I used tensorflow.contrib.layers instead of tensorflow.keras.layers and It was working correctly! Could be a bug !?
I have tried tensorflow 1.9.0 and tensorflow 1.12.0

 Thanks for your answer. However, it does not work. Did you try it on your machine before write it here ? I have already provide  a minimal working example to help other reproduce the error and try to correct it.

		@Gouiaa All right, the question in this page has no code indent, and I mistook it as a problem I solved the other day. I'm sorry that before I answered on your question page, I didn't read your indented question again.
I'm curious about this problem after read it again. If I work it out on my pycharm, I will write it here.

		Why do you have "with tf.variable_scope('', reuse=True):"?
