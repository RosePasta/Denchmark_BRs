	<summary>ProfilerHook generates wrong timeline traces</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):dockerhub 1.9.0-devel-gpu
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.9.0
Python version:2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source):N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:9.0/7.1
GPU model and memory:Tesla V100 16GB
Exact command to reproduce:
model：https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deep_speech
command:python deep_speech.py --model_dir=./deepSpeech --train_data_dir=./librispeech_data/train-clean-100/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100.csv --eval_data_dir=./librispeech_data/dev-clean/LibriSpeech/dev-clean.csv --num_gpus=-1 --wer_threshold=0.23 --seed=1 --hooks=profilerhook**

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt; The time of the timeline trace  is not correct， which lasts hundreds of years.It's correct at the beginning, and becoming abnormal from the third trace（the 21th step for save_steps=10）.   
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Hi Tatiana -- I'm not sure who owns timelines, but unfortunately that
person is not me.

		I've run into this problem also. Haven't had a chance to dig in yet, but a few more notes about the issue:

In my application, the shift appears to happen on every session.run, but the ops that get shifted are not always consistent.
The amount of the shift appears to be (2^64 / 1000) us, or 2^64 ns. This suggests that the timing values might be stored as 64-bit integers representing timing in nanoseconds. They might be overflowing or the overflow is not being handled correctly.
