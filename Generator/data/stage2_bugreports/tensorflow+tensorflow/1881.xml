	<summary>Update website with correct Cuda info</summary>
	<description>
I received this on twitter:
"Can you please help update TF website to state TF-GPU needs nvidia compute cap. &gt;= 3.5 and to install cudNN v4 (not 5). Thanks"

I'm not using Cuda myself, so I'm not sure of the details here, but wanted to get it logged so somebody more knowledgeable can take a look.

		Thanks Pete!  I twittered that.  I'm new to github community.  Here is a screenshot.

		@alliseesolutions: which documentation was incorrect?  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#optional-install-cuda-gpus-on-linux&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/get_started/os_setup.html#optional-install-cuda-gpus-on-linux&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 appears accurate but we may have stale docs somewhere.

		Oh, our pip install for 0.7.1 was only built for cuda 3.5+, but I believe our installs for 0.8.0+ will probably support 3.0 natively.

		If you build from sources you can use both cudnnv5 and cuda compute 3.0.  We only build pips for the latest official cudnn (v4), and the nightly pip packages now are built with 3.0 support.

		Compiled from source everything worked fine with my Cuda Compute Cap. 3.0 card.

		Also tested that latest 0.8 pip release with cudnn v4 and it works fine with the card as well.  I may suggest adding to the cuda installation instructions that cudnn v4 should be installed if not installing from source.

		I believe our docs &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are currently accurate.
