	<summary>tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter sample code not working in tf 2.1.0</summary>
	<description>
Ubuntu 14
Python 3.5.2
Tensorflow-gpu 'v2.1.0-rc2-17-ge5bf8de'
The sample codes provided on page &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/tensorrt/Converter&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/tensorrt/Converter&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do not work, raise exception:

NameError: name 'DEFAULT_TRT_CONVERSION_PARAMS' is not defined

This fix worked for me:

from tensorflow.python.compiler.tensorrt import trt_convert as trt
params = trt.DEFAULT_TRT_CONVERSION_PARAMS._replace(
precision_mode='FP16')
