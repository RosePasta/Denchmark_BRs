TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):  fails on 1.14.0, 1.15.0rc2, 2.0.0

If a model has sparse input, they seem to be converted to dense tensors when saved_model.save() is called.  This causes model saving to fail.
Describe the expected behavior
If a model works during model.fit(), I expect the same model to also work for saved_model.save().

Thank you for reporting the issue, error also replicating for TF version-&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/oanush/d8dc1f89e88530a4ab3c83cdf81adc15/model-saving-fails-with-sparse-input-tensor.ipynb&gt;2.0rc2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The error is because of the below line of code.
sparse_tensor = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=sparse_tensor.indices, values=sparse_tensor.values, dense_shape=[2, 2]) .
It works fine if you replace that line with below line:
sparse_tensor = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=tf.constant([[0,0],[1,1]], dtype=tf.int64),values=tf.constant([1.0, 1.0], dtype=tf.float32),dense_shape=[2, 2]).

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rmothukuru&gt;@rmothukuru&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I am reproducing this bug specifically: "During tf.saved_model.save(), while calling a model's call() method, all SparseTensor inputs are converted to dense tensors."  That's why the above code fails.
While the suggested one line change fixes the crash on that line, it no longer uses the input to the call() method on that line, and hence no longer reproduce this bug on that line.  I updated the repro colab to simply remove that line, and it'll crash later. See:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/yzhuang/3d4c511b247988fdafbd083785d624c1/model-saving-fails-with-sparse-input-tensor.ipynb&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/gist/yzhuang/3d4c511b247988fdafbd083785d624c1/model-saving-fails-with-sparse-input-tensor.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Let me describe the problem in another way:
focus on the input to the call() method: sparse_tensor.  Its type is a tf.SparseTensor during model.fit(), but its type is a dense Tensor during tf.saved_model.save().

		Could reproduce this bug with TF Version 2.0. Here is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/rmothukuru/807a0c0d20281b818a2abeafeeae7a6b/model-saving-fails-with-sparse-input-tensor.ipynb&gt;Gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Is there a workaround to still save a trained model? My project absolutely needs sparse input tensors, and if I am not able to save them, that will be a major blocker.
Thanks,
