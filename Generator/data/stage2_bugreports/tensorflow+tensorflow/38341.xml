Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version.
please share a simple standalone code to replicate the issue faced.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

Which operators are you talking about?
If you're talking about adding allow_custom_ops=True, could you explain the workflow in the interpreter?
