System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

		TF hasn't offically supported M1 yet. However, you could install TensorFlow from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos&gt;https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The Apple TF on M1 chips is a private fork of TF owned by Apple. We don't have access to fixing code issues there, as per comment in#44751, hence please move this to closed status.

		Although the tensorflow for arm64 is only available at apple's private fork,
I think we need x86_64 package that works on top of the mac's rosetta2 emulation.

		Same issue happened even with using
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-2.3.0-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_14_x86_64.whl
as mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#package-location&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#package-location&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

tensorflow is shown on listing packages using pip list or conda list but you can't import in Python
