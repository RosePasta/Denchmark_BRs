Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): custom-ops container
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): nightly-2.0-preview
Python version: the one with custom-ops container
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the current behavior
As given in this page : &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/eager/custom_layers&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/eager/custom_layers&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I am trying to change the code in seq2seq as follows:
in decoder.py : 
However, while running the pylint stage of sanity_checks it produces the following error:
`tensorflow_addons/seq2seq/decoder_test.py:63: [E1102(not-callable), DecodeRNNTest._testDecodeRNN] my_decoder is not callable
tensorflow_addons/seq2seq/decoder_test.py:140: [E1102(not-callable), DecodeRNNTest._testDynamicDecodeRNNWithTrainingHelperMatchesDynamicRNN] my_decoder is not callable
`
Describe the expected behavior
The E1102 warning should not be raised.

To reproduce, in this pull request: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/145&gt;tensorflow/addons#145&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Go to decoder.py and change the signature of class in line 132
The warning disappear for pylint2 in current pull request, as currently it imports layers from tensorflow.python.keras and then extends layers.Layers
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		This code shows that there is something that pylint is not able to infer but objects from classes inherited from tf.keras.layers.Layer are callable:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;class a(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  pass
class b(a):
  pass
class c(b):
  pass
aobj = a()
bobj = b()
cobj = c()
print(callable(aobj))
print(callable(bobj))
print(callable(cobj))

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

prints True 3 times.
