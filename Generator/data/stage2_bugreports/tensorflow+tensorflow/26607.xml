Hi Sir,
I am trying to run tflite on mobile to classify sound event.
The input of the model is mfcc features from the sound stream, which's type are float32.

It will be throw exception as follow whether I setting the post_training_quantize to True or not
cannot convert between a tensorflowlite tensor with type float32 and a java object of type
