You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
tf.nn.conv2d crashes(Floating_Point_Exception) when any of the first three dimensions of filters.shape(4D) is 0
Describe the expected behavior
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf
tf.nn.conv2d(input=tf.ones((1,1,1,1)), filters=tf.ones((1,1,0,1)), strides=1, padding='SAME')
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
