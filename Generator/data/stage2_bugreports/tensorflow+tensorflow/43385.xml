	<summary>TF 2.3: Learning rate is NOT printed in the training output when using "ReduceLROnPlateau" callback</summary>
	<description>
TensorFlow version: 2.3.0
Python version: 3.8.2
Issue:
Given the TensorFlow version is upgraded to 2.3.0,
Given using "ReduceLROnPlateau" callback,
When perform training on the model with learning rate decay,
Then learning rate "lr - xxx" is NOT printed in the training output
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;reduce_learning_rate = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.9, patience=5)
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=training_epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), callbacks=[reduce_learning_rate])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
