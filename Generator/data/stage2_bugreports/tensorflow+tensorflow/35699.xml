	<summary>Dangling pointer  through IntArrayFromInitializer causing Segfault in Tests</summary>
	<description>
System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 19.10


Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: None


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source


TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1


Python version: 3.6


Bazel version (if compiling from source): 1.2.1


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 9.2.1


CUDA/cuDNN version: None


GPU model and memory: None


Describe the current behavior
The IntArrayFromInitializer routine maintains a reference to the initializer_list's data.
The initializer_list is destroyed at the end of the function's scope as it is not a reference, and there is no guarantee that the initializer_list will exist beyond the function's scope.
This causes Segfaults and Corruption of the memory being referenced as revealed from testing "tensorflow/lite/micro/kernels:elementwise_test". This is illustrated in the screenshot attached below.
Describe the expected behavior
There should be an established certainty that the data being pointed to will be valid beyond the function scope. This can be achieved by using C++ constructs; concrete types instead of the error-prone C-style pointer constructs.
Code to reproduce the issue
test cases available under:
tensorflow/lite/micro/kernels/elementwise_test.cc

		Hello,
This is currently being fixed internally. However, as there are many references of the code (tensorflow/lite/micro/testing/test_utils.h) throughout the tests, we cannot provide an ETA on the fix.
Let us know if this is a blocker for you, otherwise feel free to close the issue.
