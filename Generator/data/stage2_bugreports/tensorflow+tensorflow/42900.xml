	<summary>experimental_steps_per_execution option discarded when loading a model from checkpoint</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Google Colab, TPU
TensorFlow version: 2.3
Python version: 3

Describe the current behavior
I have created and trained a model compiled with the experimental_steps_per_execution option.
When I load the model through tf.keras.models.load_model to resume the training the option experimental_steps_per_execution' is not taken in consideration and keras perform on_step...actions after every step and not after n steps as specified inexperimental_steps_per_execution` when the model was first compiled.
Describe the expected behavior
The model should load the experimental_steps_per_execution' option or there should be an option to specify experimental_steps_per_execution` when loading the model.
If necessary I can modify an MNIST example on Colab, but to reproduce this bug it is just needed to:

create a model
compile it with the experimental_steps_per_execution option enabled
train it for a few epoch to verify the correct behaviour of experimental_steps_per_execution
save the model
load the model through tf.keras.models.load_model
train the model for a few epoch to verify that experimental_steps_per_execution is being disregarded

Other info / logs
One possible workaroud (which I am testing right now) is to set manually the steps per execution with model._configure_steps_per_execution(experimental_steps_per_execution) once it is loaded.
Thank you for your help!

		I think it is in the ignored properties &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L204&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L204&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried in colab with TF nightly version and i am not seeing any issue .Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/2d0207d4eba4b8ce09f8f00ce8462f91/untitled315.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Also, The argument steps_per_execution is no longer experimental. Pass steps_per_execution instead of experimental_steps_per_execution.
Please, verify once and close the issue. Thanks!

		Thank you for your time, everything seems to be working properly in the nightly version, I'm looking forward to the 2.4 release!
