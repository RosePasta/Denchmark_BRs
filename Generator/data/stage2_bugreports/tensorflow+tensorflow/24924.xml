Connection loops occur while Reading TFRecord from S3
note that i've successfully installed aws credential already and have no trouble reading data from S3
( using method from tensorflow.python.lib.io import file_io )
the problem occurs  when i pass my tfrecords S3 Address directly through input_fn to tensorflow.estimator, it takes about 2 hours while do mnist classification training which takes 5 minutes only when same tfrecord from local disc
part of my src are as below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;data_path = s3://mybucket/mydirectory/my.tfrecord
tensorflow.run_train_with_validation(model.train_input_fn,
                                     data_path,
                                     model.vali_input_fn,
                                     steps=steps,
                                     ..........)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

read data from S3 -  logs as below : (over 2H)

 , does this happen if you use the tf.data API as well? &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/TFRecordDataset&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/TFRecordDataset&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
