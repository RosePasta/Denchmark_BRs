Trying out example from Tensorflow Probability with the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import numpy as np

tfd = tfp.distributions
dtype = np.float32

with tf.Session(graph=tf.Graph()) as sess:
  # Set up random seed for the optimizer
  tf.set_random_seed(42)
  true_mean = dtype([0, 0, 0])
  true_cov = dtype([[1, 0.25, 0.25], [0.25, 1, 0.25], [0.25, 0.25, 1]])
  # Loss is defined through the Cholesky decomposition
  chol = tf.linalg.cholesky(true_cov)

  var_1 = tf.Variable(name='var_1', initial_value=[1., 1.])
  var_2 = tf.Variable(name='var_2', initial_value=[1.])

  def loss_fn():
    var = tf.concat([var_1, var_2], axis=-1)
    loss_part = tf.linalg.cholesky_solve(chol, tf.expand_dims(var, -1))
    return tf.linalg.matvec(loss_part, var, transpose_a=True)

  # Set up the learning rate with a polynomial decay
  step = tf.Variable(0, dtype=tf.int64)
  starter_learning_rate = .3
  end_learning_rate = 1e-4
  decay_steps = 1e4
  learning_rate = tf.compat.v1.train.polynomial_decay(
      starter_learning_rate,
      step,
      decay_steps,
      end_learning_rate,
      power=1.)

  # Set up the optimizer
  optimizer_kernel = tfp.optimizer.StochasticGradientLangevinDynamics(
      learning_rate=learning_rate, preconditioner_decay_rate=0.99)
  optimizer_kernel.iterations = step
  optimizer = optimizer_kernel.minimize(loss_fn, var_list=[var_1, var_2])

  # Number of training steps
  training_steps = 5000
  # Record the steps as and treat them as samples
  samples = [np.zeros([training_steps, 2]), np.zeros([training_steps, 1])]
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  for step in range(training_steps):
    sess.run(optimizer)
    sample = [sess.run(var_1), sess.run(var_2)]
    samples[0][step, :] = sample[0]
    samples[1][step, :] = sample[1]

  samples_ = np.concatenate(samples, axis=-1)
  sample_mean = np.mean(samples_, 0)
  print('sample mean', sample_mean)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Getting following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/Users/shashank.gupta/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/optimizer_v2.py", line 318, in minimize
    loss, var_list=var_list, grad_loss=grad_loss)
  File "/Users/shashank.gupta/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/optimizer_v2.py", line 351, in _compute_gradients
    tape.watch(var_list)
  File "/Users/shashank.gupta/miniconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/eager/backprop.py", line 816, in watch
    for t in nest.flatten(tensor):
AttributeError: 'RefVariable' object has no attribute '_id'

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Looks like eager mode is enabled. Have added a command to disable it still it's getting activated.

,
The problem might not be because of Eager Execution because, when I executed the command, , it resulted in . So, the problem might be something else.
Are you just executing One of the Examples of Tensorflow Probability. If so,can you please let us know which example are you trying out from Tensorflow Probability, so that we can dig deeper, and if needed, change the Example as well, accordingly. Thanks!

I am trying an example from here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/optimizer/StochasticGradientLangevinDynamics&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/optimizer/StochasticGradientLangevinDynamics&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Thanks for filing this issue. I was able to reproduce even with . Error is coming from this line in the code.

I am not familiar with . May be it is better to raise an issue in the  repo. Thanks!

 I think this is a stale issue. Please note that there are no upgrades to TF1.x unless there is any security related issue. So, please use TF2.x. I have used  and I was able to run the code without any issue. Also, note that I did  update your code in order to run it in TF2.3. Thanks!
Please take a look at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/3f8a43e8a76d7d3fa66ecf3478891c5a/33407.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Please verify once and close the issue. Thanks !
