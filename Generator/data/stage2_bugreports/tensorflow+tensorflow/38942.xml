	<summary>Impossible to create a simple LSTM layer with tensorflow &amp;gt; 2.1 version</summary>
	<description>
System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Trying to follow these instructions : https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10


Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: No


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary


TensorFlow version (use command below): tested on tf-nightly 2.2.0.dev20200422, tensorflow 2.2.0rc3, tensorflow 2.2.0rc2, tensorflow 2.2.0rc1, tensorflow 2.2.0rc0


Python version: 3.7


Bazel version (if compiling from source):


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):


CUDA/cuDNN version:  10.1


GPU model and memory:


The following instructions is working with tensorflow 2.1 but do not work on tensorflow version &gt; 2.1 in my environment.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import collections
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64))
model.add(layers.LSTM(128))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I get the following error in building LSTM layer:
ValueError: Shape must be at least rank 3 but is rank 2 for '{{node BiasAdd}} = BiasAdd[T=DT_FLOAT, data_format="NCHW"](add, bias)' with input shapes: [?,512], [512].
This is working correctly with tensorflow 2.1 and in google colab: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1evEbvAtAElZqx3cqD4wCPJxC5OUmJeSp&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1evEbvAtAElZqx3cqD4wCPJxC5OUmJeSp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
It seems that tensorflow is using cached parameters (512 might be a batch size used in previous tests...)

I have tried in colab with TF 2.1.0 and 2.2.0-rc3 and i am not seeing any issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/c3b61bdf9c6afbc099162ea820eef91a/untitled832.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ravikyram&gt;@ravikyram&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have found the problem : for an unknown reason, in my environment %USERPROFILE%/.keras/keras.json had "image_data_format": "channels_first"... Changing to "image_data_format": "channels_last" fixed the problem.

		Although the issue was resolved, the bug mentioned here still persists: it is impossible to instantiate a Keras LSTM layer if the data_format was set to channels_first.
Are there plans to fix this regression?
