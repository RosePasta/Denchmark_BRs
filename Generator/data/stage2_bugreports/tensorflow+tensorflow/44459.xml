	<summary>Freeze / crash occurring when batch size is reduced</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 Home 1909
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.1
Python version: 3.7.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1 / cudnn-10.1-windows10-x64-v7.6.5.32
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1660 Ti computeCapability: 7.5, coreClock: 1.455GHz coreCount: 24 deviceMemorySize: 6.00GiB deviceMemoryBandwidth: 268.26GiB/s

Describe the current behavior
When running with large batch sizes in model.fit(), code completes successfully. With smaller batch sizes, the training crashes/freezes in the middle of an epoch.
Describe the expected behavior
Smaller batch sizes do not cause TF to hang or crash.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""Reproduce crash during fit"""
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential


model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(9, activation='relu', input_dim=125))
model.add(Dense(31, activation='softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='adam',
               metrics=['accuracy'])

X_train=np.random.rand(3225, 125)
y_train=np.random.rand(3225, 31)

# This works
model.fit(X_train[:,:], y_train[:,:], 
          epochs=100, 
          batch_size=X_train.shape[0], 
          verbose=1)

# This crashes
model.fit(X_train[:,:], y_train[:,:], 
          epochs=100, 
          batch_size=100, 
          verbose=1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The exact point it freezes seems to vary based on the random seed, here is an example. The shell (cmd.exe) is frozen and must be killed through task manager.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Epoch 11/100
33/33 [==============================] - 1s 18ms/step - loss: 607.7234 - accuracy: 0.0332
Epoch 12/100
24/33 [====================&gt;.........] - ETA: 0s - loss: 645.0050 - accuracy: 0.0288
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I ran the code shared and do not see the issue reported on tf 2.3 or nightly, please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/fc06f34a494a4c162fc3a9527cb53f63/untitled457.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you.

		FYI - I was using Nvidia "Game Ready" drivers (441.22), a newer one (457.09) was released, I upgraded, and I no longer get the crash. Not sure if you test against the "Game Ready" versions but this may have been the cause?

As you as see this is not a bug because of tensorflow and i was able to run your code without any crashing, as the issue is resolved please move this closed status.
