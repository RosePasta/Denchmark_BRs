	<summary>Dataset.from_generator doesn't release memory after recreating the session</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 17.10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.5.0-rc0
Python version: Python 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -
Exact command to reproduce: see below

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After closing the session and creating new one an iterator creates the generator instance but doesn't free the memory of the previous one.
Every calling of the line session.run(x) (see below) increases memory consumption of the script:

519 MiB after the first,
600 MiB after the second,
681 MiB after the third and so on.

As you can see the delta is equal to 80 MiB = N * sizeof(data.dtype). (data.dtype is float64 here)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

N = 10 * 1024 * 1024

def generate():
  data = np.random.rand(N)
  for k in range(N):
    yield data[k].copy()

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
  x = tf.data.Dataset\
    .from_generator(generate, tf.float32)\
    .make_one_shot_iterator()\
    .get_next()

while True:
  session = tf.Session(graph=graph)
  session.run(x) # &lt;--- PUT A BREAKPOINT HERE!
                 #  Be careful running the code without it!
  session.close()

		Of course, if session.run consumes all the elements produced by the generator, it will be removed.

		The fix has been submitted internally, but not yet merged into the Git master branch. It should be coming in the next push!
