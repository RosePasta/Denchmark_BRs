	<summary>TPU usage while running a model using Transfer Learning</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Colab
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Google colab version
TensorFlow version (use command below):2.2.0rc3
Python version:3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source):No
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):No
CUDA/cuDNN version:No
GPU model and memory: TPU

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

**Showing this error while usingTransfer learning and TPU together **
 FailedPreconditionError: Error while reading resource variable efficientnet-b0/stem/conv2d/kernel_31710 from Container: worker. This could mean that the variable was uninitialized. Not found: Resource worker/efficientnet-b0/stem/conv2d/kernel_31710/N10tensorflow3VarE does not exist.
The model should start fitting the data

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

Here it is not able to run an transfer learning models and also Tensoboard callbacks aren't working when using TPU in colab
