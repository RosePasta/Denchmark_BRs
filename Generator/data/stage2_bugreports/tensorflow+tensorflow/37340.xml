Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: - Bazel
version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from
source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
file-based dataset cache increase excessively amount of memory.
Describe the expected behavior
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  dataset = dataset.interleave(filename_to_dataset, cycle_length=num_parallel_calls,
                               num_parallel_calls=num_parallel_reads)

  dataset = dataset.cache("cache")
  dataset = readers._maybe_shuffle_and_repeat(
      dataset, num_epochs, shuffle, shuffle_buffer_size, shuffle_seed)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
