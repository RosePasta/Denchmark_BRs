	<summary>Update Docker description to state CPU requirements</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: n/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (Docker tensorflow/tensorflow)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.10.1 (from core/public/version.h)
Python version:2.7.12
Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: n/a
Exact command to reproduce:
# docker run -it tensorflow/tensorflow bash
root@xxxxxxx:/notebooks# python2.7 -c "import tensorflow as tf"
Illegal instruction

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is a request to update documentation to include minimal system requirements, especially the description for Docker images that include prebuilt binaries.
For example, the main Docker image on DockerHub (tensorflow/tensorflow, 19M downloads) &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/17411&gt;currently does not operate on CPU's without AVX support&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  This includes CPUs sold as recently as 4 years ago.
This requirement should be stated in the Docker image description displayed in DockerHub.  Perhaps also include a link to an alternative docker image that users with non-AVX CPUs may utilize to build from source.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

n/a

		Also, you can indicate the requirement on the docker image:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/#example-manifest-list&gt;https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/#example-manifest-list&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Then users will be notified as soon as trying to pull/execute the image that their platform is insufficient and also the reason why it is.

 Is this still an issue? Thanks!

		Duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/19584&gt;#19584&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
This is a general issue with TensorFlow's official packages, not the Docker images specifically.

		Yes, this is still an issue. Neither
&lt;denchmark-link:https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow&gt;https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 nor
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mention that Tensorflow requires a CPU
with AVX support.
&lt;denchmark-link:#&gt;…&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Why didn't you do it the official way? &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/#example-manifest-list&gt;https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/#example-manifest-list&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
