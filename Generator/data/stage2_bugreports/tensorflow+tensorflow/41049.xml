Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
tf.image.resize(tf.ones([1,416,416,3]),[200,100],tf.image.ResizeMethod.NEAREST_NEIGHBOR, preserve_aspect_ratio=True)
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

I used GPU
I can't meet any bug when I ran GPU kernel tests.

 I am not able to reproduce this in colab. Heres my &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/gowthamkpr/5bff9e1a09be1beebd055ff8b8837d70/untitled293.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can you try using CUDA 10.1 and see if you are running into the same issue. Thanks!

@fsx950223 I am not able to reproduce this in colab. Heres my gist. Can you try using CUDA 10.1 and see if you are running into the same issue. Thanks!

It worked on tf2.2.

 If you see in my gist, its working on 2.3.0rc0 too. Can you please be specific about this issue as I am not running into the issue on Colab.

		I am not able to reproduce the issue. How was tensorflow (that is throwing the error) installed?

I am not able to reproduce the issue. How was tensorflow (that is throwing the error) installed?

I installed tf2.3rc0 in two computers via pip binary, they have same problem.

		I was unable to reproduce either.
Can you please post output of pip list and attach log.txt obtained after running python -vvv -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.image.resize(tf.ones([1,416,416,3]),[200,100],tf.image.ResizeMethod.NEAREST_NEIGHBOR, preserve_aspect_ratio=True))" &amp;&gt; log.txt?
