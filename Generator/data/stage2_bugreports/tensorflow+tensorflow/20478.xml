&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am training a time series using an RNN and my input data has a fixed sequence length per batch.
I am using &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/parse_single_example&gt;parse_single_example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/regressor_parse_example_spec&gt;regressor_parse_example_spec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/feature_column/sequence_numeric_column&gt;sequence_numeric_column&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which parses the features as sparse tensors because &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.8/tensorflow/contrib/feature_column/python/feature_column/sequence_feature_column.py#L419&gt;_parse_example_spec returns VarLenFeature&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I want to parse our data as dense tensors because the underlying data is dense, and using sparse tensors in our graph requires extra unnecessary complexity for our calculations. I want to continue to use feature_columns to describe our data and sequence_input_layer but I propose adding a new feature column type sequence_fixed_len_numeric_column that parses as a dense tensor.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/jperl/245c414793a5271da72183bada93c55c#file-sequence_fixed_len_numeric_column-py-L35&gt;Here is the implementation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I would be happy to submit a PR + add tests. But first I wanted to confirm this a idiomatic approach.
Alternatively I could add a parameter to sequence_numeric_column, is_fixed to accomplish the same things.

		does adding dense_shape as an argument to sequence_numeric_column make sense?

 I like that.
Right now shape has a default value of (1, ). So how should the behavior work? If you define both, it will prefer dense_shape?
I'll put a PR together w/ tests this week.

		Having another thought. we can do following without a parameter:
in _get_sequence_dense_tensor:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if input is sparse tensor:
  call sparse to dense
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This will handle the dense input case but not the parsing spec. if user uses the parsing spec of feature column then they should not be aware of whether this is sparse or not. It should work for them.
does it make sense?

		Ok I agree parsing spec should be handled separately. I put together a PR here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/20860&gt;#20860&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I will add unit tests but first want to make sure that is aligned with how you are thinking about it?
Also should I move  into  since that is where &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/feature_column/feature_column.py#L3375-L3387&gt;_sequence_length_from_sparse_tensor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is located? Or keep it in this file?

		Closing. We switched away from feature columns.

		Is there any reason that sequence_numeric_column only supports value as SparseTensor? I think sequence_numeric_columns has to accept dense tensor by default.
