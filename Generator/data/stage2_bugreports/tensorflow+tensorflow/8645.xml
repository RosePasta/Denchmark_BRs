		I am not sure it's a bug in TensorFlow. I think you're trying to restore from a checkpoing from different models. Do you have a simpler repro? Without django? (It could be concurrent access to the web server?)

		I'm sure the models  are the same .Otherwise the front  several times would not work . I send the repro to your email. Thanks~

, we cannot generally give help over private channels. You should make a reproducible example that can be posted publicly, please. That way other people than &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/drpngx&gt;@drpngx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can help.
