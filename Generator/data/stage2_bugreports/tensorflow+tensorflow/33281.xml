		I think I was to handle exceptions in such way some time ago, unfortunately, I can not anymore find a working solution neither for 1.x neither for 2.0

		Your decode_jpeg_and_label Python function is only executed once to build the function graph and try and except statements will have no effect at that.
The actual execution of the logic happens when next is called (as part of for elem in dataset:), so if you would like to catch the error you could do the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;dataset = ...
iterator = iter(dataset)

while True:
  try:
    elem = next(iterator)
    ...
  except InvalidArgumentError:
    ...
  except StopIteration:
    break
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Thank you for explanation. The only difference, seems like we need to catch  on the last next call

		You are right, I updated my response above to reflect that.
