Python:2.7
tensorflow:1.9
python script
input_arrays= ["Mul"] output_arrays=["final_result"] converter = tf.contrib.lite.TocoConverter.from_frozen_graph(graph_def_file,input_arrays,output_arrays) tflite_model = converter.convert() open("model.tflite", "wb").write(tflite_model)
It was working fine a month before.Now it shows the following error
File "/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/lite/python/convert_saved_model.py", line 205, in get_tensors_from_tensor_names
",".join(invalid_tensors)))
ValueError: Invalid tensors 'Mul' were found.

 You mentioned it was working well a month before. What was the change you made recently? Did you upgrade tensorflow or python or any other dependencies?Could you provide a code to reproduce bug? Could you try it in Google &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com&gt;colab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to verify whether it is working or not. Can you also try to upgrade your code to latest TF. Thanks!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jvishnuvardhan&gt;@jvishnuvardhan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 It was working fine... When I use the same input and output tensor names for the tflite conversion i got the error... Then I changed the tensor names to
input array = "lambda_1/Mul"
output array = "model_2/model_1/dense_2/Softmax"
It works with above names... I wonder why...?

 Could you check with TF1.13.1 and see whether the bug persists with latest version. You could also try TF2.0. Thanks!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jvishnuvardhan&gt;@jvishnuvardhan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 It is working for python 3.5( Mul,final_result) But for Python 2.7 there remains the bug
