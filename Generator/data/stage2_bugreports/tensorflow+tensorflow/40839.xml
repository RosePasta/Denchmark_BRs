 attached a sample BMP file

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (pip)
TensorFlow version: 2.2.0
Python version: 3.7.7

Describe the current behavior
When reading in a 4-channel BMP:

tf.io.decode_image(img, channels=3) gives shape (..., ..., 4) instead of (..., ..., 3)
tf.io.decode_bmp(img, channels=3) gives the following error

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "channels.py", line 44, in &lt;module&gt;
    loop()
  File "channels.py", line 14, in loop
    img = tf.io.decode_bmp(img, channels=3)
  File "C:\Users\mattchee\Miniconda3\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\ops\gen_image_ops.py", line 899, in decode_bmp
    _ops.raise_from_not_ok_status(e, name)
  File "C:\Users\mattchee\Miniconda3\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\framework\ops.py", line 6653, in raise_from_not_ok_status     
    six.raise_from(core._status_to_exception(e.code, message), None)
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 3, in raise_from
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: channels attribute 3 does not match bits per pixel from file 4 [Op:DecodeBmp]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm following &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images#load_using_tfdata&gt;this guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to load images efficiently so  is not an option.
Describe the expected behavior
This is inconsistent with tf.io.decode_image(img, channels=3) and tf.io.decode_png(img, channels=3) which give shape (..., ..., 3) when reading a 4-channel PNG.
Both tf.io.decode_image(img, channels=3) and tf.io.decode_bmp(img, channels=3) would be expected to give shape (..., ..., 3) when reading in a 4-channel BMP.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
img = tf.io.read_file(img_path)
img = tf.io.decode_image(img, channels=3)
print(img.shape) # This prints (64, 127, 4)
Or
img = tf.io.read_file(img_path)
img = tf.io.decode_bmp(img, channels=3) # Error
print(img.shape)

 Can you share a sample bmp file to reproduce the issue?

		Can you also test with tf-nightly. There has been a refactoring of tf.io.decode_image recently which I think covers this issue too.

		Thank you for reporting the issue. It appears to be an inherent issue with decode_bmp op. I will look into it and loop back with updates. In the meantime, it would be helpful if you could please share the bmp file for reproducing the issue.

  I've added a sample BMP file to the issue description.

 I've tried with  and got the same problem as described above.

		I've tried it with tf-nightly 2.4.0-dev20200708 and it's all good.
Thank you very much for fixing the issue!
