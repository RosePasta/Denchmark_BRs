	<summary>tf.io.gfile.listdir does not with with S3 buckets</summary>
	<description>
System information - MacOS, Tensorflow 2.1, Python 3.7.6
Describe the current behavior
Executing tf.io.gfile.listdir("s3://bucket-name/") results in:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/private/var/folders/bn/36k9myl51_v23yyxm629ly4w0000gn/T/tmp.PygT1otw/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/lib/io/file_io.py in list_directory_v2(path)
    644   return [
    645       compat.as_str_any(filename)
--&gt; 646       for filename in pywrap_tensorflow.GetChildren(compat.as_bytes(path))
    647   ]
    648

InvalidArgumentError: S3 path doesn't contain an object name: s3://bucket-name/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
It should return a list of objects within the bucket.
S3 is quite limited in features for searching/globbing S3 objects but simple operations like listing objects under a given key (in the case above, /), are well supported and it would be good to include in Tensorflow.
The error message is also somewhat confusing.

Could you please share simple stand alone code to reproduce the issue in our environment. It helps in localizing the issue faster. Thanks!

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ravikyram&gt;@ravikyram&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , so I provided it in the description:  is the sample code.
You obviously need a S3 bucket set up. I can provide this privately if required, but I expect you have the ability to create one yourselves.
For reference executing tf.io.gfile.stat("s3://bucket-name/key") works fine, but anything involving listing or globbing fails with the exception listed in the description.

		The same stuff. Have to use s3://bucket/data instead of just s3://bucket/ to store files and for globing to work.

Is this still an issue.

		I think this will get fixed in the 2.4 final release, after &lt;denchmark-link:https://cs.opensource.google/tensorflow/tensorflow/+/master:tensorflow/core/platform/file_system_helper.cc;l=123-266;drc=8b5b9dc96666a3a5d27fad7179ff215e3b74b67c&gt;rewriting implementation of matching code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
