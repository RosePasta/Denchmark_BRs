	<summary>The docs are unscrollable with JavaScript disabled</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/stack&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/stack&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

body[pending] {
	overflow: hidden;
}
should be removed.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

JS is considered harmful, so the docs should be usable without JS.
The same problem is present in Android and Fuchsia docs.

		Thanks for the report.
We currently push old versions to GitHub and these are plain Markdown files: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r1.10/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/stack.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r1.10/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/stack.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But we will also start pushing the the current version as part of the standard release. Good point.

		Thanks for the workaround, but I think that the websites should be fixed too.

		I've filed an internal ticket: b/136665885
Can't promise anything and JavaScript will remain on the siteâ€”but maybe we can at least get it to scroll without it :)

		Alright ... scrolling without JavaScript should be fixed in prod now.
I don't have a way to test but let me know if you run into an issue. Thanks
