	<summary>tf.summary.FileWriter doesn't support unicode paths.</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):

Yes. In fact, I use code from Denny Britz's CNN tutorial:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf&gt;https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Line 116, (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf/blob/master/train.py&gt;https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf/blob/master/train.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):

Windows 10, x86_64, locale: Russian


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
binary, pip install tensorflow


TensorFlow version (use command below):
b'unknown' 1.2.0


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
n/a


CUDA/cuDNN version:
8.0, 5.1


GPU model and memory:
nvidia 970


Exact command to reproduce:


&lt;denchmark-code&gt;out_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.curdir, "runs", timestamp))
train_summary_dir = os.path.join(out_dir, "summaries", "train")
train_summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(train_summary_dir, sess.graph, flush_secs=5)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The running directory is:
C:\Users\Locky\Google Диск\MachineLearning\wildml-cnn-nlp\cnn-text-classification-tf 
But FileWriter writes summaries to
C:\Users\Locky\Google Р”РёСЃРє\MachineLearning\wildml-cnn-nlp\cnn-text-classification-tf 
"Р”РёСЃРє" doesn't make sense in Russian, and perhaps, comes from:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\summary\writer\event_file_writer.py", line 70, in __init__
    compat.as_bytes(os.path.join(self._logdir, "events")))

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I suspect that 'as_bytes' corrupts the string with Russian characters. Therefore, I think, this behaviour is a bug.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;```
# Output directory for models and summaries
    timestamp = str(int(time.time()))
    out_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.curdir, "runs", timestamp))
    print("Writing to {}\n".format(out_dir))
   
    # Summaries for loss and accuracy
    loss_summary = tf.summary.scalar("loss", cnn.loss)
    acc_summary = tf.summary.scalar("accuracy", cnn.accuracy)

    # Train Summaries
    train_summary_op = tf.summary.merge([loss_summary, acc_summary, grad_summaries_merged])
    train_summary_dir = os.path.join(out_dir, "summaries", "train")
    train_summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(train_summary_dir, sess.graph, flush_secs=5)

    # Dev summaries
    dev_summary_op = tf.summary.merge([loss_summary, acc_summary])
    dev_summary_dir = os.path.join(out_dir, "summaries", "dev")
    dev_summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(dev_summary_dir, sess.graph)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I'm not a SWIG expert but seems like something odd is going on when the bytes are passed from the python code into C++.

 I don't have a windows dev machine at the moment. However, the non-ASCII path for Windows could also be impacted by the sys default encoding. Can you use  to see the output if possible?
