	<summary>slim doesn't play well with the new tf.layers v 1.0</summary>
	<description>
We use tf.contrib.slim to build NN architecture. After upgrade to tensorflow 1.0 the are some trouble when building models with slim. For example slim.arg_scope doesn't work with the tf.layers components. And when we keep using slim.* layers, we got a runtime error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Session was not created with a graph before Run()!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we use all the layers from tf.layers this runtime error goes away.
Any ideas ?

		slim is kind of out of maintenance in my opinion. The better option is to migrate to new tf.layers or use another higher level abstraction based on TensorFlow.

		You can still use all layers and slim.arg_scope with tf.contrib.layers but not with tf.layers. Slim layers, losses, and metrics have been merged into tf.contrib.layers, tf.contrib.losses, tf.contrib.metrics.
