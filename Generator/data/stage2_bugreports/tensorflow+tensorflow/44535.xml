	<description>
tfp.stats.histogram does not print out that it has no gradients.  I would expect there would be a message indicating gradients aren't flowing like when you use tf.round().
Verified no gradients via
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = tf.Variable([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tmp = tfp.stats.histogram(x, [0,10])
grad = tape.gradient(tmp, x)
grad is None
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

,
On running the code with TF v2.3 and TF-nightly,  returns . Please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/2dcf867b0e18a620d001b6c3b0f5c179/44535.ipynb#scrollTo=gzgSd3M5szzo&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

   Yes that is what i also see.  When you do the same thing with tf.round, it prints a warning saying that none of the gradients are flowing down to earlier layers. I would think histogram should do the same thing.

		This seems to be the wrong repository for this bug - could you file it in TFP? (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/issues&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/issues&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
