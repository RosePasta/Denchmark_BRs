Getting gradients without error
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
inputs = np.array([[[x + y * 10 for x in [1,2]] for y in range(5)]])
inputs = inputs.reshape((1,1,inputs.shape[1],inputs.shape[2]))
print("inputs:", inputs)
import tensorflow as tf
tf.reset_default_graph()
with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
x = tf.placeholder("float", [1, 1, None, 2])
y = tf.extract_image_patches(images=x, ksizes=[1, 1, 3, 1], strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], rates=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID')
gradient = tf.gradients(y, x)
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
with tf.Session(graph=g) as sess:
sess.run(init)
print(sess.run([y], feed_dict = {x:inputs}))
Other info / logs

		I have tried on colab with TF version 1.12 &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a1lDY5ZsPsHI3ZRk3ePWO3lP_r-k2Y2D&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,1.13,1.14,nightly versions &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B-1ObJLXLNpuOA_Tx_WUtwkq15oiqTMt&gt;gist &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
and was able to reproduce the issue.However in Nightly version it is throwing different error ```
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: Fetch argument &lt;tf.Operation 'init' type=NoOp&gt; cannot be interpreted as a Tensor. (Operation name: "init"
op: "NoOp"
 is not an element of this graph
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 I cannot reproduce the error if you remove init op. Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/179569689d746cc40770799bb952024f/tf_31367.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		Thanks probably because you are using the nightly build. With my version it happens regardless the init op. I think that the root cause for this is the following issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/11651&gt;#11651&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which have been fixed recently, but not released

 You could use  for now and in the next couple of months new stable version will be released. I am closing the issue for now. Please feel free to open the issue if it persists with the new version. Thanks!
