There are two issues here:
1: tf.nn.conv2d does not support float64 tensors on CPU although the documentation states it should
2: after the first occurrence of the situation above, tf.nn.conv2d keeps crashing with the same error even when we provide float32 tensors.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System: Linux
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN: None
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
-&gt; https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
(not 100% sure though)
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
-&gt; 0.11.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# issue 1: this never works although the documentation states that it should
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

input = tf.constant(np.zeros([1,5,5,1]))
filter = tf.constant(np.zeros([3,3,1,1]))
op = tf.nn.conv2d(input, filter, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID')
tf.Session().run(op)

# issue 2: 
# - this works if executed *before* the part above
# - this does not work if exectuted *after* the part above
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

input2 = tf.constant(np.zeros([1,5,5,1]), dtype=np.float32)
filter2 = tf.constant(np.zeros([3,3,1,1]), dtype=np.float32)
op2 = tf.nn.conv2d(input2, filter2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID')
tf.Session().run(op2)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Our doc is incorrect in this case: we currently don't support 64-bit conv2d. We will have the doc updated shortly. Thanks.
We do have plans to support 64-bit in the near future.

 Is a near term doc update likely?
