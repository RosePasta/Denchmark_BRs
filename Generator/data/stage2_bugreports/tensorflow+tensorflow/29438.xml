	<summary>TimeDistributed wrapper around DepthwiseConv2D broken (AttributeError) in 1.13</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Linux Ubuntu 18.04:
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from pip3:
TensorFlow version b'v1.13.1-0-g6612da8951' 1.13.1
Python version:
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0.130 / 7.4.1
GPU model and memory: NVIDIA K80; 11GB

Describe the current behavior
TimeDistributed wrapper around DepthwiseConv2D fails with AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'dims'
Describe the expected behavior
Wrapper should succesfully apply to layer; previously worked in TF 1.11.0.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, DepthwiseConv2D, TimeDistributed

test_td_input = Input(shape=(None, 1, 128, 8))
TimeDistributed(DepthwiseConv2D(depth_multiplier=1,
                                      kernel_size=(1, 4), strides=(1, 1)))(test_td_input)


**Other info / logs**

		I am able to reproduce the issue with tf 1.13.1 on colab. Thanks!

		Thanks for reporting this.
Roughly looking through stack trace, I think the issue is that TimeDistributed layer does not wrap input shape as TensorShape before calling Conv2D.build
I will see if I can fix it

		Sorry I meant DepthWiseConv2D

		Fixed and should be available in tf nightly. Let me know if it doesn't work for you.
