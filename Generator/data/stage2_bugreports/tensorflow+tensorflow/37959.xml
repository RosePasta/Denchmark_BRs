Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow): na
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04): colab/ubuntu
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below): pip
Python version: - Bazel
version (if compiling from source):1.4.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from
source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
Error raised once "import tensorflow as tf"
from tensorflow.python.keras.saving.saved_model import load_from_saved_model
ImportError: cannot import name 'load_from_saved_model'
It seems like it happens today, which "import tensorflow" will raise this error once I "pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0".
Describe the expected behavior
Try to run "from tensorflow.python.keras.saving.saved_model import load_from_saved_model
"
It should import correctly without any error.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full

 I was able to import tensorflow using tensorflow 1.15. Can you please install tensorflow -gpu 1.15. Also check if any other versions of tensorflow exists. Thanks!

		Close ticket.
It is because my origiinal TF2.0 is not removed cleanly.
