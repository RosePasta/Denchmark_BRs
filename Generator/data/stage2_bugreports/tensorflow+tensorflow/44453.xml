&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"


When I was training resnet50 model with some epochs,especially when the classification is reaching below 0.09, the following error appears.

The resource for tf is on HPC, I have no right to update to 2.x. Also what's the meaning of "1.x is not supported", thxs!
