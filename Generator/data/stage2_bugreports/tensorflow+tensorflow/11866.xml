The docs &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/image/working_with_bounding_boxes&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  for bounding boxes  have an error :
The paragraph reading
For example, if an image is 100 x 200 pixels and the bounding box is [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9], the bottom-left and upper-right coordinates of the bounding box will be (10, 40) to (50, 180).
would better go something like:
For example, if an image is 100 x 200 pixels and the bounding box is [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9], the upper-left and bottom-right coordinates of the bounding box will be (10, 40) to (50, 180), using a somewhat idiosyncratic (y,x) notation, or (40,10) to (180,50) using the rather more common (x,y) notation for points in a plane.  All this is with 'usual' coordinate axes (origin in the top left corner, increasing x to right and increasing y going down)

		Is it really  ? Yes as said on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/image/working_with_bounding_boxes&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/image/working_with_bounding_boxes&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The coordinates of the each bounding box in boxes are encoded as [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max].

You could create a PR for around line 700 in
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/image_ops.cc#L700&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/image_ops.cc#L700&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I agree It is not intuitive but it's mentioned as swapped.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Wouldn't it be better to mention width and height to trigger the users?

For example, if an image is 100 height x 200 width pixels

or

For example, if an image is 100 x 200 (height  x width) pixels

		I tried doing a pr &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/11889&gt;11889&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as you suggested, thanks.
