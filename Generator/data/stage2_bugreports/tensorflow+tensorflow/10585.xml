&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Because the buffers holding the model weight values are 77MB in size, the memory needed to load these into the app can crash in Android, even before the model is run. So I want to run convert_graphdef_memmapped_format to map them into memory.So I build it.When I run it ,it get me a errortensorflow/contrib/util/convert_graphdef_memmapped_format.cc:61] Unknown argument –-in_graph=/Users/liba/Desktop/OptimizeCTNModel.pb 
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

log:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ZHANGSH7-MP:tensorflow liba$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/util/convert_graphdef_memmapped_format –-in_graph=/Users/liba/Desktop/OptimizeCTNModel.pb –-out_graph=/Users/liba/Desktop/MemmappedCTNModel.pb

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Can you take a look?  The error does seem inconsistent with the usage information it spits out.
