	<summary>PyCharm debugger automatically evaluates Tensor._shape and spams console</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution: macOS 10.14.6
TensorFlow version: 1.14.0
Python version: 3.6.8

Describe the current behavior
When analyzing a tensor in eager-execution mode in the "Watches" of the PyCharm Debugger, the deprecated object Tensor._shape is automatically evaluated. This results in following warning in the console (two times for one evaluation). When evaluating many tensor, this substantially spams the console.
W0801 15:29:42.581780 4505736640 ops.py:465] Tensor._shape is private, use Tensor.shape instead. Tensor._shape will eventually be removed.
Describe the expected behavior
Significant reduce in the amount of warnings, ideally to zero.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

import numpy as np

tensor_1 = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.ones((20, 20)))

print()  # set breakpoint here

 ,
Can you please try using different Python IDE and let us know your feedback.Thanks!

		Hi @anush-o,
I think the problem emerges when a debugger of any IDE automatically evaluates all attributes of a tensor, including the private ones. So I am not sure what reproducing the problem in another IDE would accomplish.
There might be two ways to move forward:
(1) Remove either the warning or the deprecated attribute as the disadvantages outweigh the advantages for some users of one of the most popular IDEs.
(2) Somehow manage that the warning is not printed excessively.

 Did you try this
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3' 
import tensorflow as tf

#0 = all messages are logged (default behavior)
#1 = INFO messages are not printed
#2 = INFO and WARNING messages are not printed
#3 = INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages are not printed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This issue will also get fixed as we move to TF2.1 release, when we can remove the old deprecation messages

Yes, but I do not want to turn off warnings during debugging, because those can be helpful.

 Could you please confirm if the issue persist, i have tried this on anaconda and colab there is no issue.

 I am running 2.1 and I am still getting the warning with logs off.
