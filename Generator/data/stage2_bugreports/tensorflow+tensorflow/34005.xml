 Do you want to work on improving this section? I could not understand from the opened issue if you have only reported an issue or also proposed to work with it? In later case, I can join you in re-formatting the doc for this topic.

 Sure, I would like to work on it. But I will have to look into its technical details before that. If you have any resources, it would be great if you share them. I'll try to learn something about it from code in the meanwhile.

 I had started working on the formatting part of the issue and was planning to make a PR till tomorrow. The job is mostly to

Sync the docs formatting with its r1 version.
Make the documentation easier to understand, editing it and adding "Examples:" and "Raises:" sections.
I can make some minor edits with the language to make it more suitable as a Google Code-In challenge.
@ymodak , @dubesar ?
