I am trying to reverse my inputs with array_ops.reverse_sequence() before sending it to dynamic_rnn(), the inference graph can be build with no problem, but when building the training graph, I got the following error:
  Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not NoneType


The problem appears to arise when input_shape.ndims is None (which is a valid possibility).

		For some reasons I am not allowed to post my code here, but the bug occurs when I try to stack multiple layers of BLSTM using dynamic_rnn() (see this related request: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1779&gt;#1779&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). For the backward pass, I first reversed the input using array_ops.reverse_sequence(), then reversed the output using the same function. I also used feed forward layers in between the BLSTMs.
However, with one BLSTM layer, everything is fine.
Thanks for all the help!

		I'm not certain that fixing this issue will solve &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1779&gt;#1779&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but I have a simple fix to this issue in review so hopefully you'll be able to check soon!
