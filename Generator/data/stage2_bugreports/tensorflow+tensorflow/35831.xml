	<summary>Building the PoseNet example on iOS is failed</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution: macOS 10.15 and iPadOS 13.3
Mobile device: iPad 2018
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pod

Describe the problem
I did all the steps from the readme of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/ios&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/ios&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but got next error:

[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "TensorFlowLiteSwift":
In snapshot (Podfile.lock):
TensorFlowLiteSwift (= 0.0.1-nightly)


In Podfile:
TensorFlowLiteSwift (= 0.0.1-nightly)


None of your spec sources contain a spec satisfying the dependencies: TensorFlowLiteSwift (= 0.0.1-nightly), TensorFlowLiteSwift (= 0.0.1-nightly).


You have either:

out-of-date source repos which you can update with pod repo update or with pod install --repo-update.
mistyped the name or version.
not added the source repo that hosts the Podspec to your Podfile.


The solution
To make it work I just removed the Podfile.lock file and run again the command
pod install
Maybe the source repo should also be updated.
Thanks!
P.S.: Initially it was posted there &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35803&gt;#35803&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 please post tflite issues &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/&gt;tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 repo.

 this is not related to tfjs, as the link above points to tflite examples.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AnyCPU&gt;@AnyCPU&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, though we can avoid this error by removing , &lt;denchmark-link:https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#benefits-of-ignoring-the-pods-directory&gt;it should not be removed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Whether or not you check in the Pods directory,
the Podfile and Podfile.lock should always be kept under version control.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Did you run pod repo update?
What version of cocoapod did you use? You can find it with pod --version.
I used cocoapod version 1.7.5, and failed to reproduce the error.

cocoa pods version is 1.8.4
The pod repo update helped.
It is pretty strange I had trouble running it, anyway it works well now.
Thanks!
