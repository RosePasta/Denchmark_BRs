	<summary>Improving Google Indexing for the Documentation</summary>
	<description>
Whenever I run a Google search on a TensorFlow functionality, say, tf.reshape, it gives me the entire documentation, not the specific documentation related to that functionality.
Currently the way I use is  to run a search with ctrl + f to find specific documentation related to what I search for.
Numpy has that property, i.e. when you run a Google search on np.reshape, you get the specific page.
It would be a nice improvement for the documentation if someone fixes the Google indexing for the documentation page, especially for the users who frequently use Google search for the documentation.

 Is this something that might be addressed by the upcoming changes to documentation?

		(With delayed move to new docs) it did help
When I search for tf.reshape, the first result I get is to tensorflow documentation in the new TF website.
