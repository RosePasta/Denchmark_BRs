	<summary>Keras Model in SavedModel format Errors on Loading -ValueError('Model inputs are already set.')</summary>
	<description>
System information
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): ProductName:	Mac OS X, ProductVersion:	10.15.2, BuildVersion:	19C57
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0
Python version: 3.6.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: None
GPU model and memory: None
Describe the current behavior
When trying to load one of my SavedModel format models (saved using 1.15.0) usingtf.keras.models.load_modelan error is thrown at the following location:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/Users/saurabh/.pyenv/versions/emotion-python/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/engine/training.py", line 2671, in _set_input_attrs
    raise ValueError('Model inputs are already set.')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I can successfully load and run this model using TensorFlow versions 2.0.0, 1.15.0 and 1.14.0.
Describe the expected behavior
Can successfully load a model from a SMB(SavedModel format) file.
Code to reproduce the issue:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf

model_smb = tf.keras.models.load_model('smbnew', compile=False)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs:
_I am also attaching a dummy SavedModel model below which can be used to test.
Complete Stacktrace of the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;

    raise ValueError('Model inputs are already set.')
ValueError: Model inputs are already set.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When loaded with tf.keras in v2.0.0 the layers, model config, inputs, outputs, summary etc. are all parsed correctly, as well as being able to run data through the model.

		Was able to replicate the issue with Tf 2.1.
Please find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/gadagashwini/f90b3abd21f828db1212f4dab2a1c5d7/untitled512.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I think this was resolved in recent . Please take a look at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/75bb1d6f47dace0e45c272dfb5428ff0/untitled512.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If you want to use a stable version,  will be released in near future and this update will reflect in .
Please verify once and close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!

 I don't think so. But I guess  may be released soon as the last release candidate (rc3) was a week back. Thanks!

		I am closing the issue as this was resolved. I think stable TF2.2 will be released in near future. Please feel free to reopen if it persists again later. Thanks!
