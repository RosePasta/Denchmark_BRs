	<summary>Unable to use canned RNN Estimator</summary>

Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): not really (very close to stock example here)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Version 10.14.5
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip (from binary?)
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.14.0-rc1-22-gaf24dc91b5 1.14.0
Python version: 3.6.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
 when using &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/RNNEstimator&gt;RNNEstimator&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Describe the expected behavior
No errors when used correctly (maybe that is the issue).
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf

sequence_feature_colums = [tf.contrib.feature_column.sequence_numeric_column("test")]

estimator = tf.contrib.estimator.RNNEstimator(
    head=tf.contrib.estimator.regression_head(),
    sequence_feature_columns=sequence_feature_colums)

def input_fn_train():
  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(({"test": [0]}, [0]))
  dataset = dataset.batch(1)
  return dataset

estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn_train, steps=1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Also, just FYI, contrib is going away in tf 2.0, and we are not actively fixing anything in contrib.

		The input tensor needs to be a sparse tensor, and you need to specify the
number of cells. The following code should work:
```

sequence_feature_colums =
[tf.contrib.feature_column.sequence_numeric_column("test")]

estimator = tf.contrib.estimator.RNNEstimator(
num_units=[3],
head=tf.contrib.estimator.regression_head(),
sequence_feature_columns=sequence_feature_colums)

def input_fn_train():
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((
{"test": tf.SparseTensorValue([[0, 0]], [0.], (1, 1))},
[0]))
dataset = dataset.batch(1)
return dataset

estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn_train, steps=1)
```
