	<summary>Documentation update: virtualenv should not be run from ~</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
The documentation suggests that you make a virtualenv essentially by “cd ~; mkdir tensorflow; virtualenv ~/tensorflow”. Unfortunately, for some reason I cannot comprehend, this makes virtualenv try to scan every HTML file (possibly also others) in ~; in my case, this hit a 22 MB file I had lying around, causing virtualenv to use 5+ minutes (I eventually aborted it) and 4.5 GB of RAM without really saying why.
A better workaround is “cd ~; mkdir tensorflow; cd tensorflow; virtualenv .”, since seemingly the scanning is of the current directory. The documentation should probably be updated.

		Is it possible that you had . in your $PATH or $path (in csh)? That's not advised for security reasons, and it might confuse virtualenv which is using your system versions of software (which is probably found by using $PATH).
