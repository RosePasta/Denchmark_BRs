	<summary>random_uniform for int32 broken on GPU</summary>
	<description>
tf.random_uniform with dtype=tf.int32 always produces 106199773 on GPU.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [3]: with tf.device('/cpu'): print(tf.random_uniform([], 0, 10, dtype=tf.int32).eval())
6

In [4]: with tf.device('/gpu'): print(tf.random_uniform([], 0, 10, dtype=tf.int32).eval())
1061997773
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment:
CentOS 7
TensorFlow 0.9.0

		This is likely caused by conversion between float and int.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [15]: tf.cast(0.0, 'int32').eval()
Out[15]: 1056964608
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		That does seem like a bug, but it will be hard for us to reproduce since we don't have CentOS machines, and it doesn't seem to happen on what we do have.  Would you be up for investigating further?

		Yes, I would like to.

		Have you had a chance to do any more experiments, to try to isolate the problem?

		A system reboot seems to fix the problem, for a few days. I will make more investigation the next time I have a chance.
