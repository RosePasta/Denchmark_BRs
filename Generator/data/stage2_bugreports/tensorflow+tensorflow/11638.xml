	<summary>Probably wrong implementation for tf.layers.max_pooling1d when data_format='channels_first'</summary>
	<description>
In function call of class _Pooling1D,  when the input data_format='channels_first', it should transform input tensor from 'N,C,H' to 'N,C,H,W' (batch_size, channels, height, width), meaning that we should expand dimension on the last dimension.
However, in the code we use inputs = array_ops.expand_dims(inputs, 1), expanding on the second dimension and transforming from 'N,C,H' to 'N,1,C,H'. Then the pool_shape and strides are looking at the third dimension, which is not consistant with our expand_dims(inputs, 1) used before.
I think the code should be changed to inputs = array_ops.expand_dims(inputs, -1) and return array_ops.squeeze(outputs, -1). Using -1 will expand and squeeze on the last dimension, transforming from 'N,C,H' to **'N,C,H,1', and then doing pool_shape and strides on the third dimension.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source Code&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  def call(self, inputs):
    # There is no TF op for 1D pooling, hence we make the inputs 4D.
    if self.data_format == 'channels_last':
      inputs = array_ops.expand_dims(inputs, 2)
      pool_shape = (1,) + self.pool_size + (1, 1)
      strides = (1,) + self.strides + (1, 1)
      data_format = 'NHWC'
    else:
      inputs = array_ops.expand_dims(inputs, 1)
      pool_shape = (1, 1) + self.pool_size + (1,)
      strides = (1, 1) + self.strides + (1,)
      data_format = 'NCHW'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Indeed, looks not right to me. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fchollet&gt;@fchollet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I agree with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZekunZh&gt;@ZekunZh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The  in  should transform:

NHC to NHWC  for channels_last with expand_dims(inputs, 2)
NCH to NCHW for channels_first with expand_dims(inputs, -1) not 1

		Thanks for your invitation ! &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/taehoonlee&gt;@taehoonlee&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have proposed my solution in my first post. To be clearer, my suggestion of code for  function of  class :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  def call(self, inputs):
    # There is no TF op for 1D pooling, hence we make the inputs 4D.
    if self.data_format == 'channels_last':
      ...
    else:
      inputs = array_ops.expand_dims(inputs, -1)
      pool_shape = (1, 1) + self.pool_size + (1,)
      strides = (1, 1) + self.strides + (1,)
      data_format = 'NCHW'

    outputs = ...

    if self.data_format == 'channels_last':
      ...
    else:
      return array_ops.squeeze(outputs, -1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I will make my pull request very soon.

		The issue is already fixed (refer to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/layers/pooling.py#L74&gt;codes&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
