	<summary>Documentation For The New Version of Histogram on TensorBoard</summary>
	<description>
Hello~
I'm trying to interpret the new version of the histogram and it looks like the x-axis represents the value/bin, y-axis represent the step/time, and z-axis represents the density since it is a continuous number. In addition, the color represents the standard deviation??
Is my interpretation correct? If so, I can help putting up the documentation for the new histogram tab.
Thanks!

		Thanks @TalhuaLI. FYI, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/danmane&gt;@danmane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I assume documentation contributions are welcome.

		Yes, documentation contributions would be welcome. As you hypothesize, the axes are bin value, time in steps, and density. The color is actually just a function of which run it is from, and how far back in time it is.
I label the axes x for value, y for density, and z for time (since the oldest steps seem to recede backwards into the distance)

  Hi Daniel. Thank you for the clarification! I want to confirm one more thing before start writing the description. Is it accurate to state the density the "probability density"? Thanks!

		It's a normalized density. I wouldn't describe it as a probability density,
although I think calling it one would be justifiable.

		Did this get documented somewhere?  I'm trying to understand the tensorboard outputs in detail; a link at the end of this to where the updated docs are would be great. :D

		Take a look here. &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/tensorboard_histograms&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/tensorboard_histograms&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Or in the README for the dashboard, seen here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/tensorboard/plugins/histograms/README.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/tensorboard/plugins/histograms/README.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
