Hello, this is more of a question rather than an issue report.
I am trying to convert a yolov4 model into a tflite to no avail.
After reading through:

https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/lite/TFLiteConverter
https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/inference_with_metadata/lite_support
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/lite/Interpreter

I am unable to find any details regarding appending data in the .
There are guides that require more than 1 output details, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vardanagarwal/Proctoring-AI/blob/master/coco%20models/tflite%20mobnetv1%20ssd/seg_tflite.py#L64-L69&gt;here's an example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
; which then can be translated into bbox, classes, scores, and number of detections respectively.
Are there any documentations that can give me a lead on this question?
