	<summary>Documentation: Updating tutorials to use TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS).</summary>
	<description>
TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) is a collection of datasets ready-to-use with TensorFlow. Each dataset is defined as a tfds.core.DatasetBuilder, which encapsulates the logic to download the dataset and construct an input pipeline, as well as contains the dataset documentation (version, splits, number of examples, etc.).
The purpose of this issue is to migrate all tutorials to use TensorFlow Datasets, and to be compliant with the TF 2.0 API. Each migrated tutorial must be eager and distribution compatible, with tests, and all associated engineering artifacts.

		I want to contribute.
Is this referring to imports like 


tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py


         Line 33
      in
      226398b






 from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data 




 where we would maybe want to import data from Tensorflow Datasets:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
ds_train, ds_test = tfds.load(name="mnist", split=["train", "test"])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rsepassi&gt;@rsepassi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 would be the best contact, and is working with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yashk2810&gt;@yashk2810&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 + several other members of the TensorFlow team to get tutorials ready for TF 2.0. Also make sure to follow progress on these two issues for TFDS support and testing: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/31&gt;#31&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Ryan, Yash - are there any tutorials on GitHub right now that Piyush could help migrate?

		Thatâ€™s great, thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/piyush-kgp&gt;@piyush-kgp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. TFDS is now TF 2.0-ready and can be used in the tutorials. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yashk2810&gt;@yashk2810&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and his colleagues can coordinate work on the tutorials.
