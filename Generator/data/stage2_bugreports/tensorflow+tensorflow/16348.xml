	<summary>Change RELEASE.md to specify CUDA version</summary>
	<description>
The RELEASE.md states that "Prebuilt binaries are now built against CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7."
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/15604&gt;#15604&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says that CUDA 9.1 is not supported.
Could we change the RELEASE.md so that it says "Prebuilt binaries are now built against CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7." until later versions are supported?
