	<summary>Documentation mentions FeatureValueToId, but it's not found anywhere on the site.</summary>
	<description>
The latest documentation on tensorflow.org expains that for embedding_lookup* functions ids are obtained typically from FeatureValueTold. The last term is not found anywhere else on the site. Probably some remnant from ancient functions.
It should probably be replaced with index_table_from* or something similar.

 could you add a link to the bad documentation, please? I'm not seeing "FeatureValueTold" on tensorflow.org, but it could be that I'm not searching well enough.

sp_ids: N x M SparseTensor of int64 ids (typically from FeatureValueToId), where N is typically batch size and M is arbitrary.
I was seeing it on tf.nn.embedding_lookup as well but that seems to be fixed now.

		I think we got bit by the similarity of the glyphs for capital-i, and lowercase-L. "FeatureValueToId" gets a few more hits, while "FeatureValueTold" isn't on the site.
However, even FeatureValueToId doesn't have much visible code or documentation. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zheng-xq&gt;@zheng-xq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, are the docs out of date (so we should remove the old reference and replace it with something more recent)?
