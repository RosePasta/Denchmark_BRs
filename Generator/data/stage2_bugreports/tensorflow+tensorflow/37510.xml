GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: - Bazel
version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from
source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
I'm using the following lines to set allow growth on TF 2.0 like I used to with tf.config and sessions on TF1:
physical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
assert len(physical_devices) &gt; 0, "Not enough GPU hardware devices available"
tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
I've updated from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0 (via pip install) and suddenly tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU') stopped listing my GPU as an available device.
Describe the expected behavior
When downgrading to 2.0.1 (again via pip install) everything works again.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf

physical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
assert len(physical_devices) &gt; 0, "Not enough GPU hardware devices available"
tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Could you please provide information about your system configuration? Which cuda/cuDNN versions have you installed? You can find tested configurations at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ok, from your link I have to assume it's a CUDA version issue. I'm currently on Ubuntu 18.04 with CUDA 10.0 + cuDNN 7.6.5
Unfortunately I cannot test this right now, I'll close the issue and comment again with results once I find the time.

		Tensorflow 2.1 is not compatible with CUDA 10.0. You will have install CUDA 10.1 along with 10.0 or make new conda environment and with tensorflow-gpu=2.1.0. Conda will install Cuda 10.1 for that environment.
conda install anaconda tensorflow-gpu=2.1.0
