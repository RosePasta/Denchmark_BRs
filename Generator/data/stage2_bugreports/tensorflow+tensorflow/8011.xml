	<summary>TypeError: Fetch argument None has invalid type &amp;lt;class 'NoneType'&amp;gt;</summary>
	<description>
Feature request for a better error description OR for better summary handling:
The following code works fine if some summaries where defined before:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ops=[] 
ops += [tf.summary.merge_all()]
session.run(ops)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However if there were no summaries we get:
TypeError: Fetch argument None has invalid type &lt;class 'NoneType'&gt;
Which is really saying:  "One of the session.run ops where empty, which is forbidden."
Alternatively let merge_all return a NoOp if there are no summaries.
