	<summary>tf.get_collection documentation: argument description is confusing</summary>

From &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/get_collection&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/get_collection&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
"Items without a name attribute are never returned if a scope is supplied and the choice or re.match means that a scope without special tokens filters by prefix."
What does this mean? Is there a typo here?

		I think that's "of" rather than "or". Let me check internally.

		Yes, that should be an "of", and we should probably also insert a comma before "and the choice" to make the structure clearer.
