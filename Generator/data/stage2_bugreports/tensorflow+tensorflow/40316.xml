System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): JetPack 4.3 (Ubuntu 18.04)
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.15.2
Python version:3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.26.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):7.5.0
CUDA/cuDNN version:10.0/7.6.3
GPU model and memory:Jetson AGX Xavier (GPU Volta)

Describe the current behavior
I'm trying to create an executable of my code (C++) which is using opencv and tensorflow. For this, I have to use autotools which is a tool used to create Makefiles. I'm successfully making my executable but I'm trying to use it I always have this error :
2020-06-09 14:02:25.158088: E tensorflow/core/lib/monitoring/collection_registry.cc:77] Cannot register 2 metrics with the same name: /tensorflow/cc/saved_model/load_attempt_count 2020-06-09 14:02:25.158383: E tensorflow/core/lib/monitoring/collection_registry.cc:77] Cannot register 2 metrics with the same name: /tensorflow/cc/saved_model/load_latency 2020-06-09 14:02:25.158467: E tensorflow/core/lib/monitoring/collection_registry.cc:77] Cannot register 2 metrics with the same name: /tensorflow/cc/saved_model/load_latency_by_stage 2020-06-09 14:02:25.159111: F tensorflow/core/framework/variant_op_registry.cc:53] Check failed: existing == nullptr (0x55a3931838 vs. nullptr)Unary VariantDecodeFn for type_name: tensorflow::data::WrappedDatasetVariant already registered Aborted (core dumped) 
I do not really understand why,because I have included the required tensorflow flags in my configuration as you can see below :
AM_LDFLAGS = -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_videoio -ltensorflow_cc -ltensorflow_framework -lprotobuf -lprotoc
Any help would be much appreciated, thanks !

		Hi, thanks for your quick reply. I'm working on some object detection and my code is exactly the same as the one here : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lysukhin/tensorflow-object-detection-cpp&gt;https://github.com/lysukhin/tensorflow-object-detection-cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (I'm trying to compile the main.cpp file and to use the utils.h as a shared librarie).

		Hi, just to save you some time for other issues, I wanted to let know that I've solved my issue this morning. It was coming from my tensorflow-cpp installation, I was using the wrong flags ( probably the monolitic one which is bad for the Jetson Xavier). For my new installation, I've used the nonccl flag and the noaws flag. Everything is working perfectly now.
