	<summary>Hexagon build fails, readme.md needs to be revisited.</summary>
	<description>
OS: Ubuntu 16.04 64bits
Android Version: 7.1 (Nougat)
NDK Version: android-ndk-r12b
Hexagon build readme should be revisited after recent code changes.
I used same command as given in the readme.md
tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_android.sh -x /home/kzos/TFHEXLIBS -t hexagon_graph_execution -s /home/kzos/experiment/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/sub_makefiles/hexagon_graph_execution/Makefile.in
I am getting below error:
'
tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile:46: *** "hexagon is only supported on Android".  Stop.

 , mind to share quick build-command/script for hexagon before you publish ?

		The code has not been changed while.  Try checking the value in TARGET.

I am checking,
were you able to get the hexagon_graph_execution built using same command mentioned in README?
