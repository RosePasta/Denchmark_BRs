Original:
: A list of  that has length .
1-D tensor of length 5. The size of the window for each dimension of
the input tensor. Must have .
I think
ksize[0] = ksize[1] = 1. should change to ksize[0] = ksize[4] = 1, according to the test file 


tensorflow/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/pooling_ops_3d_test.py

 ksize=[1, window[0], window[1], window[2], 1],

		This looks to be the case, and it seems like MaxPool3D, MaxPoolGrad3D, AvgPoolGrad3D all have the same issue. Thanks.
