	<summary>DataLossError (see above for traceback): not an sstable (bad magic number)</summary>
	<description>
hi, @tensorflow.org.I got a problem in this case. I can run this code in windows, but I can't run this in my Ubuntu 16.04.I got a DataLossError. But the model was found in this case. And this model can run in windows.
I got this Error. So sad.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;DataLossError (see above for traceback): not an sstable (bad magic number)
	 [[Node: save/RestoreV2 = RestoreV2[dtypes=[DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, ..., DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](_arg_save/Const_0_0, save/RestoreV2/tensor_names, save/RestoreV2/shape_and_slices)]]

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the code is like this.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ckpt_filename = '/home/yangziyuan/SSD-Tensorflow/checkpoints/ssd_300_vgg.ckpt'
isess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
saver = tf.train.Saver()
saver.restore(isess.ckpt_filename)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But saver.restore() stopped everything.
So anyone has any clue? Thanks for your guys time and patience.

@DDDoriM1 - Hi, please check if this helps.

Thanks a lot. I've checked this link. It seems like can not solve this problem. Actually there is only .ckpt in this model file. And the version I used is tensorflow-gpu 1.11. I can't run this code in LInux, but it can work in Windows. So confused.
Thanks!!!!!

		Are you sure you have the file and it's not truncated? What's the magic that you're getting instead?

		I still encounter the same problem. There is no problem for the loading paths. What is the solution?
