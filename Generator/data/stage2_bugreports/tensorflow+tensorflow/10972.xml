	<summary>Tensorflow 1.2: FileWriter needs to be created after tf.text.summary ops?</summary>
	<description>
The following works and creates a tf.text.summary which I can find via tensorboard:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
summary_op = tf.summary.text('config/config', tf.convert_to_tensor('hello world'))
summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/tensorboard', sess.graph)
text = sess.run(summary_op)
summary_writer.add_summary(text, 0)
summary_writer.add_summary(text, 100)
summary_writer.add_summary(text, 200)
summary_writer.flush()
summary_writer.close()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6200749/27425155-c4a1199a-5737-11e7-89f8-9ae3bd4159b4.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If we change the order of the FileWriter and the summary_op above it does not log anything:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/tensorboard', sess.graph)
summary_op = tf.summary.text('config/config', tf.convert_to_tensor('hello world'))
text = sess.run(summary_op)
summary_writer.add_summary(text, 0)
summary_writer.add_summary(text, 100)
summary_writer.add_summary(text, 200)
summary_writer.flush()
summary_writer.close()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6200749/27425124-a2af2926-5737-11e7-9daa-53cda286cc67.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Does this happen with non-text summaries?

		The scalar data appears just fine as demonstrated here:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('/tmp/tensorboard', sess.graph)
summary_op = tf.summary.text('config/config', tf.convert_to_tensor('hello world'))
another_summary_op = tf.summary.scalar('scalar/data', tf.convert_to_tensor(3.14))
text = sess.run(summary_op)
scalar = sess.run(another_summary_op)
for data in [text, scalar]:
    summary_writer.add_summary(data, 0)
    summary_writer.add_summary(data, 100)
    summary_writer.add_summary(data, 200)
summary_writer.flush()
summary_writer.close()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I had a similar problem.
My workaround: I created the plugins/tensorboard_text directory with the tensors.json file (containing the name of the tensor) and then it worked for me. So my educated guess is, that the FileWriter needs the information that summary contains a tf.text.summary to create the named file/directory.

		Both of the code-samples given by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hholst80&gt;@hholst80&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the original report fail for me with the most recent git version of TF (v1.3.0-rc1-810-g349932f) -- the  folder is created, and contains a tfevents file, but that is the only thing in the folder (i.e. there is no  subfolder, or anything else).

		Not sure if this helps any, but it turns out that by restoring some of the code that was present in the git tree at tag r1.2, the plugins subfolder and asset file is written.  Before the return t_summary line in tensorflow/python/summary/text_summary.py should be the following lines:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;text_assets = plugin_asset.get_plugin_asset(TextSummaryPluginAsset)
text_assets.register_tensor(t_summary.op.name)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This does re-introduce the annoying "WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing __tensorboard_plugin_asset__tensorboard_text." message, but at least the plugins folder is created.
BUT, even though the config header shows up in tensorboard now, it still doesn't show the hello world string when expanded -- only an empty config/config item.

		One other note:  I  able to use tensorboard to see text summaries in tfevents files created from an older TF version (git commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/08ed32dbb9e8f67eec9efce3807b5bdb3933eb2f&gt;08ed32d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).  I visually inspected two raw tfevents files (one whose text summaries can be viewed, and another whose summaries can't be viewed), and both contain the text-summary content (what  be displayed in tensorboard), so the data is being written somehow to the tfrecord file in either case.
So, what this means is that there seem to be two issues:

the missing plugins folder and contents, and
a new (buggy?) way that the text data is being written to the tfrecord file which tensorboard doesn't like (doesn't show the text data).

		Since you guys are using 1.3, one thing to note is that we recently moved TensorBoard out of the TensorFlow repository.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chihuahua&gt;@chihuahua&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 made some changes to text summaries recently, so he would be the best person to comment.

we recently moved TensorBoard out of the TensorFlow repository.

â€¦and please note that using TensorBoard from source (GitHub master) requires the latest TensorFlow nightly. The tensorflow-tensorboard package does not require this.

Long ago, as was the case in TensorFlow 1.2, text summaries wrote a separate  directory that TensorBoard would later use to compute relevant plugins. This "plugin assets" system for implementing plugins in TensorBoard exhibited some downsides and bugs (such as the original issue raised by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hholst80&gt;@hholst80&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
We thus deprecated the plugin assets system (and TensorFlow 1.3 stopped creating the now irrelevant plugins directory when text summaries are written) in favor of storing plugin data within tensor values written to disk.
TensorBoard at HEAD (of the GitHub repo) can read both old-style (plugin assets) and new-style (tensor summary based) text summaries. However, the current release of TensorBoard (0.1.2) is too old to be able to read the new-style summaries.

The problem noticed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/edgimar&gt;@edgimar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 stems from how TensorFlow 1.3 writes new-style summaries, but TensorBoard 0.1.2 can't parse them.
TensorBoard team is currently working on a 0.1.3 release of TensorBoard that will solve this problem.

 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/edgimar&gt;@edgimar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , could you please try running
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install tensorflow==1.3.0 tensorflow-tensorboard==0.1.4
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and seeing if this fixes your problem? Note that TensorBoard 0.1.4 requires TensorFlow at least 1.3.0, which was released today.

 With TF version 1.3.0 and TB 0.1.4, text summaries seem to be working.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chihuahua&gt;@chihuahua&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thanks for the explanation!
