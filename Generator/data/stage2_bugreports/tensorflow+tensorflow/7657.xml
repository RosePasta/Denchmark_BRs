	<summary>is_jpeg function only detects JFIF and not EXIF jpeg images in decode_image()</summary>
	<description>
I am using tf.image.decode_image() function to dynamically decode jpeg, png or gif on the fly. However inside decode_image(), it checks if passed tensor if jpeg image using this condition:
is_jpeg = math_ops.equal(substr, b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0', name='is_jpeg')
EXIF files have a marker of 0xffe1, JFIF files have a marker of 0xffe0. So all code that relies on 0xffe0 to detect a JPEG file will miss all EXIF files.
When I patched it to only match first 3 bytes, its working fine.

		Good catch. Could you submit a PR that replaces the check as
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;is_jpeg = math_ops.or(math_ops.equal(substr, b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0', name='is_jfif'), math_ops.equal(substr, b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe1', name='is_exif'), name='is_jpeg')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(that's a little more conservative than your 3 byte check, but it is in the same spirit.) Thanks so much!

		Ok sure. Have never contributed to open source project till now. Any guides out there?
