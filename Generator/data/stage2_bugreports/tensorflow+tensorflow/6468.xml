	<summary>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'legacy_seq2seq'</summary>
	<description>
I am running the ptb_rnn_lm.py. The tensorflow version is 0.12. The error is occurring in the line:
loss = tf.contrib.legacy_seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example(
[logits],
[tf.reshape(input_.targets, [-1])],
[tf.ones([batch_size * num_steps], dtype=data_type())])
The entire error log is:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Pls help soon !!

		I even downloaded and manually copied the legacy_sec2sec folder into the contrib folder. Unfortunately this didnt work either. Pls help !!

		I have worked this out. I am using tf.nn.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example.This is working.

		It seemed like its working but it may not. Getting a new error, which may be connected to this change:

		I had the same problem as you, applied your change and now it works fine, so I don't think its about that line(model is still training i will update when it finishes)

		mlad3n I am sharing my code please please take a look:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://pastebin.com/FM6M43w7&gt;http://pastebin.com/FM6M43w7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The error is as I stated above. I am new to tensorflow.

		My code:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://pastebin.com/6BSp8qhX&gt;http://pastebin.com/6BSp8qhX&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm running it with python 3.5

		mlad3n, I tried it on python 2.7. I just changed the concat_v2 to concat, with the order of arguments changed as suggested &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6345&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. But the same issue I told before is coming up. Canu pls share ur reader.py code too? As the reader.py I had didnt contain ptb_producer. I manually added that function in my code. It would be a big help if u share the reader.py code. Thanks in advance !! Besides which version of tensorflow are u using?

		i tried mlad3n's code on python 3.5, the same exception of mismatched shape occured as sharod, i used the reader.py as given in the master branch.

		try change slice back into strided_slice would fix the problem.

		The file you are using has been moved here:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/rnn/ptb
Are you sure you have all the updates that are made in that file?

		I assume tensorflow/models &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/824&gt;#824&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will fix this but please respond to this issue once that PR lands, if it doesn't.

		Closing due to inactivity. I think the models repository was updated to fix this issue, too.
