	<description>
Hi, Im newbie on tensorflow.
How to use embedding_rnn_seq2seq on tensorflow v2? On tensorflow v1, it is in contrib.legacy_seq2seq class.

		Yes, I have read the documentation. I have tried implementing tf_upgrade_v2, but the tf.contrib.legcy_seq2seq.embedding_rnn_seq2seq has not changed. I also read &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180907-contrib-sunset.md&gt;contrib_sunset&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which states that legacy_seq2seq was replaced by seq2seq on the tensorflow_addons module. But that doesn't work, it works for the sequence_loss method which is in v1, that method is in the same module as embedding_rnn_seq2seq.

		See basic decoder and encoder &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/seq2seq&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 usages for TF1 and TF2
Also see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/seq2seq&gt;tfa.seq2seq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 module.
