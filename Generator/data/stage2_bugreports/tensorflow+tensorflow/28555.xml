		Hi Jens,
This is because we accidentally leaked profiling code to the TF Lite part and broke TFL micro. It should have been solved by now. Could you try again?
Thanks,

Hi!
It compiles fine now, although the tests themselves fails with the message included in logs.txt.

		Eh... WaitUntilLine
Sounds like you need to type enter on you console?

		Thanks Jens! Unfortunately there are some timeout issues with the Renode software emulation testing. I'm closing this one since the original issue is solved, but we have a new team who will be helping improve the emulation tests on our side, so hopefully the bluepill testing should become more reliable.
