Describe the problem
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem
Official colab link for tensorboard 2.0 demo is able to reproduce the bug:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/r2/get_started.ipynb&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/r2/get_started.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ pip install -q tf-nightly-2.0-preview

ERROR: thinc 6.12.1 has requirement wrapt&lt;1.11.0,&gt;=1.10.0, but you'll have wrapt 1.11.1 which is incompatible.

 When I ran the command pip install -q tf-nightly-2.0-preview , I get the error. And if I remove -q then the error is not shown.

		It does work with the method you mentioned, i.e without the -q parameter. Thank you.
But why? It's so frustrating.

 Where did you see that  command? In &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip&gt;TF website&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it was not mentioned with . Thanks!

@wxdao Where did you see that -q command? In TF website, it was not mentioned with -q. Thanks!

It's in every official tutorial colab notebook, like &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/r2/get_started.ipynb&gt;this one&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so I thought I was supposed to add -q too.

		-q is a pip flag:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  -q, --quiet                 Give less output. Option is additive, and can be
                              used up to 3 times (corresponding to WARNING,
                              ERROR, and CRITICAL logging levels).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The issue here is not caused by TensorFlow. In the python environment you're using (virtualenv? global install?) you already have an incompatible version of thinc. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling that with the required version number
