System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
I have created a notebook that downloads pretrained model from tf2 detection model zoo and performs prediction using saved model . The notebook is working fine on other models such as centernet, faster rcnn etc. But whenever I download efficient det using the download function below it issues a series of warnings.
MY DOWNLOAD FUNCTION
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def download_model(model_name):
  
   
  download_url = 'http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/'
  
  
  pretrained_model = model_name
  
  
  model_file = pretrained_model + '.tar.gz'

  
  
      
  !wget {download_url + model_file}
  tar = tarfile.open(model_file)
  tar.extractall()
  tar.close

    
  model_dir= os.getcwd() + '/' + pretrained_model        # determine the path to saved model 
  model_dir=pathlib.Path(model_dir)/'saved_model'
  model= tf.saved_model.load(str(model_dir))

  return model

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The warnings I encounter:

Describe the expected behavior
Eventhough my Efficient Det Model runs ok, I don't understand why is this warning being issued and how to get rid of it. I am making a notebook tutorial for others to understand TFOD but these warnings make my notebook look messy. Is there anyway I can get rid of those?
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
The warnings occur while using this code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model_name= 'efficientdet_d1_coco17_tpu-32'
model= download_model(model_name)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		As mentioned before, we don't support custom gradients - but there are too many warnings there, we'll work on making them less verbose.

@AshTech25 Are you training/fine-tuning the model?

No I'm just using the model for my inferences

So without the training you will not got the error but the warning has the same origin

As mentioned before, we don't support custom gradients - but there are too many warnings there, we'll work on making them less verbose.

I observe the same with EfficientNetBX from tf.keras.applications. Still, I do not get an error when finetuning the model. Is the gradient computation failing silently?
