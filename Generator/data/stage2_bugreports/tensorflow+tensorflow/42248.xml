Describe the current behavior
tf.keras.backend.reverse crashes (segfault) when first dimension of x is 0
Describe the expected behavior
expect no crashes
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.keras.backend.reverse(x=np.ndarray(shape=[0, 1, 1]), axes=1)
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
