	<summary>Issue on Load Trax</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Docker container: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel-gpu (sha256:81b1629c567b638dbc197aa24aa7aaa22b84ae88d1bb6c963fa7e3d970cbe77e)
CUDA/cuDNN version: Cuda compilation tools, release 11.0, V11.0.221
Build cuda_11.0_bu.TC445_37.28845127_0
GPU model and memory: nvidia gtx 1060 6gb

Describe the current behavior
I have installed jupyter in the tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel-gpu  docker image, I'm running the following files:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!pip install --upgrade jax
!pip install --upgrade jaxlib
!pip install --upgrade trax

!pip install --upgrade 'https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/cuda110/jaxlib-0.1.51-cp36-none-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl'

!pip install --upgrade jax
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from jax.lib import xla_bridge
print(xla_bridge.get_backend().platform)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But when I run this code, I'm getting the following error (The GPU is not loading):
E external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:314] failed call to cuInit: UNKNOWN ERROR (-1)
Describe the expected behavior
When I run the code with the docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly-gpu-jupyter everything is working as expected.

Is tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel-gpu updated?

Yes, I have already test it today 2020-9-23 using tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel-gpu image updated without using cache.
