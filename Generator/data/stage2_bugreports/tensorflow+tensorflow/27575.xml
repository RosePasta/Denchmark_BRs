	<summary>State build requires bazel &amp;lt;=0.23.0 for v2.0.0-alpha0</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a documentation issue. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:doc_template
System information

TensorFlow version: v2.0.0-alpha0
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows#install_bazel

Describe the documentation issue
I downloaded the latest (at the time of writing, 0.24.1) Bazel binary and when I tried to ./configure.py I got this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;You have bazel 0.24.1 installed.
Please downgrade your bazel installation to version 0.23.0 or lower to build TensorFlow! To downgrade: download the installer for the old version (from https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases) then run the installer.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think it would be useful to state explicitly that 0.23.0 is the version required to build Tensorflow to save some time. I even just downloaded 0.23.2 because I didn't see that the message says 0.23.0 and sure enough, I got the same complaint about 0.23.2.
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
Yes. Will do a PR shortly.
