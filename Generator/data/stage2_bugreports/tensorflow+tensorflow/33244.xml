	<summary>Model has not been built yet</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0-beta1
Python version:3.7..3
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): [GCC 7.3.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP102 [GeForce GTX 1080 Ti] (rev a1)

I have downloaded the official example of Convolutional Variational Autoencoder from this &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If one starts to execute this file everything looks fine but the problem arises when one wants to save the weight or call the summary() method. (i.e.) model.summary(). This produces the following error:
ValueError: This model has not yet been built. Build the model first by calling build() or calling fit() with some data, or specify an input_shape argument in the first layer(s) for automatic build.
PS, I faced the same issue in  my costume code as well. since the file is large I prevent to provide it here but you can find it in this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sorooshi/ML4DC/blob/development/my_ope.ipynb&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Any Idea what's going on?! And how to overcome this challenge.
Thanks in advance.

		Issue replicating for the given gist when tried using .
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sorooshi&gt;@Sorooshi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you also provide working link for your custom model,as the provided link is not working.Thanks!

 I have seen this post previously, but this post has nothing to do with my problem.
In that (stack overflow) post the model is not build because input shape is not passed in the first layer. But the problem which I reported completely different.

		Could reproduce the issue in TF Version 2.0. Here is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/rmothukuru/2b25e9e918c489d0edac1865b888f5fb/33244.ipynb&gt;Gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  No I can't reproduce this error with TF Version 2.0.

 This is intended behavior. The error clearly mentions root-cause of the issue.
This is the response from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fchollet&gt;@fchollet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25036&gt;similar issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as yours.

You can do model.summary or saving weights with Sequential or functional models because those models are static graphs. In contrast, a subclassed model is a piece of Python code (a call method). There is no graph of layers here. We cannot know how layers are connected to each other (because that's defined in the body of call, not as an explicit data structure), so we cannot infer input / output shapes.
Please see this detailed explanation of the differences between Functional/Sequential models and imperative models: https://medium.com/tensorflow/what-are-symbolic-and-imperative-apis-in-tensorflow-2-0-dfccecb01021

I am closing the issue as it was resolved. Please feel free to open a new issue if there is any other related issue. Thanks!
