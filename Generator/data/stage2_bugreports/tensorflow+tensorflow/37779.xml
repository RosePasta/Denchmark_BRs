	<summary>UnavailableError: Socket closed while using custom training loop</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
Tensorflow version: 2.1.0

About hardware and software system information I'm using Kaggle kernels so more information can be found here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-python&gt;https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Describe the current behavior
I'm getting errors like the one below, this happens during the training loop.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16668746/77226592-4b217780-6b58-11ea-8d38-eedea01ca32a.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
The model was supposed to train normally.

Other info / logs
As described on the notebook linked above usually happens when using some combination of the below:

Long epochs
Heavy models
Some loops using too much memory

I tried to reproduce the issue, but am facing an error stating . Please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/5abc237bc2d480af07cf57edf4aacd1c/37779-2-1.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
In order to expedite the trouble-shooting process, could you please provide the complete code to reproduce the issue reported along with all the supporting files. Thanks!

, you have to run the code on Kaggle.
If you prefer running it in a different place, you can copy the data to your own GCS bucket. That's the only thing KaggleDatasets().get_gcs_path() does: it copies the data to a GCS bucket close to the TPU and returns the GCS path.

 as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martin-gorner&gt;@martin-gorner&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said to reproduce the same code that I used you would need the lib  and I don't think you would be able to use it on Google colab.
Another thing as I mentioned &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/flower-classification-with-tpus/discussion/135443#783021&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this issue seems to be related to memory allocation, I was able to run the code doing some modifications that would reduce memory usage, like removing  and reducing iteration count on the validation set. Maybe this can shed some light on solving the problem. Maybe if the problem is really related to memory just a more appropriate error message would do the work.

 where is the  method defined? I couldn't find it in the shared notebook.
Why are you using dataset.cache() in the dataset? That could cause memory issues. Is it too slow to read the dataset everytime?

		<comment id='5' author='dimitreOliveira' date='2020-04-05T19:55:12Z'>
		Also - are you able to run with latest TF nightly on kaggle? Or is 2.1 the only option?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dimitreOliveira&gt;@dimitreOliveira&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, when investigating the set of TPU stability issues reported on Kaggle, we found at least one that goes away with TF 2.2. I need to try this one.

 the  was hidden but I will copy it here for you
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def get_validation_dataset(filenames, ordered=True, repeated=False):
    dataset = load_dataset(filenames, labeled=True, ordered=ordered)
    if repeated:
        dataset = dataset.repeat()
        dataset = dataset.shuffle(2048)
    dataset = dataset.batch(BATCH_SIZE)
    dataset = dataset.cache()
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(AUTO)
    return dataset
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The dataset.cache() was just to make things a little faster, but I was not using TF nightly but I guess it is possible to install and run it.

 What TF 2.2 has that solves the issue? and is it stable, if it is I can start experimenting with it as well.

		Just finished testing. TF 2.2 resolves two out of the three reported stability issues I am tracking. Yours is the third one. Your model errors out immediately with this error under TF2.2:
InvalidArgumentError: {{function_node __inference_train_step_137283}} Compilation failure: Output shapes of then and else branches do not match

 do you think this might be because of the custom augmentation functions where I use  and  statements?

		<comment id='11' author='dimitreOliveira' date='2020-04-07T00:10:12Z'>
		Probably but also probably not your fault. This was working in TF 2.1, it
should still work in TF 2.2.

 I have been able to confirm that the "then and else branches do not match" is a horrible bug deep down in the XLA compiler. It is not related to your data augmentation code. It has now been fixed. The next release of Tensorflow (TF2.2rc3 or TF2.2 release) will make your model work. Thank you for helping us find this.

		I'm closing this issue since it will be solved by future a TensorFlow version.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
