	<summary>LSTM with sample_weight fails with batch_size &amp;gt; 1</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Debian 9.9
TensorFlow installed from: pip
TensorFlow version: 1.13.1
Python version: 3.7.3
GPU model and memory: n/a - tested in CPU mode

Describe the current behavior
An unexpected error occurs when training an LSTM with sample_weight and batch_size &gt; 1. The error does not occur if batch_size = 1, or if omitting sample_weight.
Describe the expected behavior
I would expect to be able to train an LSTM using  and . As far as I understand it,  can be used for weighting the loss function, and according to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/Model&gt;docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it can be "a flat (1D) Numpy array with the same length as the input samples" - i.e. same length as .
Code to reproduce the issue
Here's a minimal example:
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 32
sequence_len = 1
embedding_size = 100

x_train = np.random.randn(batch_size, sequence_len, embedding_size)
y_train = np.random.randn(batch_size, embedding_size)
sample_weight = np.random.randn(batch_size)

train_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(sequence_len, embedding_size),
                             batch_size=batch_size)

lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(200,
                                  return_sequences=False,
                                  )(train_input)

dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(embedding_size,
                                    )(lstm_layer)

model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=train_input, outputs=dense_layer)

model.summary()

model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.RMSprop(lr=0.001),
              loss=tf.losses.mean_squared_error)

loss = model.train_on_batch(x_train,
                            y=y_train,
                            sample_weight=sample_weight)

		I don't think this is the issue for LSTM, but more generally for loss and sample weights. Adding &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pavithrasv&gt;@pavithrasv&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Tried to reproduce the issue, it repros on nightly but does not repro on 2.0 nightly. Yet to dig into what changed between the versions with regards to this issue.

		The issue is because you are using tf.losses.mean_squared_error with keras. This is not supported in 1.x. TensorFlow losses do not work with Keras in 1.x. You can replace the loss with tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error or simple the string 'mse' and your code should work.
Please let me know if that fixed the issue for you. Thanks!

 Great, I agree that this resolves the issue. Thanks a lot!
