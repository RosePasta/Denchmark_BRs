	<summary>Cuda 10: Failed to get device properties, error code: 3</summary>
	<description>
I am using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet&gt;keras-retinanet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (0.5.0) to perform object detection on images using its TensorFlow backend. When I  their pre-trained COCO model, the GPU is initialized as expected:

However, when calling predict_on_batch on this model afterwards, the GPU cannot be initialized any more:

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no custom code, but TensorFlow is called through keras-retinanet
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Gentoo (Base System release 2.6)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary from PyPi
TensorFlow version: 1.13.1
Python version: 3.6.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0.130 / 7.4.2.24
GPU model and memory: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (11 GB memory)
Nvidia driver version: 418.43

Describe the current behavior
see above
Describe the expected behavior
There should be no error initializing the GPU when using predict_on_batch. On other machines I have used older versions (TF 1.10.0 with CUDA 9.0) and it worked fine.
Code to reproduce the issue

Install CUDA 10, cuDNN 7.4.2
Install tensorflow-gpu 1.13.1 (or 1.13.0rc1/rc2) and keras-retinanet 0.5.0 into a virtualenv from PyPi
Download pre-trained COCO model from here
Load the model using model = keras_retinanet.models.load_model('path/to/model.h5') (will generate first blob of output above)
Predict bounding boxes on an image via model.predict_on_batch(np.expand_dims(my_image, axis=0)) (will generate second blob of output above)

Other info / logs
I am reporting this here and not at the keras-retinanet project because it seems to be a TensorFlow internal issue. Furthermore, it has worked fine with the same version of keras-retinanet when using older versions of TF and CUDA (see above).
Thank you!
