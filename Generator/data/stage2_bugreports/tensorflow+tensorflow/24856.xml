Describe the documentation issue
I was looking through the eager execution documentation and one of the links is missing the extension 'ipynb'. If you click on the "eager execution guide" the link is broken.

		The link you are pointing in this issue is incorrect since you are the owner of the repo.
I think you meant this link for the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/eager&gt;eager execution guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Can you please confirm?

		Jeez, copy and paste issue.
Here is the page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/eager/index.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/eager/index.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If you look at the link "eager execution guide" it goes to "&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/guide/eager&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/guide/eager&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
" which gets a 404.

		I can edit the original if that would make more sense.
