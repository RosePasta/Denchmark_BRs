	<summary>Saving tf.keras.Sequential model fails with RNN containing more than one GRUCell</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device if the issue happens on mobile device: -
TensorFlow installed from: binary (tf-nightly-2.0-preview)
TensorFlow version: GIT_VERSION = v1.12.1-7529-g3e0ad8a004, VERSION = 2.0.0-dev20190731
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU only
GPU model and memory: CPU only

Describe the current behavior
Saving a tf.keras.Sequential model with tf.keras.layers.RNN fails when containing more than one tf.keras.layers.GRUCell with error message RuntimeError: Unable to create link (name already exists).
Describe the expected behavior
Saving should succeed, not only when having one cell.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf

# saving succeeds for number_of_cells = 1, but fails for number_of_cells &gt; 1
number_of_cells = 2

model = tf.keras.Sequential()

model.add(tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(1, 1,)))

cells = []

for i in range(number_of_cells):
    cells.append(tf.keras.layers.GRUCell(10))

model.add(tf.keras.layers.RNN(cells))

model.save("rnn.h5")
Other info / logs
Behavior is the same when using SimpleRNNCell instead of GRUCell.
Traceback in case of failure:

Can you try saving the model in tf format? using . It worked fine for me without any issue's. Kindly find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/oanush/84a2c6ef04084c18bbc699bc556c5acb/36093.ipynb#scrollTo=wJL_s5pKUetX&gt;gist of colab &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you for your quick response. I tried with my 2.0.0-dev20190731 installation. It seems to work, but I am getting warnings:

Apparently I need a newer tensorflow version, as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/oanush/84a2c6ef04084c18bbc699bc556c5acb/36093.ipynb#scrollTo=wJL_s5pKUetX&gt;gist of colab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with tf_nightly-2.2.0.dev20200121, most of the warnings do not occur. I would love to install a current snapshot, but whatever I tried has failed so far:


Installing tf-nightly with pip results in installing tf-nightly-1.15.0.dev20190730, which is not as desired.


Installing a wheel package with pip fails with error tf_nightly-2.2.0.dev20200121-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform..


Source build fails eventually with error Server terminated abruptly (error code: 14, error message: 'Socket closed' (see tensorflow/models#3647 (comment)).


Is there any way to install e.g. a tf_nightly-2.2.0.dev20200121 (as seen on the gist of colab) on an Ubuntu 18.04, ideally without building from source?

Hello you can try installing &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly/&gt;nightly version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with , it should work fine!

Unfortunately, that doesn't work for me at all, as in bash, the exclamation mark will substitute the command name with the last command in my history starting by that name - and this is somewhat arbitrary. What was your purpose of the exclamation mark?
If I create a new virtual environment and do pip install tf-nightly, it downloads tf_nightly-1.15.0.dev20190730-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl, which is why I end up with 1.15.0.dev20190730 being installed. By the way, if I download that wheel package manually and install it with pip, it works fine. However, installation of e.g. tf_nightly-2.2.0.dev20200121-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl fails.
Apparently the wheel package downloaded by pip depends on the platform, and tf-nightly seems to be frozen for Ubuntu 18.04 at 1.15.0.dev20190730, is that right?

 Do you have any news? I tried to load the saved tf model in the colab, and it fails. So unfortunately, the workaround does not work, not even with the newest tensorflow version.

 In order to install , you can do this. At the command prompt, enter , then it will install  that was released on 01/29 (today). I tried it on my Linux desktop and it works. Hope it works for you too.
Regarding saving the model in "h5" format, we have another &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35731&gt;similar bug&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We will follow the progress there.
If this was resolved, please close the issue. Thanks!

 Thank you for your reply.
Regarding the model: For me, neither "h5" nor "tf" format work in the end. Saving in "tf" format works, but loading it doesn't  - can't see this issue being mentioned in the other ticket.
Regarding tf-nightly. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for me, I get the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tf-nightly==2.2.0dev20200129 (from versions: 1.13.0.dev20190101, 1.13.0.dev20190102, 1.13.0.dev20190103, 1.13.0.dev20190104, 1.13.0.dev20190108, 1.13.0.dev20190109, 1.13.0.dev20190110, 1.13.0.dev20190111, 1.13.0.dev20190112, 1.13.0.dev20190113, 1.13.0.dev20190114, 1.13.0.dev20190115, 1.13.0.dev20190116, 1.13.0.dev20190117, 1.13.0.dev20190118, 1.13.0.dev20190119, 1.13.0.dev20190120, 1.13.0.dev20190121, 1.13.0.dev20190122, 1.13.0.dev20190123, 1.13.0.dev20190124, 1.13.0.dev20190125, 1.13.0.dev20190203, 1.13.0.dev20190204, 1.13.0.dev20190205, 1.13.0.dev20190206, 1.13.0.dev20190207, 1.13.0.dev20190208, 1.13.0.dev20190211, 1.13.0.dev20190212, 1.13.0.dev20190213, 1.13.0.dev20190214, 1.13.0.dev20190215, 1.13.0.dev20190216, 1.13.0.dev20190217, 1.13.0.dev20190218, 1.13.0.dev20190219, 1.13.0.dev20190220, 1.13.0.dev20190221, 1.13.0.dev20190222, 1.13.0.dev20190223, 1.13.0.dev20190224, 1.13.0.dev20190225, 1.13.0.dev20190226, 1.13.0.dev20190227, 1.13.0.dev20190228, 1.14.1.dev20190301, 1.14.1.dev20190302, 1.14.1.dev20190303, 1.14.1.dev20190304, 1.14.1.dev20190305, 1.14.1.dev20190306, 1.14.1.dev20190307, 1.14.1.dev20190308, 1.14.1.dev20190309, 1.14.1.dev20190310, 1.14.1.dev20190311, 1.14.1.dev20190312, 1.14.1.dev20190313, 1.14.1.dev20190314, 1.14.1.dev20190315, 1.14.1.dev20190316, 1.14.1.dev20190317, 1.14.1.dev20190318, 1.14.1.dev20190319, 1.14.1.dev20190320, 1.14.1.dev20190321, 1.14.1.dev20190322, 1.14.1.dev20190323, 1.14.1.dev20190324, 1.14.1.dev20190325, 1.14.1.dev20190326, 1.14.1.dev20190327, 1.14.1.dev20190329, 1.14.1.dev20190330, 1.14.1.dev20190331, 1.14.1.dev20190401, 1.14.1.dev20190402, 1.14.1.dev20190403, 1.14.1.dev20190404, 1.14.1.dev20190405, 1.14.1.dev20190406, 1.14.1.dev20190407, 1.14.1.dev20190408, 1.14.1.dev20190409, 1.14.1.dev20190410, 1.14.1.dev20190412, 1.14.1.dev20190413, 1.14.1.dev20190414, 1.14.1.dev20190415, 1.14.1.dev20190416, 1.14.1.dev20190417, 1.14.1.dev20190419, 1.14.1.dev20190420, 1.14.1.dev20190421, 1.14.1.dev20190422, 1.14.1.dev20190423, 1.14.1.dev20190424, 1.14.1.dev20190425, 1.14.1.dev20190426, 1.14.1.dev20190427, 1.14.1.dev20190428, 1.14.1.dev20190429, 1.14.1.dev20190430, 1.14.1.dev20190501, 1.14.1.dev20190502, 1.14.1.dev20190503, 1.14.1.dev20190504, 1.14.1.dev20190505, 1.14.1.dev20190506, 1.14.1.dev20190507, 1.14.1.dev20190508, 1.14.1.dev20190509, 1.14.1.dev20190510, 1.14.1.dev20190511, 1.14.1.dev20190512, 1.14.1.dev20190513, 1.14.1.dev20190514, 1.14.1.dev20190515, 1.14.1.dev20190516, 1.14.1.dev20190517, 1.14.1.dev20190518, 1.14.1.dev20190519, 1.14.1.dev20190520, 1.14.1.dev20190521, 1.14.1.dev20190522, 1.14.1.dev20190523, 1.14.1.dev20190524, 1.14.1.dev20190525, 1.14.1.dev20190526, 1.14.1.dev20190527, 1.14.1.dev20190528, 1.14.1.dev20190529, 1.14.1.dev20190530, 1.14.1.dev20190531, 1.14.1.dev20190601, 1.14.1.dev20190602, 1.14.1.dev20190603, 1.14.1.dev20190604, 1.14.1.dev20190605, 1.14.1.dev20190606, 1.14.1.dev20190607, 1.14.1.dev20190608, 1.14.1.dev20190611, 1.14.1.dev20190612, 1.14.1.dev20190613, 1.14.1.dev20190614, 1.14.1.dev20190615, 1.14.1.dev20190616, 1.14.1.dev20190617, 1.14.1.dev20190618, 1.14.1.dev20190619, 1.14.1.dev20190620, 1.14.1.dev20190621, 1.14.1.dev20190622, 1.14.1.dev20190623, 1.14.1.dev20190624, 1.14.1.dev20190625, 1.15.0.dev20190626, 1.15.0.dev20190627, 1.15.0.dev20190628, 1.15.0.dev20190703, 1.15.0.dev20190704, 1.15.0.dev20190705, 1.15.0.dev20190706, 1.15.0.dev20190707, 1.15.0.dev20190708, 1.15.0.dev20190709, 1.15.0.dev20190710, 1.15.0.dev20190711, 1.15.0.dev20190712, 1.15.0.dev20190713, 1.15.0.dev20190714, 1.15.0.dev20190715, 1.15.0.dev20190716, 1.15.0.dev20190717, 1.15.0.dev20190718, 1.15.0.dev20190723, 1.15.0.dev20190724, 1.15.0.dev20190725, 1.15.0.dev20190726, 1.15.0.dev20190727, 1.15.0.dev20190728, 1.15.0.dev20190729, 1.15.0.dev20190730)

 Regarding the installation of , it is strange. You should be able to install with the command I provided. .
Can you please share the command you used? some time unknowingly we use pip instead of pip3.
I have Python 3.6.8 and Linux 5.2.17-1rodete3-amd64 x86_64.
I will check the saving issue and respond to you soon. Thanks!

 I had copy&amp;pasted. Now also created a fresh venv:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;test@test:~/dev/tensorflow$ python3 -m venv tf0
test@test:~/dev/tensorflow$ source tf0/bin/activate
(tf0) test@test:~/dev/tensorflow$ pip3 install tf-nightly==2.2.0dev20200129
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Same result as already posted here. I have Python 3.6.9 and Linux 5.3.0-28-generic x86_64.

 Can you please follow the following steps to make virtual env.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Step 1: $:virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 ./venv_tfnightly

Step 2: source ./venv_tfnightly/bin/activate  

Step 3: pip3 install tf-nightly==2.2.0dev20200129

Step 4: $ python3

Step 5: &gt;&gt;&gt; import tensorflow as tf
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.__version__  # it should print '2.2.0-dev20200129'

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thanks. Hope this helps.

 Thank you, that worked more or less, but after trying a full cleanup of my pip3 packages, because I got a warning due to some old tf packages (not in the virtualenv), something seems to be broken. So in the end I decided to use the nightly docker image, which works like a charm.
With the current nightly (2.2.0-dev20200202), loading the tf model works fine, which solves my problem, so I am closing the ticket. Thanks for the support!

		Apparently, the bug has been fixed in the meanwhile. Saving the model as h5 with 2.2.0-dev20200228 works.
