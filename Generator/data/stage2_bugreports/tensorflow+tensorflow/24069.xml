		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/extend/architecture.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/extend/architecture.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the file to change if you want to submit a PR to fix it. The other link in the paragraph is broken also
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;This document describes the system architecture that makes this
combination of scale and flexibility possible. It assumes that you have basic familiarity
with TensorFlow programming concepts such as the computation graph, operations,
and sessions. See [this document](../guide/low_level_intro.md) for an introduction to
these topics. Some familiarity with [distributed TensorFlow](../deploy/distributed.md)
will also be helpful.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think the first link should be ../low_level_intro.md
and the 2nd link should be ../../deploy/distributed.md
