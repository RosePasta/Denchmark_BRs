You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
When loading a simple Keras Sequential model with two Conv2D layers stored in SavedModel format from disk and applying the tensorflow.keras.models.clone_model() function, a TypeError: ('Keyword argument not understood:', 'filters') is thrown.
Describe the expected behavior
I expect the tensorflow.keras.models.clone_model() to return a clone of the provided model and not fail with an exception.

I was able to reproduce the issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/0db9995e445fc5de96f71f4703d0d403/37234.ipynb&gt;TF 2.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and TF 2.1. However, the issue seems to be fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/e3fdab8e1499358e2acc50445a8cef78/37234-2-1.ipynb&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please check the attached gist. Thanks!

 Thank you very much for investigating this issue! I am gald that the nightly version has already introduced a fix.
I just checked if TF 2.0.1 also contains the fix but it doesn't seem to. Will there be a patch version for TF 2.0 and TF 2.1 some time containig the fix?

If the issue is fixed in the TF-nightly version, we can expect it in the next available stable release. Thanks!
