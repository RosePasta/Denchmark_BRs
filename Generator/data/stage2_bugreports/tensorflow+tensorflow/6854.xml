	<summary>XLA: random numbers are the same across `session.run` calls</summary>
	<description>
Not sure if that's intended, but that changes behavior of training pipelines:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.contrib.compiler import jit
jit_scope = jit.experimental_jit_scope
with jit_scope(compile_ops=True):
    x = tf.random_uniform(())
    
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(x))
print(sess.run(x))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;0.768917
0.768917
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		That's definitely not working as intended. We don't seem to be setting the RNG seed correctly, which is why you get the same result.
I'll check in a change disabling JIT compilation of the RNG ops until they are fixed.

		Actually, it turns out that Tensorflow is constant-folding away the _XlaLaunch ops containing the random-number generation code. Fix coming shortly (mark _XlaLaunch as stateful).

		Good to know it's an easy fix. BTW, if you setup the internal github/google email it'll add you to TensorFlow org automatically and I'll be able to assign future XLA issues to you (martin knows the place for the mapping)

		Hry folks,
  Must have been some typo when you launched this thread. I am not related
to the tensor flow project. You aren't communicating with who you think you
are.

		Ah, I see, I can't be assigned. I emailed Martin to add me to the Github org.

 btw, if you include string like below in CL public description, it'll automatically close the issue when commit is merged:
Fixes issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6854&gt;#6854&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

("Fixes Github issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6854&gt;#6854&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
" does not trigger it)
