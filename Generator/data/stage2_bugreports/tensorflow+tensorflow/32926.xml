	<summary>"Upgrading your code to TensorFlow 2.0" is behind a Medium paywall</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5&gt;https://medium.com/tensorflow/upgrading-your-code-to-tensorflow-2-0-f72c3a4d83b5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This upgrade guide is linked from the TensorFlow 2.0 release notes. If the viewer has exceeded their quota on Medium, they are blocked by a paywall and cannot read the upgrade guide. Is this intentional?

Did you get a chance to go through Tensorflow official website.

		I suggest updating the release notes to link to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/upgrade&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/upgrade&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 instead of the Medium post.

		Yes we're working on moving the blog because of this sort of thing.
If you think this change is important you can send a PR to update: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/RELEASE.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/RELEASE.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ugh, sorry to see that. There's a switch I think we can flip on articles to prevent it - perhaps we missed it. Will take a look.
