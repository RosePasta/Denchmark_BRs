	<summary>A potential null pointer deference bug in GraphProperties class</summary>
	<description>
Dear developers,
I am studying the code of Tensorflow and found a potential null pointer dereference bug in tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/graph_properties.cc
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;The problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The function updateEnter() at line 70 of tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/graph_properties.cc calls the getContext() function of the ShapeRefiner class, which could return a null pointer (line 79 of tensorflow/core/common_runtime/shape_refiner.h) and get stored in the variable enter_ctx. At line 73 of the updateEnter() function, enter_ctx is dereferenced in the for loop condition without being checked against null. If the null pointer dereference is triggered, the program might crash.
I noticed that for another call of the getContext() function at line 255 of tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/graph_properties.cc, the function return value, which gets stored in the variable qctx, is checked against null, indicating that getContext() can indeed return null pointer.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am analyzing the latest version of Tensorflow as of July 31, 2017, and the two relevant files are:
(1) &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/graph_properties.cc&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/graph_properties.cc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4432623ee08ecf145941161ba520397fc22d614f&gt;4432623&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on 1 July)
(2) &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/shape_refiner.h&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/shape_refiner.h&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e85d3df92deb9d717befdf173966a2913ac2aea0&gt;e85d3df&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  on 30 June)
Hope my report helps :)

 Hi Andrew, I would love to help, but I am not sure if wrapping the for loop with a null checker would be correct since the logic of  seems complicated. For the other two call sites of , I found that simple null checkers worked (lines 256-258 and 345-347 of tensorflow/core/grappler/costs/graph_properties.cc at commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4432623ee08ecf145941161ba520397fc22d614f&gt;4432623&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
