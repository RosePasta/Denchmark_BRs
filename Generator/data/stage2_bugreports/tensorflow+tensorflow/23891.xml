	<summary>Can we have working example with assets in the documentation for the simple_save?</summary>

System information

TensorFlow version: 1.12
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/simple_save

Simple_save seems to be a newer and more standardized saving approach. Since it can also use assets to store vocabularies, I wonder if it is possible to have a working example in document based on keras sentiment analysis system's data? So there is place to look up how to really integrate the entire model (including vocabulary, word embedding, etc) in a single simple_save.

 Allen, what is the current best way to save a model and do we have a documentation page for it?
simple_save seems to be deprecated.

		simple_save won't appear in v2. We do have a SavedModel API: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/saved_model&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/saved_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I don't have plans to write a sentiment analysis example, but it does sound useful.
