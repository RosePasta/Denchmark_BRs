	<summary>numpy prod overflow during creating tensor</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to allocate super large tensor using tensorflow, but failed.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py#L417&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_util.py#L417&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Above code uses numpy.prod to calculate shape size, and for numpy everything is typed, say if the shape is [500000000, 5], then numpy.prod returns -1794967296, it's very easy to reproduce it.
So how about use int64 instead? int64 should be large enough for any tensor.
Changing shape_size = np.prod(shape) to shape_size = np.prod(shape, dtype=np.int64) should fix it. Also about 100 lines of code using np.prod, could we change them all to int64?

 Are you on a 32 bit machine?  I get
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; np.prod([500000000, 5])
2500000000
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.prod([500000000, 5]).dtype
dtype('int64')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Explicitly setting dtype=np.int64 does seem like the right solution, but I'd like to understand why it's breaking for you first.

		Maybe it's a Windows issue? &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html#id3&gt;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html#id3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says that the default integer type is the same as a C , which is 32 bits in MSVC.

 I am on 64 bit windows machine, I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry&gt;@mrry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is right, numpy default int type inside windows is 32 bit.

 Would you be up for a pull request?  Adding  sounds good.
