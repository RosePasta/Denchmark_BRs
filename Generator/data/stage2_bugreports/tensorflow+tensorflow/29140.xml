	<summary>cannot import a pretrained mobilenet multiple times</summary>

Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.12
Python version:2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:10.1.105
GPU model and memory: m60, 8gb

I am trying to use a pre-trained MobileNet for transfer learning however i am running into a problem when i am trying to run the same command the second time
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
try:
    del g1
except:
    pass
tf.reset_default_graph()
g1 = tf.Graph() #or g1 = tf.get_default_graph() both result in same behavior
with g1.as_default():
    base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=(160,160,3),
                                                       include_top=False,
                                                       weights='imagenet')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I can run this cell in jupyter alright the first time but the second time i try to run this i get
TypeError: Cannot interpret feed_dict key as Tensor: Tensor Tensor("Placeholder_207:0", shape=(160,), dtype=float32) is not an element of this graph.
However, I can run this cell multiple times perfectly fine
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=(160,160,3),
                                                       include_top=False,
                                                       weights='imagenet')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Sorry for the delay in my response. I ran your code in  and I don't see the issue. That particular block I ran 7 times without any issue. Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/e2439a3866424044d428d3e9567cea1f/untitled588.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks
Please close the issue if the issue was resolved already. Thanks!
