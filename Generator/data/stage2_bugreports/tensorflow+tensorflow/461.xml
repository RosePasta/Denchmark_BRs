	<summary>broken links in word2vec tutorial docs</summary>
	<description>
Some of the links to word2vec_basic.py currently give a 404 -- they point to &lt;denchmark-link:https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py&gt;https://tensorflow.googlesource.com/tensorflow/+/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . They should probably point to the version at  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , right?

		Yeah, we haven't pushed the new website that has these link fixes yet.  We'll probably do so soon.
