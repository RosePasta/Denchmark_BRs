Describe the problem
When running
$ make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile test
the following error occurs:
In file included from ./tensorflow/lite/core/api/op_resolver.h:20,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          from ./tensorflow/lite/micro/micro_interpreter.h:20,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       from tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/person_detection_experimental/person_detection_test.cc:23:                                                                                                                                                                             ./tensorflow/lite/schema/schema_generated.h: In function ‘const char* tflite::EnumNameTensorType(tflite::TensorType)’:                                                                                                                                                                      ./tensorflow/lite/schema/schema_generated.h:416:20: error: ‘IsOutRange’ is not a member of ‘flatbuffers’                                                                                                                                                                                           
This is because IsOutRange is not available in flatbuffer v1.11.0, which is currently downloaded by the make system. If I replace the flatbuffers directory in  with version 1.12.0 of flatbuffer source from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases/tag/v1.12.0&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it compiles fine.
Except for the test_micro_features_generator_test which fails due to not being able to find kiss_fft.h.
Please provide the exact sequence of commands/steps when you ran into the problem
$ make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile test
