	<summary>Typo in "Validate Your Installation" document.</summary>

Partway down:

If you are new to TensorFlow, see [Getting Started with TensorFlow]Getting Started With TensorFlow.

Note the extraneous square brackets; looks like a markdown typo. Interestingly, the "Getting Started With" link still works (which did not survive my copy-paste into the issue tracker).

		I've fixed this internally but it will take a bit to propagate out to the site.  Thanks for reporting.

		This doesn't look to have propagated yet; did you mean to close this before the fix landed?

		Hey, it has propagated out now, although now we have a separate bug in the page (an unclosed bold).
