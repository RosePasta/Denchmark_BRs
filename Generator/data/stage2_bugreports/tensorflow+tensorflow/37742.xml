	<summary>Add more ops in tflite</summary>
	<description>
System information

Windows 10
TensorFlow 2.0

Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If those are native TensorFlow operators, you might be able to use the extended runtime by passing --enable_select_tf_ops, or by setting target_ops=TFLITE_BUILTINS,SELECT_TF_OPS when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Otherwise, if you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Here is a list of builtin operators you are using: ADD, AVERAGE_POOL_2D, CONV_2D, DEPTHWISE_CONV_2D, FULLY_CONNECTED, MUL, SUB. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: IdentityN.

		Here's the code for the same:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf

# Load the MobileNet tf.keras model.
model = "C:/Users/Kaiwalya/Desktop/sign_language/new/saved_model.pb"

# Convert the model.
converter = lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		We are already at the size limit for our pips, so this will need to wait a while until lite can be separated from TF

		Any alternative to this? Anything else that i can do?
Thank you.

		Assigning &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jdduke&gt;@jdduke&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from TF Lite. I guess if the ops don't take much space we can take them, but letting TF Lite provide guidance

		Can you try with the latest TF nightly build? Or TF 2.2? IdentityN should be supported now.
