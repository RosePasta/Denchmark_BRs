System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0-beta1
Python version: 3.6.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
when creating tf.keras.Model with functional api, dilated convolution of tf.keras.layers can't estimate the output shape.
Describe the expected behavior
the dilated convolution can estimate the output shape as convolution op does.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
import tensorflow as tf

input= tf.keras.Input([100,100,3])
results = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters = 10, kernel_size = (3,3), padding = 'same', dilation_rate = 2)(input)
print(results.shape)
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
