	<summary>The call method of DenseFeatures and SequenceFeatures use deprecated attribute _num_buckets</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.13.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): from pip install
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-3259-gf59745a381 2.0.0-beta0
Python version: v3.6.7:6ec5cf24b7, Oct 20 2018, 03:02:14

Describe the current behavior
By simply calling the call method of DenseFeatures and SequenceFeatures defined with categorical_column_with_identity and sequence_categorical_column_with_identity feature columns (along with embedding_column), we get warnings that the deprecated attributes _num_buckets are used (instead of the non-deprecated num_buckets I guess).
Also note, on the code example below, that a third warning about a deprecated method, add_dispatch_support.&lt;locals&gt;.wrapper arises. I do not understand it but there are instructions for updating given in the warning, see the code below.
Describe the expected behavior
I think that we should not get warnings about deprecated objects when we are not calling any deprecated method, attribute, etc. I think that somewhere in the code of the call method of DenseFeatures and SequenceFeatures there is a use of _num_buckets that should be replaced by num_buckets. Following the updating instructions about the third warning may be enough to get rid of it.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.feature_column import categorical_column_with_identity, embedding_column, \
                                            sequence_categorical_column_with_identity
from tensorflow.keras.layers import DenseFeatures
from tensorflow.keras.experimental import SequenceFeatures

#print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)

nb_features = 10
emb_dim = 3

fc = categorical_column_with_identity('feature1', nb_features)
emb_fc = embedding_column(fc, emb_dim)
layer = DenseFeatures(emb_fc)

seq_fc = sequence_categorical_column_with_identity('feature2', nb_features)
emb_seq_fc = embedding_column(seq_fc, emb_dim)
seq_layer = SequenceFeatures(emb_seq_fc)

data1 = np.array(range(nb_features))
batch_size, sequence_length = 2, 5
raw_data2 = np.array(range(nb_features))
data2 = np.reshape(raw_data2, (batch_size, sequence_length))

dict_data = {'feature1': data1, 'feature2': data2}
print(layer(dict_data))
print(seq_layer(dict_data))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

produces the following three warnings:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING: Logging before flag parsing goes to stderr.

		The warnings are still here in tf2.0.0-rc0.

		Actually there is even one new warning when using tf2.0.0-rc0, I didn't see it the first time I tested. For the same code as above, now the output is:

Is it possible to re-open this issue? Or should I open a new one?
Edit: it says I unassigned &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bananabowl&gt;@bananabowl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but I don't know how to do that, I just posted this new comment and then edited it.
Edit 2: mentioning &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martinwicke&gt;@martinwicke&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as he is the author of the commit which caused this issue to be closed.

		All warnings have disappeared in tf2.0.0. This one can stay closed for good.
