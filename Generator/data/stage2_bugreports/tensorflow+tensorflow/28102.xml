	<summary>The Keras examples should load data with allow_pickle=True</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No, I was trying the tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS High Sierra 10.13.5
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.13.1
Python version: 3.6.2
Numpy version: 1.16.3

Describe the current behavior
When I tried the following code from the basic_text_classification sample:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(train_data, train_labels), (test_data, test_labels) = imdb.load_data(num_words=10000)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It failed with error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/datasets/imdb.py", line 86, in load_data
    x_train, labels_train = f['x_train'], f['y_train']
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py", line 262, in __getitem__
    pickle_kwargs=self.pickle_kwargs)
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/format.py", line 692, in read_array
    raise ValueError("Object arrays cannot be loaded when "
ValueError: Object arrays cannot be loaded when allow_pickle=False
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

According to the change of numpy in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13359&gt;numpy/numpy#13359&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the default value of allow_pickle was changed from True to False.
Please update the sample code accordingly (may pass in allow_pickle=True explicitly to np.load).
Describe the expected behavior
The basic_text_classification example could be followed without error.
Other info / logs
When I downgrade numpy from 1.16.3 to 1.16.1 (whose default value was still allow_pickle=True), I could finish the basic_text_classification example successfully.

		You need to use np.load(path) with the new parameters np.load(path, allow_pickle), where allow_pickle is a boolean.
This is a recent change in numpy which appears to be for improved source integrity. I encountered the same error as you listed, updating the method call in the respective .py files solves it.
In your case, find imdb.py and change np.load(path) in line 86 to np.load(path, allow_pickle=True)

Good suggestion, I could make this change in my local environment first.
I still suggest the official code could be updated thus other developers could avoid the issue.

@vamcily Think the issue has been fixed in 79a8d5c

Nice!  Which release would include this fix?

		hi,there i use the solution,before i solved it my numpy version is 1.16.3 and then
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Downgrate numpy to fix a problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

!pip install numpy==1.16.2
import numpy as np
print(np.version)
it fixed my problem the same as yours!
best luck!

This method does work, however, I meet the same problem as yours.
If you are using Jupyter Notebook ,you need to  restart Jupyter Notebook after some changes made in local package file. Running code like "from keras.datasets import imdb" again is useless.
The interesting point is that, in Jupyter, the codes showed as part of errors are real-time when the loaded files are not , then it may make us confused.

hi,there i use the solution,before i solved it my numpy version is 1.16.3 and then
Downgrate numpy to fix a problem
!pip install numpy==1.16.2
import numpy as np
print(np.version)
it fixed my problem the same as yours!
best luck!

that finally solved for me, I downgraded numpy version from 1.16.3 to 1.16.1 which default value is still allow_pickle=True.
just remove current version then install the 1.16.1 version via:
pip uninstall numpy
pip install --upgrade numpy==1.16.1
enjoy

		I am still getting the same error in Google Colab
I tried both
pip uninstall numpy
pip install --upgrade numpy==1.16.1
and
!pip install numpy==1.16.2
import numpy as np
print(np.version)
also but still not working, for Google Colab, do we need to do something extra.
(x_train,y_train),(x_valid,y_valid) = imdb.load_data(num_words=n_unique_words)
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/numpy/lib/format.py in read_array(fp, allow_pickle, pickle_kwargs)

--&gt; 692         try:
693             array = pickle.load(fp, **pickle_kwargs)

		Did you restart your runtime after installing numpy 1.16.2? (Click
"Runtime" menu, then "Restart runtime".)

		yes I restarted the runtime.
For full code, I created a notebook in Github.
Below is the link

np.load = lambda *a, **k: np_load_old(*a, allow_pickle=True, **k)
