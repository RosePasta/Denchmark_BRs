	<summary>tf.nn.conv2d_transpose with the same inputs produces different outputs on different calls on GPU</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: None
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.10.1-0-g4dcfddc
Python version: Python 3.6.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.16.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10
CUDA/cuDNN version: V9.0.176/7.1.4.18
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 12GB memory

Describe the current behavior
tf.nn.conv2d_transpose with the same inputs produces different outputs on different calls on GPU.
Describe the expected behavior
tf.nn.conv2d_transpose with the same inputs is expected to produce the same outputs on different calls on GPU.
Code to reproduce the issue
The code below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
tf.enable_eager_execution()


x = tf.random_uniform([1, 1024, 32, 32])
filter = tf.random_uniform([4, 4, 96, 1024])

y1 = tf.nn.conv2d_transpose(x, filter, [1, 96, 64, 64], strides=[1, 1, 2, 2], padding='SAME', data_format='NCHW')
y2 = tf.nn.conv2d_transpose(x, filter, [1, 96, 64, 64], strides=[1, 1, 2, 2], padding='SAME', data_format='NCHW')

# show difference between y1 and y2
print(tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y1 - y2)))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

produces a non-zero result like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tf.Tensor(8.213489e-06, shape=(), dtype=float32)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
tf.nn.conv2d_transpose with the same inputs produces the same outputs on different calls on CPU.

 Assigning to you since you were working on a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/11882&gt;similar issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 earlier. I have tested the above snippet in TF 1.12 and it still persists. Thanks!

		This is not a good match for me. Probably some GPU CudNN expert. Maybe reedwm?

 Can you please take a look at this issue? Thanks!

		This is likely due to the fact  is non-deterministic on the GPU. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ekelsen&gt;@ekelsen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you confirm?

		Yes, I believe it can be non-deterministic.  But the auto-tuner is also non-deterministic.  So basically all bets are always off right now.

 I think it was resolved. As mentioned above, non-deterministic nature of some ops results in minutely different results for the same input on GPU. Please close the issue if it was resolved. Thanks!
