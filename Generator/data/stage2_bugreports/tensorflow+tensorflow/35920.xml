	<summary>TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): from pip (binary?)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1
Python version: 3.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: no
GPU model and memory: no

Describe the current behavior and code to reproduce
I am running this code:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/cossio/dc761b2731b1428267b65333dbd3f321&gt;https://gist.github.com/cossio/dc761b2731b1428267b65333dbd3f321&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

to train an RBM by contrastive divergence. Briefly I am using the Keras sub-classing API and I view the multiple Monte Carlo samples as layers.
However it produces the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Please find the full error message and stack-trace as a comment on the above gist link.

		If I am reading your code correctly, you have:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;class CD(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, rbm, mcsteps = 5, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(self, **kwargs)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Whereas the super() call should be formatted like so:
super(CD, self).__init__()
You can of course add kwargs, if you wanted to.
As an example, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cvae#network_architecture&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for taking a look.
I get the same error using super().__init__(args) in all my custom classes.
Note that  is equivalent to . See &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#super&gt;https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#super&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 So you think this is a Tensorflow bug and not something wrong in my code? If you have suggestions for a workaround please let me know.

 Sorry for the delay in my response. I ran your code with  and everything worked well. I can see the deprecation warning as you mentioned. Other than deprecation warning, I cannot reproduce the error you mentioned. May be the error might have been resolved with recent . Here is the full trace of the output.

		Great! Will this be available in the next minor version of tensorflow? When is it planned to be released? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jvishnuvardhan&gt;@jvishnuvardhan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 This will be available in near future in  stable version. Currently TF team released  and in near future they may release  stable version.
Please close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!

 Well I cannot test for now because I only use TF stable. I will test when 2.2 is released. Thanks!

		I am closing this as this was resolved in tf-nightly and will be available in stable TF2.2 which will be release in near future (currently TF2.2rc3 released more than a week ago).
Please feel free to reopen if this persists in TF2.2 stable. Thanks!
