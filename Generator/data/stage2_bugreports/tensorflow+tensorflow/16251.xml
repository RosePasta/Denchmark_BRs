	<summary>Tensorflow Lite (tf-nightly) toco error for python3</summary>
	<description>
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS High Sierra 10.13.2
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): yes
TensorFlow version (use command below):  1.6.0-dev20180119
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:-
GPU model and memory: -
Exact command to reproduce: toco --help

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm following the current tensorflow codelab &lt;denchmark-link:https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-tflite/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#3&gt;https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2-tflite/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 however it seems that toco doesn't run under a python 3.6 env according to the output of the terminal
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

command input/output :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;└─[$] &lt;git:(master)&gt; toco --help

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

using sudo also doesn't help. There is also a stackoverflow issue logged here:

		Did you tried sudo chmod a+rw /path/to/folder/that/you/want/to/write/to  ?
Also, the stack overflow link which you pointed out also addresses variety of cases where some files might be locked by anaconda or may be trying specific versions for anaconda and python.
Also,please review guidelines before raising an issue !

		Could you give us the output  of running
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ls /Users/macuser/Projects/Tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/aux-bin/toco
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And then
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;chmod a+rx /Users/macuser/Projects/Tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/aux-bin/toco
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and try again.

  Thanks - this worked..
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ls -al /Users/macuser/Projects/Tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/aux-bin/toco
-rw-r--r--  1 macuser  staff  1413296 Jan 19 22:15 /Users/macuser/Projects/Tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/aux-bin/toco
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

i ran the above permissions command and this worked.

 - thanks - however i'm not using anaconda. Majority of the users from SO were addressing windows issues so was a bit lost there.

 I misunderstood the env. as anaconda env. I am glad you found a fix!
