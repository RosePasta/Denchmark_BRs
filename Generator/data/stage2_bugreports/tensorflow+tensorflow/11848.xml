	<summary>Can't import graph containing batch_sequences_with_states</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Mint 18
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary (pip)
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.3.0.0rc0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As I'm working with sequences I make extensive use of tf.contrib.training.batch_seq_with_states. I need to be able to load my graph afterwards so I write out a meta graph file containing a graph definition using Saver.save. Upon loading using tf.train.import_meta_graph I get an error hinting the batch_seq_with_states operation isn't saved in the graph:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(Pdb) tf.train.import_meta_graph('model.ckpt-1.meta')
*** KeyError: "The name 'input/batch_seq_with_states/InputQueueingStateSaver/' refers to an Operation not in the graph."
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Using Tensorboard I can inspect input/batch_seq_with_states/InputQueueingStateSaver just fine from the same files.
I will for now try to work around this by writing out a separate graph that relies on placeholders for data loading instead of batch_seq_with_states and then load the weights separate.

		I don't see any batch_seq_with_states, only contrib.training.batch_sequences_with_states, which is documented &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/contrib.training/splitting_sequence_inputs_into_minibatches_with_state_saving&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		So it is but the name used is without the leading module I believe. The documentation says nothing about it not being serializable.
You're right, I got confused. The name I supply to batch_sequences_with_states is batch_seq_with_states:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;                batch = self._batch_sequences_with_states(
                        input_sequences= input_sequences,
                        input_key      = context['key'],
                        input_context  = context,
                        initial_states = initial_states,
                        input_length   = context['num_frames'],
                        num_unroll     = self.time_steps,
                        batch_size     = self.batch_size,
                        num_threads    = 2,
                        capacity       = self.batch_size * 4,
                        name           = 'batch_seq_with_states',
                        make_keys_unique = True,
                        allow_small_batch = True # Required otherwise blocks
                        )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The issue looks very similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/11888&gt;#11888&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Is this still a problem?

		Yes, it is, but it's a niche problem with some niche Tensorflow functionality so it shouldn't affect too many people. I've moved on.
