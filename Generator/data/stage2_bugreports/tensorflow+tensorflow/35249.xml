	<summary>Wrong Accuracy value for Training data in tutorial...</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Under "Train the model" in "Build the model", the accuracy of the model on training data after 10 epochs is 0.91(91%) while it is mentioned as 0.88(88%).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since, it is already mentioned in the tutorials that the model overfits the training data, thus the accuracy on training data should be more than that on testing data(88.3%).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If this issue is alright, I'll be glad the submit a PR right away...
Thanks for the help!

		Perhaps we may update the statement to This model reaches an accuracy of about 0.91 (or 91%) on the training data in the Train the model cell.

		I'm sorry but I didn't get you clearly, Are you saying that we should add
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
and
As the model trains, the loss and accuracy metrics are displayed. This model reaches an accuracy of about 0.91 (or 91%) on the training data.
to the cell Train the model above??

		Looks like we have 89% accuracy for 5 epochs while for 10 epochs, accuracy is 91%
So, i think instead changing the epochs, changing accuracy is fine...
This is what I've done in this PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/pull/1311&gt;tensorflow/docs#1311&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can someone plz check it out.
