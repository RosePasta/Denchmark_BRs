 I am unable to reproduce the issue on colab with Tensorflow 2.0.0.beta0. Please help us to reproduce the issue. When i ran it throws ```
FATAL Flags parsing error: Unknown command line flag 'f'
Pass --helpshort or --helpfull to see help on flags.
An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.
SystemExit: 1

Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gadagashwini&gt;@gadagashwini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 There's no  flag defined anywhere in the code I gave. Try copy/pasting this and try out.
python3 image_retraining_tpu.py --tpu [TPU_NAME] \
--use_tpu --use_compat --data_dir gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data_dir \
--model_dir gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/model_dir --batch_size=32 \
--iterations=8 --max_steps=8
I'm not sure about colab, I've been trying this on gcloud. So, it would be better if you can try out on a VM instance.
