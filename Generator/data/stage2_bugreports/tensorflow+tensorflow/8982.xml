	<summary>log_device_placement not working in some cases</summary>
	<description>
Hey guys, thank you for working on TensorFlow so hard!
I think I found a small bug, but it might be so that I just don't understand ConfigProto correctly.
So:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;config = tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)
server = tf.train.Server.create_local_server()
with tf.Session(server.target, config=config):
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

outputs the device placement correctly, but
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;config = tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)
server = tf.train.Server.create_local_server(config=config)
with tf.Session(server.target):
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

doesn't (at all).
While this is not groundbreaking, just wanted to let you know.
Cheers, Kris

		That indeed seems to be at least a discrepancy between the documentation of tf.train.Server and the behavior.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/suharshs&gt;@suharshs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 : Mind taking a look? It seems that  in Python ends up sending a  RPC with  based on the options provided the  constructor. This means that the default provided to  was ignored. Which might be okay? But perhaps something needs to be cleaned up (either we don't have a "default" for the server, or we use it?)

		The docs for tf.train.Server say:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;config: (Options.) A `tf.ConfigProto` that specifies default
        configuration options for all sessions that run on this server.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This doesn't seem to match the code in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_server_lib.cc&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_server_lib.cc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It looks like the ServerDef (which has the session_opts) passed in isn't even passed to the MasterSession, unless I am missing something.
We need to somehow merge the session_opts in ServerDef with the ones passed to MasterSession before creating it. I'll look into this.
Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/krisjobs&gt;@krisjobs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
