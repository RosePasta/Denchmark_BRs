	<summary>tf.pad docstring is missing description of the "mode" argument</summary>
	<description>
The docstring gives examples of using "CONSTANT", "REFLECT" and "SYMMETRIC" modes, but never describes what they actually are.
For example:

What value is used to pad in constant mode? (The answer is 0.)
What exactly is the difference between REFLECT and SYMMETRIC? (I don't know.)

		Cool, thanks for the report.  &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html&gt;http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is I think where we get these names from -- do you want to send us a PR to fix this?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py#L922&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py#L922&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 would be where to add the documentation.
