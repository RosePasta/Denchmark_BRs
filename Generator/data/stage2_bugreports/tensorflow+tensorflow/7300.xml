	<summary>API documentation "Core graph data structures"</summary>
	<description>
A few things are wrong in the documentation around &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/framework.md#tfgraphadd_to_collectionname-value-graphadd_to_collection&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

Near the end of tf.Graph.name_scope, the line about ValueError is incomplete.
The paragraph at the very end of tf.Graph.name_scope should be in tf.Graph.add_to_collection.
Both tf.Graph.add_to_collection and tf.Graph.add_to_collections (plural) exist.

		Sorry. Please use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/framework.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/api_docs/python/framework.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 then scroll down to the end of tf.Graph.name_scope .

		I'm submitting a fix for the broken docstring in tf.Graph.name_scope().
The bad formatting between  and the paragraph describing collections is (I believe) a function of the doc generator, which &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/josh11b&gt;@josh11b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 touched last and will be best placed to fix.
I don't know what the problem is about having tf.Graph.add_to_collection() and tf.Graph.add_to_collections(), other than it seems a bit redundant. Regardless, we're stuck with supporting both of those methods because of the 1.0 API freeze.

		I'm closing this, as the formatting and paragraph whatnot is fixed on this new page:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Graph#name_scope&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Graph#name_scope&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please re-open or re-file if I'm missing something.
