Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Bug example:
x = tf.constant([1, 4])
y = tf.constant([2, 5])
z = tf.constant([3, 6])
tf.parallel_stack([x, y, z])
Work example
x = tf.constant([1, 4])
y = tf.constant([2, 5])
z = tf.constant([3, 6])
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(tf.parallel_stack([x, y, z])))
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

I was able to reproduce the issue reported here, but the 'working example' too seems to throw an error. Please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/07cc20c8528e0f6209800732ec5aa297/41493.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If possible could you please provide a working example too? Thanks!

		I have a similar issue but with "Moving average".
ValueError: Moving average not supported in eager mode.

 should have fixed the issue. Parallel Stack has no eager implementation and we now raise an error.
