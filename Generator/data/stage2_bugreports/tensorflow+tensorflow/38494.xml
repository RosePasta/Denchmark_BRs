@zijiaozeng
can you please share the code and error log faced

I can't find any error log in my background inference processes, it occurred by accident (very rare), there is a core_python_xxx file size 3 GB I can provide.

		Recommend switching to 1.15 or later. If you need to use 1.12, please make sure you use the latest patch available, since we have fixed several security vulnerabilities that could produce core dumps.

		If switching has solved the issue, can we close this?
If it didn't, can't you post the new error log? Maybe even some code you're running so we can attempt to reproduce and fix?

Okay, I will try it in the next few days,  if it doesn't work, I'll post detail information include code snippet when located the specific scene where the problem occurs.  Howeverï¼Œno exceptions thrown when the program crash.
