	<summary>l2_normalize broken in master</summary>
	<description>
tf.nn.l2_normalize(tf.constant(np.ones([2, 2, 2, 2])), [0, 1, 2]) crashes with the following error:
ValueError: Shape (1, 3) must have rank at most 1
The problem is that l2_normalize function converts the dimension list into [[0, 1, 2]] (double brackets) and it stopped being supported recently. It works fine in 0.10 branch as far as I can tell.
Shorter repro to get the same error:
tf.reduce_sum(tf.constant(np.ones([2, 2, 2, 2])), [[0, 1, 2]])

		Thanks, the bug is in l2_normalize.
tf.reduce_sum is working correctly, the dims argument must be a scalar or a vector.  I'll work on a fix + test
The change that broke this was that reduce_sum was not checking its shape contract, and now it is.
