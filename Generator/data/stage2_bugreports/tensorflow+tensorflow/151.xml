	<summary>Typo in reshape documentation</summary>
	<description>
Small typo at
&lt;denchmark-link:http://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/array_ops.md#AUTOGENERATED-shapes-and-shaping&gt;http://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/array_ops.md#AUTOGENERATED-shapes-and-shaping&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Under the reshape example it says:

tensor 't' is [[[1, 1], [2, 2]]
[[3, 3], [4, 4]]]
tensor 't' has shape [2, 2]

But I think t initially has the shape [2, 2, 2] not [2, 2].
