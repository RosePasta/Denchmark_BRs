	<summary>Use HParams for "learning rate" hyper-parameter tuning</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/hyperparameter_tuning_with_hparams&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/hyperparameter_tuning_with_hparams&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the documentation it's nowhere written how to tune learning rate hyper-parameter for different optimisation algorithms. Plus the code in file python3.6/site-packages/tensorboard/plugins/hparams/summary_v2.py says,
if dtype not in (int, float, bool, str): --&gt; 482       raise ValueError("Unknown dtype: %r" % (dtype,))
I am trying to create HParam list
hp_optimizer = hp.HParam('optimizer', hp.Discrete([optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), optimizers.Adamax(learning_rate=0.001), optimizers.Adamax(learning_rate=0.0001), optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01), optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.001)]))
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

How should someone tune learning rate?

Will it be possible to provide minimal stand alone code to reproduce the issue. It helps us in localizing the issue faster.Thanks!

		There's no functionality asfaik to do the tuning for you. This is just a dashboard so you can compare different runs with different hparams to see which is best in tensorboard.
I have a GridSearch/RandomSearch function in my code that just loops over parameters and runs a new experiment. Just a more automated fashion of running different trials.
As for your error, you are passing in an instance of Adam as an hparam, only numbers/strings are allowed. If you want learning rate to be displayed in the Hparams tab then you should pass in just learning rate. I personally add optimizer as a string and then learning rate as a float.
Your link as plenty of examples of all of this

		I am able to use float as the learning rate, and using it to create an optimizer. Thanks for the help.

Could you please give more details on adding optimizer as a string and learning rate as a float?I am not able to experiment with different learning rates on HParams. Here is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/3688&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to my issue.
