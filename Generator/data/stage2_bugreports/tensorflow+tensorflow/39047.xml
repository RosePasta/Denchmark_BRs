	<summary>Docstring is not misleading.</summary>
	<description>
The docstring says " it is a negative quantity between -1 and 0, where 0 indicates orthogonality and values closer to -1 indicate greater similarity". Although it is true that the function reverses the sign of the classic cosine similarity so that -1 will denote "similarity" instead of 1 in the original formula, the actual range is still -1 to 1 (not -1 to 0 as misleading by the docstring).
