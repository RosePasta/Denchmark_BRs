	<summary>TF2.1 cannot save model trained by distribution strategy while TF2.0 could do</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Ubuntu 16.04


TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below):
TF2.1 and TF2.0


Python version: - Bazel
version (if compiling from source):
From source


CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:
CUDA 10.1


You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
The model trained under distribution strategy could not be saved in TF2.1 while it could be saved in TF2.0.
Describe the expected behavior

The exapmle code I copy from another issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36477&gt;issue &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
import tensorflow as tf

def build_and_compile_model():
    
    input = tf.keras.Input((20,))
    x = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(input)
    y = tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
    
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input, outputs=y)
    
    model.compile(
        loss=tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy,
        optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.001),
        metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    return model

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = build_and_compile_model()
model.save('test', save_format='tf')
 Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		@JiayuanSternLi,
Could you please check if it works with the latest nightly version and let us know if it works? Thanks!
