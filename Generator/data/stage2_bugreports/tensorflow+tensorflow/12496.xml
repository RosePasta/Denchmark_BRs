, we should fix this. Could you please reassign appropriately? Thanks!

 I suppose we were wrong about that cert being unused. Are we ready to move or should we renew what we have?

		Not for tensorflow.org, I got a new one for &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org&gt;www.tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We may need to discuss what exactly needs to be done here.

		Perhaps use &lt;denchmark-link:https://letsencrypt.org/&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? Free and wildcarded.
Edit: apparently full wildcard support is not available until the end of February; regardless, their existing certificate can be issued for base.domain + &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.base.domain&gt;www.base.domain&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which satisfies this case. It's also very simple to get running - &lt;denchmark-link:https://certbot.eff.org/&gt;certbot&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will do everything for you.

		Could this certificate be applied to *.tensorflow.org as well? &lt;denchmark-link:https://playground.tensorflow.org/&gt;https://playground.tensorflow.org/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 provides a certificate error.

		Playground is served from github pages, which doesn't support cname forwards combined with SSL (a common problem). &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dsmilkov&gt;@dsmilkov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I think it's worth finding an alternative for this (GAE?) Come July the pure http will be &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/08/google_chrome_http_shame/&gt;effectively inaccessible in Chrome&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		Makes sense. Migrating playground to https is long overdue. We are going to use GAE on another project very soon, so I'll do it then.

		I recently went to China and was using tensorflow.google.cn back there to circumvent the GFW. Upon coming back to the US, I am no longer able to open tensorflow.org on either safari or chrome, but tensorflow.google.cn continues to work.
On safari, I simply get "too many redirects occurred trying to open ..." message
On chrome, I get a "Your connection is not private" message, but if I proceed anyway to the unsafe address, I would get "This page isnâ€™t working
&lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org&gt;www.tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 redirected you too many times.", similar to safari.
I have double checked that my datetime is set correctly to PDT (automatically synced). I have tried clearing all cache, browser history, cookies, etc to no effect. Help is greatly appreciated!

		Below is the certificate warning statement. My colleagues are able to access tensorflow.org without problem. I suspect it has to do with my diligent updating of MacOS and browsers, that brought about heightened SSL security?
This server could not prove that it is &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org&gt;www.tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
; its security certificate expired 387 days ago. This may be caused by a misconfiguration or an attacker intercepting your connection. Your computer's clock is currently set to Saturday, July 21, 2018. Does that look right? If not, you should correct your system's clock and then refresh this page.
