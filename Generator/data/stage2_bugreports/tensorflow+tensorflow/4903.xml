	<summary>tensorboard command broken</summary>
	<description>
Running tensorboard results in this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    logdir = os.path.expanduser(FLAGS.logdir)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'logdir'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Best practice in this case is arg(opt)parse.

		I had this issue, had to run the tensorboard.py script directly instead of through bin/tensorboard. FLAGS is set in the new if-main block.

 could you please take a look? It seems this was caused by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8018346e12f9fef76cdc7accc248de17514f6d38&gt;8018346&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		How are you providing args to the script in the first place if you're not executing it as main? If you aren't providing args, why is the expected behavior for FLAGS to be not be None?

		I'm running tensorboard --logdir='/tmp/tflearn_logs'
Anyway, expected behaviour is 'logdir flag is missing', not crash.

		Hmm I don't see any reason for this in the source. FYI tensorboard does now use argparse. In fact this is the change (from tf.flags to argparse) that was responsible for this regression. I'm going to try to independently verify this behavior.
EDIT: for discoverability I would suggest changing the title to something like: "tensorboard.FLAGS is None-type even when run as script"
EDIT2: Famous last words, there is in fact an obvious reason for this, pointed out by the above poster. I suspect after build bin/tensorboard actually calls out to: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/__main__.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/__main__.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which obviously wouldn't execute the main block of tensorboard.py... Argparse switch was made in bulk by a script which is why this wasn't caught. I'll get working on a fix.

 When pip installs TensorFlow it creates a  .sh file. See the setup.py.
CONSOLE_SCRIPTS = [
    'tensorboard = tensorflow.tensorboard.tensorboard:main',
]
Which creates a script like this:
#!/Users/jart/tensorflow/bin/python

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import re
import sys

from tensorflow.tensorboard.tensorboard import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(main())

		Even after rollback &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/39d0932c8796802a15663d3b59f559ab36244ece&gt;39d0932&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this issue most likely still exists &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/elibixby&gt;@elibixby&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, due to the fact that the if name == main doesn't get evaluated when the pip generated script calls it.

		I'm on the end of the master branch and am having the same problem reported by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ror6ax&gt;@ror6ax&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think the changes made in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/39d0932c8796802a15663d3b59f559ab36244ece&gt;39d0932&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 were undone by the automated rollback in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c23870e57c70f0c3da1dee93d083447e0fa3f56&gt;7c23870&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		meet same issue, use python /home/zido/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py --logdir=xxxxxx is ok.

		Same issue here, directly using
(tensorboard)$ python tensorboard.py --help is working,
also note that
(tensorflow)$ /_python_build/tensorflow/tensorboard$ ./tensorboard --help is working
but
$ tensorboard --help is not working

File "/usr/local/bin/tensorboard", line 11, in 
load_entry_point('tensorflow', 'console_scripts', 'tensorboard')()
File "/home/zeng/essential/tensorflow/_python_build/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py", line 44, in main
logdir = os.path.expanduser(FLAGS.logdir)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'logdir'

looks like it's the symbolic link doesn't read arguments.
note that in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py#L47&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py#L47&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

it directly run main function which doesn't run the argument parser in if ==""
system: ubuntu14.04
installment: master, build from source

 's pull-request should fix. The command-line  call the  so all the code of initialization should be in that function.
Thanks for contribution.

		Please see my comment on the pull request. I'm going to revert the argparse changes to tensorboard, and have opened an internal issue to fix the underlying problems to allow us to move cleanly to argparse, while supporting both internal and external users.

		The rollback has been made internally, and should be pushed out shortly.

		Clarification: The push is manual, so the soonest the fix will be available here is Monday, sometime in the afternoon if there are no failures with the push.
Thanks for the fix!
