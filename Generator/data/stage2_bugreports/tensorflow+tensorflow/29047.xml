	<summary>one 404 page needs to be fixed</summary>
	<description>
At the beginning of sub title &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/overview#train_from_tfdata_datasets&gt;Train from tf.data datasets&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there is a super link pointing to .
But when you click it out, only 404 page is what you get.
Since this API is very often been used, it would be better to correct this as soon as possible.
