	<summary>NewCheckpointReader does not work for the V2 checkpoint format</summary>
	<description>
Unable to read the new checkpoints (V2 format) that became default from r0.12 release using NewCheckpointReader. This breaks the TF slim API, specifically:



tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/variables.py


         Line 487
      in
      c2d14aa






 reader = pywrap_tensorflow.NewCheckpointReader(model_path) 





&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/discuss/3AalcBJ-6z8&gt;https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/discuss/3AalcBJ-6z8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I started that thread and was suggested to post an issue here
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System: CentOS 6.6
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
(please attach the output of ls -l /path/to/cuda/lib/libcud*): CUDA 8, cuDNN 5
If installed from binary pip package, provide:

A link to the pip package you installed:
The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)". 0.12.0-rc0

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import tensorflow as tf

w1 = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal(shape=[10]), name='w1')
saver = tf.train.Saver()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
saver.save(sess, 'my-model')

reader = tf.train.NewCheckpointReader('my-model.index')  ## error
print reader.get_variable_to_shape_map()
The error is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):

		I also notice that the recommanded script &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/inspect_checkpoint.py&gt;inspect_checkpoint.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is not working anymore since the r0.12 release of Tensorflow.

 would you reassign as necessary?

		You can use  instead.
With V2 saver format, the reader is not expecting a file name, but only the prefix of the filename. (Frankly I don't like this feature very much..because filename auto-completion doesn't help anymore
The  is necessary because of a bug &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4921&gt;#4921&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ppwwyyxx&gt;@ppwwyyxx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said, you just need to use "my-model" without ".index". Please let me know if that fixes the problem for you. Thanks.

		Yes, that seems to fix the problem. Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ppwwyyxx&gt;@ppwwyyxx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Dot-slash workaround does not work for checkpoints that re not in the current directory. Neither /path/to/./my-model  nor ./path/to/my-model.
Is there a workaround for that one? ;)
P.S. tested with the latest as of now commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fe70bd9c22357741e69751bdf189726c440db02e&gt;fe70bd9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 at r0.12 branch

 I thought you don't need this workaround for checkpoints that are not in .
Are you suggesting that simply using  doesn't work? What is the error?

 Indeed. Sorry, I screwed up the path. False alarm. Full path seems to be working now.
