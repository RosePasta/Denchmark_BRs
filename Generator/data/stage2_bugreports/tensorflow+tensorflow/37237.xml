	<summary>steps_per_epoch not propagating to Keras callbacks in tf-nightly</summary>
	<description>
This behavior was tested in tf-nightly==2.2.0.dev20200302 on macOS.
Some of our Keras callbacks rely on accessing self.params['steps'] in order to take actions based on how far along the process is into the current epoch (e.g., learning rate schedule).  However, it appears that this param is no longer being set properly, even when mode.fit(steps_per_epoch=...) is called.
I did some digging, and it looks like the issue can be traced to the way  is being set &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L753&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  The  object is an instance of , which is initialized with the  param and assigns it to , but the  method always returns  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/data_adapter.py#L704&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Is there a workaround for this?  Ideally, we'd like for callbacks to have access to the steps_per_epoch information without having to pass it in to each callback manually.
You can see an example of how we use this in Horovod in the LearningRateWarmupCallback from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/master/examples/tensorflow2_keras_mnist.py#L77&gt;tensorflow2_keras_mnist.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 example.  As you can see in the implementation of that callback &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/cff4de331edcd6cabbd807b7010e7432b03fe2b7/horovod/_keras/callbacks.py#L108&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we are attempting to access , which used to get set correctly prior to v2.2.

 Yes this should be fixed in the latest nightly
Also have a cherrypick out for the 2.2 release branch: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/37314&gt;#37314&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
