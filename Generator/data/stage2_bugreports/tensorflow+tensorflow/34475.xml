Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
Hi there, i want to use the StagingArea structure by using 'from tensorflow.contrib.staging import StagingArea' in old version. How could i use it in tf2, and i see the definition is here :tensorflow/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py
Describe the expected behavior
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

In Tensorflow 2.0 the you can import StagingArea as follows

You can refer to the following &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1cf0898dd4331baf93fe77205550f2c2e6c90ee5/tensorflow/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py#L1769&gt;line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi there,
do you know which function or class could be used to change the StagingArea
in tf2?

Currently, i want to use tf.Variable in tf2 not placeholder to be put in
stagingarea like this:

self.staging_tf = StagingArea(
dtypes=[tf.float32 for _ in self.stage_shapes.keys()],
shapes=list(self.stage_shapes.values()))

self.buffer_ph_tf = [tf.Variable(tf.ones(shape=shape)) for shape in
self.stage_shapes.values()
# tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=shape) for shape in
self.stage_shapes.values()
]
self.stage_op = self.staging_tf.put(self.buffer_ph_tf)

batch = self.staging_tf.get()

it comes error:
  File "/home/robertmu/baselines/baselines/her/ddpg.py", line 345, in
_create_network
    batch = self.staging_tf.get()
  File
"/home/robertmu/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py",
line 1924, in get
    return self.__internal_get(fn, name)
  File
"/home/robertmu/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py",
line 1890, in __internal_get
    return self._get_return_value(ret, indices)
  File
"/home/robertmu/miniconda3/envs/tf2/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py",
line 1740, in _get_return_value
    tensors = self._create_device_transfers(tensors)
  File

line 1717, in _create_device_transfers
    curr_device_scope = control_flow_ops.no_op().device
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'device

 Please post this question in stack overflow as github is only meant for issues related to bug/performance, build/install, feature requests and bugs. Thanks!
