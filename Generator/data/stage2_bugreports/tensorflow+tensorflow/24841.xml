	<summary>Fix support for newer bazel versions - Issue 23673 closed with incorrect solution.</summary>
	<description>
I believe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/23673&gt;#23673&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was closed incorrectly.
The problem is newer versions of bazel are not reading the bazel.rc that provides:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tools/bazel.rc:build --define=grpc_no_ares=true
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The solution can not be to install ares as this option is supposed to disable the need for it.
Please fix the build process to support newer versions of bazel (in my case, using 0.19.0)
