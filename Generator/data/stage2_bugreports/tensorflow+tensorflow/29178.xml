	<summary>[TF2] Variable List Shape</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip install tf-nightly-2.0-preview
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-2995-ge09b015 2.0.0-dev20190530
Python version: 3.8

Describe the current behavior
Right now, the tf.Variable constructor accepts a list as a shape -- but if you do this, then calls to .assign raise an error.
Describe the expected behavior
Either tf.Variable should automatically convert the list to a tf.TensorShape (or it could raise a type error for a list shape, but that seems significantly less ergonomic).
Code to reproduce the issue
The following code:
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([50, 50]), shape=[None, 50])
x.assign(tf.zeros([10, 50]))
fails with:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "a.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    x.assign(tf.zeros([10, 50]))
  File "/opt/anaconda/envs/tf2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/resource_variable_ops.py", line 1145, in assign
    self._shape.assert_is_compatible_with(value_tensor.shape)
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'assert_is_compatible_with'
If I use shape=tf.TensorShape([None, 50]) then this works just fine.

		Have tried with TensorFlow version 2.0.0-dev20190531 on Colab and was able to reproduce the issue.

 Hi, I've tried this on tensorflow 2.1 and tf-nightly and haven't got this issue. Can you please check on your end?

, This is fixed in Tf-nightly==2.2.0.dev20200312.
Please find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/gadagashwini/39f97b21499f862848df44f6f24f680d/untitled445.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and let us know can we close this issue. Thanks
