	<summary>tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions does not work at all</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.4-rc1
Python version: 3.7

Describe the current behavior
The implementation of tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions tries to use some trickery (for unknown reason) and fails to do anything in its constructor. See 


tensorflow/tensorflow/python/distribute/collective_util.py


         Line 84
      in
      bd3a525






 return Options.__new__(Options, *args, **kwargs) 




 and 


tensorflow/tensorflow/python/distribute/collective_util.py


         Line 114
      in
      bd3a525






 pass 





This makes it impossible to use the non-deprecated tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy and specify the communication backend as that requires to create such an options instance
Describe the expected behavior
Creating an instance of that class initializes the members
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions(bytes_per_pack=-1) # This should fail!
communication = tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation.NCCL
o = tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions(implementation=communication)
assert o.implementation == communication # Error: no attribute 'implementation'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
IMO this is critical for the 2.4 release and the fix is rather simple: Don't have an extra Options class but simply put that code into _OptionsExported and let Hints derive from that. To not disturb other (internal) code renaming _OptionsExported to Options would be wise.

		It's to separate internal APIs and external APIs (e.g. the merge() method).  A fix is in the pipeline and will be cherrypicked.
