	<summary>pb:tensorflow-gpu with cuda 7.5 and cudnn 4 is faster then tensorflow-gpu cuda8 and cudnn 6</summary>
	<description>
I tested tensorflow 0.8 with cuda 7.5 and cudnn 4 (Maxwell Quadro K620), execution time=0.075s when i test the same code with cuda 8 and cudnn 5 , execution time=0.75 s
I tested the some code with tensorflow 1.3 , cuda 8 ,cudnn 6 ,jetpack 3.1 (jetson tx2) , execution time =0.6s when i try to get the timeline with chromium::/tracing i added tensorflow.python.client import timeline that use libcputi , execution time become =0.3s ,the code run on gpu , because when i run it in cpu execution time become 0.9 s.
the code uses face detection with cnn.
i don't understand why the code is faster when i use tensorflow with cuda 7.5 and cudnn4 then cuda 8 and cudnn 5 or 6 . any help please?

		There are all sorts of reasons that when code changes that some things get faster and some things get slower. Without a reproducible test case, we can only speculate. Unless you can provide a reproducible case and post it, there is no way we can look into this.
