	<summary>Eager Execution basics lacks definition of eager execution</summary>
	<description>
Does the page &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/eager/eager_basics&gt;Eager Execution basics&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 have the right title? It hardly touches on eager execution, might be better named Tensor Basics.

 Here is a better source for &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager&gt;eager execution&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. This page does touch upon how to enable eager execution and some tensors basics, but some of the materials are not very relevant. We will note this down.
