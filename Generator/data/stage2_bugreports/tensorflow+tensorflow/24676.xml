	<summary>NNAPI doesn't support tensors with rank 0 - LeakyRelu?</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Linux Ubuntu 16.04 + Android 8.1
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Anaconda
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source): tensorflow 1.12.0 + keras 2.2.4 for converting model using tflite_convert and tensorflow-lite:1.12.0 in Android gradle build config

Provide the text output from tflite_convert
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(update_36) m@m-hp:~/repos/keras_ocr_preproc$ tflite_convert --output_file=android/some_name.tflite --keras_model_file=android/some_name.hdf5

WARNING:tensorflow:No training configuration found in save file: the model was *not* compiled. Compile it manually.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

..which sounds OK.
Any other info / logs
Log from Android 8.1, tensorflow-lite 1.12.0 device: Alcatel 1 dual sim:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;E/tflite: NNAPI doesn't support tensors with rank 0 (index 16 name class_2/LeakyRelu/alpha)
    Returning error since TFLite returned failure nnapi_delegate.cc:742.
    Failed to build graph for NNAPI
E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: DefaultFallbackThread
    Process: eu.yesse.readerdemo.release, PID: 27460
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Internal error: Failed to run on the given Interpreter: @
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It crashes only when setUseNNAPI is set to true (I know - usage is deprecated in tflite:1.12.0).
When setUseNNAPI is commented, it seems that fallback to CPU happens and everything works, but slow.
Also for other Androids &lt;=8.0, it works extremaly slow comparing to evaluation of the same model on iOS devices using CoreML.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aselle&gt;@aselle&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , since NNAPI is only available on devices with Android 8.1 or later (by setUseNNAPI), and the fallback is on CPU implementation on older devices, for this user the TFLite throws an error on tensors with rank 0. Can you please advise. Thanks.

		As far as I understand NNAPI does not support LeakyRelu only Relu Relu1 and Relu6.
See operator mapping

NNAPI documentation also does not list it. &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/neural-networks&gt;https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/neural-networks&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		hello guys，I met the same case but my error log is：
2019-02-27 16:37:37.125 29351-29398/? E/tflite: NNAPI doesn't support tensors with rank 0 (index 13 name inference/generator/add_1/y)

2019-02-27 16:37:37.125 29351-29398/? E/tflite: Failed to build graph for NNAPI
the op with  tanh as activation and  *0.53+0.5. besides,my relu funtion is self-define leaky_relu,then it
's maxmum in the graph

		This should be supported now, can you give it another try?
