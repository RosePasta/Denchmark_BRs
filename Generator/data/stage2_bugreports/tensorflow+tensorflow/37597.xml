	<summary>TF Lite OpenCL Input Tensors Same Address</summary>
	<description>
This is already fixed in master (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8685cf97d568855f3e7cf194d7e370bb71c51c73#diff-49796db7c3f71b9c25c7837d9ee16abf&gt;8685cf9#diff-49796db7c3f71b9c25c7837d9ee16abf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), however I thought it's appropriate to report it nonetheless if anyone else encounters it.
Before the fix, the inputs of a model with three or more inputs were not copied correctly because some of them shared the same memory address in the context of OpenCL.
