Describe the documentation issue
As newbie to Tensorflow it quite confusing seeing that you need to bazel build something, all I had to do before this point is pip install. To be more specific, what is bazel? Why do I need it to use GTT? Why is GTT not available from pip installation? Why when I'm going to Build from source page it encourages me that you providing pre-built packages, where is GTT then?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andrhua&gt;@andrhua&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we tend to make binaries available for things with stable api's, that we want to encourage the use of. There's no binary for this and it's never mentioned on tensorflow.org, which likely puts it in the category of internal details that regular users shouldn't rely-on.
Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/suharshs&gt;@suharshs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, you're more familiar with the graph-transformation landscape. Do you know what the future holds for this tool?

		Hi, super sorry for the delay.
GTT is a legacy tool and its not being directly supported anymore. Grappler should be used instead. That is the reason its not exposed via pip.
Thanks!
