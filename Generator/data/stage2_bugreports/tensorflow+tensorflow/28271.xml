Describe the problem
The following command described in the README located in tensorflow\lite\experimental\micro\examples\micro_speech loops for ever:
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile test_micro_speech
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem
I have followed the sequence described in the README:

make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile test_micro_speech

Any other info / logs
The reason is a "while true" in the source micro_speech
but the makefile should run micro_speech_test instead, so i think that the issue is in the makefile but i don't understant this makefile.

		Hi Robot,
Is this still an issue? In my recent test, I don't seem to be able to reproduce it.

		I think we recently fixed this, so closing, but reopen if you see a recurrence.
