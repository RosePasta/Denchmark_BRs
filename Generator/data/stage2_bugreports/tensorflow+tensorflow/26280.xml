	<summary>Bug in TensorflowLite Android Example</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: Oneplus 5T
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.1.0-rc0-61-g1ec6ed5 1.1.0
Python version: 3.6.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: -

Currently, the tensorflow lite example uses dp for textsize attribute for android example. As per definition, this is a bug. The dp has to be changed to sp, as per Android standards.
