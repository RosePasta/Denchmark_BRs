&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I can't find a clear statement whether or not the regularization layers (noise, dropout) are bypassed when the validation data is processed (to calculate the validation loss) when calling  provided with validation data. I can see that in the source code of the Dropout Layer that it is branched based on the  argument of . &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.1.0/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/core.py#L181&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.1.0/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/core.py#L181&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But it is completely unclear to me whether or not the validation pass is considered "training" or not. After all, I'm calling the "fit" function.

, first of all validation pass is not considered as training and during training of network actually dropout layer is not bypassed instead of that all neuron's weight of dropout layer is multiplied by probability p of its existence.

		So, based on your statement "validation pass is not considered as training", all types of noise and dropout do not affect validation loss computations.

		Yes validation pass is not considered as training and dropout layer doesn't affect validation loss.
