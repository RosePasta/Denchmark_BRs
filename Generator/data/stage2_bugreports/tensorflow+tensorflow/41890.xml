Describe the current behavior
Epoch 1/5
WARNING:tensorflow:AutoGraph could not transform &lt;function Model.make_train_function..train_function at 0x0000013933B3A798&gt; and will run it as-is.
Please report this to the TensorFlow team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10) and attach the full output.
Cause: 'arguments' object has no attribute 'posonlyargs'
To silence this warning, decorate the function with @tf.autograph.experimental.do_not_convert

Describe the expected behavior
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0
model = keras.Sequential([
keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(0.1),
loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train,y_train,epochs=5,batch_size=256)
and now it`s happen

I ran the shared code and do not face any warnings,please find &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/89f7c21c1ee3b3fcb6f45e2c1c7b3cf8/untitled305.ipynb&gt;gist here for 2.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/580d82953532a58f3e8db7cee73c2315/untitled305.ipynb&gt;2.3 as reported&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
You can safely ignore the warning log as its intended to debug logging in AutoGraph issues. Thanks !
You may refer to resolved issues with same error:

		This looks like a gast version mismatch. If the issue still reproduces in tf-nightly, please re-open the bug. Thanks!
