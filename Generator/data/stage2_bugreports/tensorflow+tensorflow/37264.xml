System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.14.137+ x86_64)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.1.0-0-ge5bf8de410
Python version: 3.6.9 (default, Nov  7 2019, 10:44:02)


According to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/name_scope&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/name_scope&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

If the scope name already exists, the name will be made unique by appending _n. For example, calling my_op the second time will generate MyOp_1/a, etc.

However, it turned out to be not. Nor did I manage to find any code (inside tf.name_scope) that might generate the uniqueness.
import tensorflow as tf
layer = tf.keras.Input(shape = [None])
def get_shape(layer):
  with tf.name_scope('scope') as scope:
    return tf.shape(layer, name=scope)
get_shape(layer)
get_shape(layer)
The first get_shape(layer):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;tf.Tensor 'scope:0' shape=(2,) dtype=int32&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The second get_shape(layer):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):

I have tried to replicate your issue and observe that the error is reproducible even for single use of get_shape,please refer to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/9096209a8e0752e0bb96d08a727635e7/37264.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and let us know if that helps.
please refer to this link for &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/shape?hl=sv&gt;usage of shape&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The reason why you may observe the error even after the first use - you already launched the script and haven't noticed that. You should reset the notebook. The 'scope' is in the graph and will not go away on its own.

please refer to this link for usage of shape

Thanks, but my point is to demonstrate that the tf.name_scope doesn't work as documented. tf.shape has nothing to do with that. It's just for an example. You may try print(scope.name)

		This is fixed with tf-nightly version '2.2.0-dev20200309'. Thanks!
