It was moved out of tensorflow GitHub repository to a new repository on GitHub. Link to the new repository is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/issues&gt;here.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Please file an issue there so that it will be resolved faster. You could also raise a PR to update the docs in that repository. Thanks!
