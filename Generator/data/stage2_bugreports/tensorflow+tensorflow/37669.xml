	<summary>Scatter nd add has legacy docstrings from scatter nd</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/tensor_scatter_nd_add&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/tensor_scatter_nd_add&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

These sentences:

indices is an integer tensor containing indices into a new tensor of shape shape. The last dimension of indices can be at most the rank of shape:

Seem to be direct copy-paste from the docs of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/scatter_nd&gt;scatter_nd&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, there is no  args in .
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The docs should instead refer to tensor.shape.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Correct links&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is the link to the source code correct? There is no link (that's another issue though I guess), only to the tf v1
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Parameters defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are all parameters defined and formatted correctly? Yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Returns defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are return values defined? Yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Raises listed and defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are the errors defined? No errors raised apparently
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Usage example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is there a usage example? Yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Request visuals, if applicable&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are there currently visuals? If not, will it clarify the content? No, but there are some in scatter_nd, I guess it's enough
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are you planning to also submit a pull request to fix the issue? See the docs

 , can you explain the issue using example and elaborate it ? The given description is not enough to clearly understand the issue. Thanks!

		Well it's a doc issue so it's not really fit for an example. I just meant that the docs for tensor_scatter_nd_add should not mention a shape argument that is not part of the arguments of tensor_scatter_nd_add.

		Thanks for the quick reply &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zaccharieramzi&gt;@zaccharieramzi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Are you able to locate the file where  is implemented? If Yes, then please also provide the link. I am not able to locate the method.

		Like I pointed in the issue there is no link to the source code in the docs (that's another problem I guess). I think it's because it's a C++ op.
However, I don't understand why you would need it to understand this particular issue.
Anyway, I think the function is implemented here: 


tensorflow/tensorflow/compiler/tf2xla/kernels/scatter_nd_op.cc


         Line 172
      in
      5214758






 class TensorScatterAddOp : public XlaOpKernel {

 , I have found the code with the doc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/java/blob/master/tensorflow-core/tensorflow-core-api/src/gen/java/org/tensorflow/op/core/TensorScatterNdAdd.java&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
