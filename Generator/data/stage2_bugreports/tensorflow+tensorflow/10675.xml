	<summary>Inner tf.device inherits device index when using wildcard index</summary>
	<description>
TF version: v1.2.0-rc0-735-gf48673b (about one week ago)
with tf.device('gpu:7'):
    with tf.device('cpu:*'):
        print(tf.constant(0).device) # /device:CPU:7
workaround:
with tf.device('gpu:7'):
    with tf.device(None), tf.device('cpu:*'):
        print(tf.constant(0).device) # /device:CPU:*

		Yes, this looks like a bug. There's no distinction in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/device.py#L24&gt;DeviceSpec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 class between  and "not present", which are both represented using  for the  property.
The resulting behavior is not very intuitive, and it would be nice to fix this, but I'm not sure how heavily * is used in device strings, and it's possible that fixing it could break existing users.

 would you decide if this is worth fixing?

 Would it make sense to consider this fix as part of the  changes in 2.0?

		This is a stale issue. Please check the issue with latest TensorFlow. If the issue still persists in the newer version of TF, please feel free to reopen it by providing details about the issue and a standalone code to reproduce the issue. Thanks!
