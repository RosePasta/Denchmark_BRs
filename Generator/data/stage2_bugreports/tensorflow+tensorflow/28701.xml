	<summary>Possible wrong comments in minimax_discriminator_loss</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

One line 468:     # -log((1 - label_smoothing) - sigmoid(D(x)))
Shouldn't it be -(1-label_smoothing) * log(sigmoid(D(x)) ?
I'm uncertain about the label_smoothing part, but I think the argument of the log is wrong.
On line 477: # -log(- sigmoid(D(G(x))))
Shouldn't it be -log(1-sigmoid(D(G(x))?

		Yes I think you're right. The comment is inconsistent with the function-level description, which is correct. Do you want to change it? Please not that tf.contrib will be going away in future version of tensorflow, so it probably makes more sense to change it in tensorflow_gan here and here. Do you want to send me a CL to fix this?

Feel free to ignore the label smoothing in the description; it would make more sense to just match the terms in the function-level description.
