You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow_datasets.core.features' has no attribute 'text'
Describe the expected behavior

Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
the code is that, run it in the google colab, Can you tell me the reason?
tokenizer = tfds.features.text.Tokenizer()
vocabulary_set = set()
for text_tensor, _ in all_labeled_data:
some_tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text_tensor.numpy())
vocabulary_set.update(some_tokens)
vocab_size = len(vocabulary_set)
