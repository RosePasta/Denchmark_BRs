Utility maybe a different library.

		Hi, sorry but this is not a tensorflow issue. In your example, utility is some kind of third-party package, or home-made library, not a part of tensorflow, as is clear from your import syntax.

This question is better asked on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged//tensorflow&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it is not a bug or feature request. There is also a larger community that reads questions there.
Hence moving this issue to resolved status.
