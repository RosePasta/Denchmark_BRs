	<summary>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'gfile' in 0.7.0 [Fixed in source, will be in next binary release]</summary>
	<description>
I'm on an Ubuntu machine, installed tensorflow and ran the image processing example as in the website but it failed complaining about gFile not found,
Here's the exception stack:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "classify_image.py", line 213, in &lt;module&gt;
        tf.app.run()

        sys.exit(main(sys.argv))

		My guess is that you are running source code from HEAD with a pip install from 0.6.0.  Either check out the code at the same branch / tag as the pip install, or compile from sources at HEAD to use code at head.

		Let me check that, thanks for looking into it.

		I had the same problem executing the file classify_image.py. Changing the branch to 0.6.0 solved this problem. Thanks!

Yes, using r0.7.0, and run
$ cd tensorflow/models/image/mnist
$ python convolutional.py
will have this problem.
When changing to 0.6.0, no this problem.

		So the temporary fix for this is to use 0.6.0 for TensorFlow?

		Try upgrading to 0.7.1
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip uninstall protobuf
pip install path/to/0.7.1.wheel

		It works fine on 0.8

		Was with this error to run ptb_word_lm.py in the old version.
Really, after upgrading worked properly
thanks!
