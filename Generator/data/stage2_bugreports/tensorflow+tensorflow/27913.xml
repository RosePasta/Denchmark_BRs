System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.13
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:7.0/9.0
GPU model and memory: 1080ti

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the current behavior
project deeplab v3 +.When I open the memory, the network input is a pointer to mat, not a pointer to the raw file I opened, so the input is wrong. And remove the pointer input of mat, although the input pointer is correct,  the content read by tensor is wrong, resulting in the final output map is all 2 (label).This may be related to defining the location of the tensor.
Describe the expected behavior
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

 I think it is related to TF models repo. Could you post it in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues&gt;model repo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If you think the issue is more related to TF Core then share a reproducible code or a GitHub gist to reproduce the issue? It will help us to resolve the issue.
Thanks!
