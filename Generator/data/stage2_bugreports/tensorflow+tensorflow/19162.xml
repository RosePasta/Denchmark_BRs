	<summary>Documentation of raw_rnn is wrong</summary>
	<description>
In the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/raw_rnn&gt;official documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of tf.nn.raw_rnn we have emit structure as the third output of loop_fn when the loop_fn is run for the first time
later on the emit_structure is used to copy tf.zeros_like(emit_structure) to the minibatch entries that are finished by emit = tf.where(finished, tf.zeros_like(emit_structure), emit)
my lack of understanding is: emit structure is None so tf.where(finished, tf.zeros_like(emit_structure), emit) is going to throw a ValueError as tf.zeros_like(None) does so. Can somebody please fill in what i am missing here?
basically even the example implementation of dynamic_rnn using raw_rnn is simple wrong
to quote exact parts:
in dynamic_rnn implementation shown
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def loop_fn(time, cell_output, cell_state, loop_state):
  emit_output = cell_output  # == None for time == 0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and in raw_rnn we have:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;time = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)
(finished, next_input, initial_state, emit_structure, loop_state) = loop_fn(
    time=time, cell_output=None, cell_state=None, loop_state=None)
.
.
.
# Emit zeros and copy forward state for minibatch entries that are finished.
  state = tf.where(finished, state, next_state)
  emit = tf.where(finished, tf.zeros_like(emit_structure), emit)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This will fail at the first time step itself. But i have gone through code, this is not how it is implemented. In case of None for emit_structure  cell_output is used.
raw_rnn is really powerful and once i have understood it there is no going back to dynamic_rnn or any other rnn unfolding mechanism. But the documentation is making is really tough to understand this amazing api. An improvement is in order

		OK, are you able to write a better documentation?

		It has been 14 days with no activity and the awaiting response label was assigned. Is this still an issue?
