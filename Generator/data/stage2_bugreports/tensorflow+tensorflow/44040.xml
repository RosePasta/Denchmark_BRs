cuDNN 8 is not supported. Please try installing cuDNN 7.6 and check if you are facing the same issue?
Thanks!

 Apologies for the delay in response. I see you are using GeForce GTX 960M which has 5.0 cuda compute capability.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus&gt;https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

As of now we have TensorFlow pip pre built packages that support CUDAÂ® architectures 3.5, 3.7, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0 and higher than 7.0
Unfortunately your gpu is not among the supported pip packages.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#hardware_requirements&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#hardware_requirements&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Solution here will be to build a pip package from source that supports your gpu architecture.
Thanks!
