	<summary>tf.compat.v2.summary should be used in /guide/eager#summaries_and_tensorboard</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager#summaries_and_tensorboard&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager#summaries_and_tensorboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We should not recommend the usage of tf.contrib.summary in eager mode.
tf.compat.v2.summary (or tf.summary in TF2) should be used in this section.
With , we need to use  or  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32587&gt;#32587&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) to record events even in eager mode. This is very unnatural and confusing.
When I read this section, I thought record_summaries_every_n_global_steps() is optional and spent a lot of time to notice why tf.contrib.summary.scalar operations in my code was no-op.
In eager mode, I think we should recommend code like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;for i in range(num_steps):
  loss = train_one_step()
  step = i + 1
  if step % 100 == 0:
    tf_summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

with tf.compat.v2.summary.

		I noticed the section about Tensorboard and summary was deleted in  branch by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/commit/b1658ccbdd86e19251c5fd58ce962e78437e95ff#diff-32b6b3f97f424a88c5360b84619e5257&gt;this commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Does this means we will not explain about tf.summary in eager.md after TF2 launch?

		Anyway, I sent a PR to  branch: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/pull/1044&gt;tensorflow/docs#1044&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you take a look into it?

		According to the discussion of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/pull/1044&gt;tensorflow/docs#1044&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it seems like that the live site won't be updated until TF2 launch.
I'm not very happy about the fact that TensoFlow guide aren't updated for a while though many people are interested to learn TF2.0. But I understand TF team is busy for TF2 releases.
I'm closing this bug because I added a tf.summary section to the new TF2 tutorial and we can not fix this issue on the site until TF2 release.
