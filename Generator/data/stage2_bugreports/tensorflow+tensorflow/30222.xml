2019-06-28 15:22:19.791510: E tensorflow/lite/toco/toco_tooling.cc:462] We are continually in the process of adding support to TensorFlow Lite for more ops. It would be helpful if you could inform us of how this conversion went by opening a github issue at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new?template=40-tflite-op-request.md
 and pasting the following:

Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime and are not recognized by TensorFlow. 
If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). 
Here is a list of builtin operators you are using: ABS, ADD, CONCATENATION, CONV_2D, DIV, EXPAND_DIMS, FULLY_CONNECTED, GREATER, LEAKY_RELU, MAXIMUM, MEAN, MINIMUM, MUL, NEG, POW, RESHAPE, RESIZE_BILINEAR, SUB, TANH. 
Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: SelectV2.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Any other info / logs
At the beginning, I tried to convert without this "magic" line:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS, tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And I got almost the same error log, BUT it was additional operation that couldn't be converted. I attached the end of that log:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: Reciprocal, SelectV2.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As far as understood correctly, tf.where doesn't work and it is related to SelectV2, because when I remove line with tf.where(x &gt; 0, left, right) everthing is okay. It's strange, because TFLite docs said that tf.where should work.
Also, I figured out that Reciprocal is linked to 1.0 / x expression.

		Current workaround for tf.where:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def where(bools, first, second):
    first *= tf.cast(bools, tf.float32)
    second *= tf.cast(tf.logical_not(bools), tf.float32)
    return first + second
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Current workaround for Reciprocal:
Find every 1.0 / x expression and replace it. In my case, I had (x - y) * (1.0 - (1.0 / (a - b)) and I replace it with (x  - y) * (a - b - 1.0) / (a - b).
I suppose error happened because TF is looking for 1.0 / x and optimize it in some another way rather than simple x / y. Need to fix.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Oktai15&gt;@Oktai15&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we're investigating direct converter support for reciprocal, stay tuned for updates.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Oktai15&gt;@Oktai15&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, now the direct support for reciprocal is ready. FYI, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/df41bbafb50e1ea99404257cf7fa6f60bd063b5f&gt;df41bba&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		SelectV2 op is now available in Tensorflow Lite.
