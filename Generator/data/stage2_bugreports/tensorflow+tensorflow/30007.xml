	<summary>Tensorflow Lite Micro fails to build for embedded targets due to dependencing on gemmlowp</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version: 420473f
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): arm-none-eabi-g++ 7.3.1

Describe the problem
Building Tensorflow Lite Micro fails when building for the bluepill target, due to an unmet dependency.
The problem seems to be caused by the fact that tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/common.h includes tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/optimized/cpu_check.h.
tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/common.h is in turn included by the kernels in Tensorflow Lite Micro.
This adds gemmlowp as a dependency, which causes Tensorflow Lite Micro to not build when building for eg Cortex-M3 in the bluepill case.
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem
$ make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=bluepill test
Any other info / logs

		just verified &amp; ditto for TARGET=arduino (trying to compile for cortex m4 in arduino using the mock_speech generator)
... ok verified simple comment-out fix works and now runs - time to get some microphones :)

		Pete's recent commit should have solved this problem. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/97123eff9496776d31cac2131ad65f07e9614f95&gt;97123ef&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/petewarden&gt;@petewarden&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! I'll try this out and add to our Arduino-ready library &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TFLite_Micro_Speech&gt;https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TFLite_Micro_Speech&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - we got it &lt;denchmark-link:https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/06/24/tiny-machine-learning-on-the-edge-with-tensorflow-lite-running-on-samd51-arduino-tensorflow-tinyml-tensorflow/&gt;working really nicely on a Cortex M4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here's a video of it in action :)
