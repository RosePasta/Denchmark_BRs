	<summary>Only one GPU is used during .fit() validation phase</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0

Describe the current behavior
During validation phase of Keras' .fit(), only one GPU is used (while all GPUs are used during the training phase).

This issue can be easily reproduced using the code of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/keras&gt;this official tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, by feeding the validation dataset  to .

		How did you determine if was using only one GPU during validation? Can you also share more information about your setup? This is using MirroredStrategy?

 I used  to observe GPU usage, only one GPU is used during the entire validation phase of . Training was launched on 4 GPUs using .
Not sure if it's related to this issue on Keras' repo: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/9404&gt;keras-team/keras#9404&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		from device placement logs it seems that validation happens on all GPUs under conditions mentioned in  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/9404&gt;keras-team/keras#9404&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (num_data=7,num_gpu=3,batch_size=6).
nvidia-smi may not be accurate if the dataset is small. Could you try again with a larger validation set (by adding a .repeat(N) to the dataset).
