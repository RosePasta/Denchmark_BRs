	<summary>tf.data.Dataset - You must feed a value for placeholder tensor</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (also tested in Windows 10 obtaining the same behaviour)
TensorFlow installed from: pypi, pip install tf-nightly
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.4.0-dev20200718
Python version: 3.6.9

2020-07-23 09:58:13.497096: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:48] Successfully opened dynamic library libcudart.so.10.1
v1.12.1-36900-g829256e314 2.4.0-dev20200718
Describe the current behavior
Computations involving tf.data.Dataset stall.
If the dataset is small the execution continues properly but the error is still registered in the server logs.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Excerpt from: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import pathlib
dataset_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz"
data_dir = tf.keras.utils.get_file(origin=dataset_url, 
                                   fname='flower_photos', 
                                   untar=True)
data_dir = pathlib.Path(data_dir)
list_ds = tf.data.Dataset.list_files(str(data_dir/'*/*'), shuffle=False)
# Triggers the abort message
for f in list_ds.take(5):
    print(f.numpy()) 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can you please refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40521295/invalid-argument-you-must-feed-a-value-for-placeholder-tensor-with-dtype-float&gt;this link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and let us know if it helps.
I ran your code on nightly and do not face any error, please refer to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/5c23ca410e27dc9635e844d1278b0f37/untitled284.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for having a look.
Yes, I found the discussion you refer to in the link while trying to solve the issue, but the minimal code I posted doesn't use any feed_dict.
Regarding your collab gist. The error message is logged on the server-side, I have experienced it with a Jupyter lab server both in Linux and Windows. On the client-side (the notebook) no error is logged (as seen from your colab gist). I have no idea if there is a way of reading the server-side log in colab or if there is a way of redirecting that error output to the notebook. So there is no way to know if the error is happening in colab too.
The minimal code I posted is enough to consistently generate the error message in two of my systems but doesn't produce the stalling behaviour.  As I mentioned, with small enough computations seems like the abort "signal" is triggered after the computation finished with no effect, i.e. no stalling. I believe that the error message should be enough to track down the error.

After further inspection, the error does get logged in colab's server-side too (using your gist).

		I just upgraded my computer so I had to install a new system now my own code I used to have it worked with no issues started giving me this error message today. Not sure why!!!!

		I found this issue only happens if you are using tf-nightly. Switching to tensorflow 2.3 resolved the issue

Agreed, I can get the warning to pop up with the replication instructions and this nightly:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!pip install tf-nightly==2.4.0.dev20200722
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But not with the current nightly, or with the stable release, so whatever this problem was it seems to have been fixed.
