Looks like this issue is a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/8736&gt;#8736&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can we close this issue since it is already being tracked in the models repo? Thanks!

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/amahendrakar&gt;@amahendrakar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should be fixed too, which is not mentioned at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/8736&gt;#8736&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Similar issue has been raised &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/8698&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Also, seems like the tutorials page has been updated. There is no Object detection API under Images. Instead it has been replaced with Object detection with TF Hub.

Please check the above image and feel free to close the issue if resolved. Thanks!
