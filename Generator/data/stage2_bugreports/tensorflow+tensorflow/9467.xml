	<summary>Link Error for the deprecated/__init__.py</summary>
	<description>
It seems that the link "look '&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
'" can not point to the right page in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/deprecated/histogram_summary&gt;doc of histogram_summary&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, should we just change it to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

, can we add this to the fix it... I don't know if it is covered by another more general fix approach.

 I would like to work on the issue. How do I start?

 Just wonder how does &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 resolve the url, seems that it can resolve &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/summaries_test.py&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/summaries_test.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/summaries_test.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/summaries_test.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 successfully while failed for __init__.py. One possible reason is that the "_" is some kind of special character for the URL resolver. It's better for us to check this first, otherwise we can just simply change &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
