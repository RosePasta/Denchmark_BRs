	<summary>Deprecation warnings Model.state_updates and layer.updates when saving model</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colab Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): happens on 2.3.1 (v2.3.0-54-gfcc4b966f1) and 2.4.0-dev20201020 (v1.12.1-44160-g72c19e8880)
Python version: 3.6.9

Describe the current behavior
Getting two deprecation warnings when saving a model (with default parameters).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py:2334: UserWarning: `Model.state_updates` will be removed in a future version. This property should not be used in TensorFlow 2.0, as `updates` are applied automatically.
  warnings.warn('`Model.state_updates` will be removed in a future version. '
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer.py:1397: UserWarning: `layer.updates` will be removed in a future version. This property should not be used in TensorFlow 2.0, as `updates` are applied automatically.
  warnings.warn('`layer.updates` will be removed in a future version. '
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
No warnings!
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.Sequential([
  keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,)),
])

model.save('my_model')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I ran the code shared, these are just depreciation warnings, nothing to worry about they will not affect your performance..
To hide the warnings please refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/27023#issuecomment-475684266&gt;this comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and let us know.

		I know that they are "just" deprecation warnings, however calling non deprecated method save on model and getting these warnings is weird to say the least. It means that save calls deprecated functions somewhere, shouldn't it be corrected? These warnings are here exactly for this reason, to remind us to replace code with something else (or just remove calls as warnings suggest that it's called automatically now) instead of just silencing all warnings.
