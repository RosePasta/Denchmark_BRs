Hello :)
I am totally new at programming, and wanted some advice.
I want to create a program using the google maps api.
Is Python the adequate programming language to use?
Thanks in advance for your answer :)

		Hey inoxstasy, you are currently posting on a platform that is solely for issues related to the TensorFlow application and not at all meant for general programming questions like this. Try posting your question on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Good luck with your project.

		This question is better asked on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged//tensorflow&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it is not a bug or feature request. There is also a larger community that reads questions there.
Hence moving this to closed status.
