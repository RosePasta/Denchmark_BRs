	<summary>Update tensorboard development instructions</summary>
	<description>
I want to be able to run tensorboard in development mode and make some changes.
from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorboard/DEVELOPMENT.md&gt;DEVELOPMENT document:&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


bazel run third_party/tensorflow/tensorboard/components/tf_tensorboard:demo

but this command seems to be obsolete from the directory structure (there is no target inside /third_party).
also seems there is a .idea folder committed in the repository.
Would be nice to know how the core team setups their environment.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md#usage&gt;The README.md is currently up-to-date.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 We should, as you indicate, update . I'll just go ahead and do this in our new repository at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks for reporting.
As to development environments, it's just everyone's own taste; we don't have a single unified setup. In fact, we're all quite different: I believe we've got Linux with vim, Linux/Mac with Sublime, Linux on emacs/IntelliJ, and using a Google-internal web IDE. :-)
