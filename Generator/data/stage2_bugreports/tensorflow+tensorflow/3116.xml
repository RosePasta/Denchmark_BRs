	<summary>Getting an 0.8 .whl when installing from source from master branch</summary>
	<description>
I'm getting an 0.8 .whl when installing from source right now (current master [6-27]; Ubuntu 15.1; Python3.5). Am trying it from scratch again.

Checked the repo: README.md: # Release 0.9.0
cudnn 7.5, is that correct?
bazel version: 0.2.3

Output from ls -l /usr/local/cuda/lib64/cudn*:
Aug 15  2015 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudadevrt.a 16 Aug 15  2015 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so -&gt; libcudart.so.7.5 19 Aug 15  2015 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.7.5 -&gt; libcudart.so.7.5.18 383336 Aug 15  2015 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart.so.7.5.18 720192 Aug 15  2015 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudart_static.a 61453024 Jun 25 17:23 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so 61453024 Jun 25 17:23 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so.4 61453024 Jun 25 17:23 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so.4.0.7 62025862 Jun 25 17:23 /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn_static.a
And my primary question: what does the following mean:
Cudnn libraries, use '6.5' for R2, '7.0' for R3, and '4.0.4' for R4-RC.
That's about the only thing I can think of that could be causing me problems.

		Need 0.9 for the conv3d support

		I believe it's named 0.8 but it should have conv3d.  We haven't merged the version number changes from r0.9 back into master.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/caisq&gt;@caisq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Awesome, will check.  Would not have guessed that at all.

		Closing.  Hope this helps others.  That threw me for a loop.

		I think we should probably keep this open until we fix the issue

		I merged 0.9 into master earlier today.
