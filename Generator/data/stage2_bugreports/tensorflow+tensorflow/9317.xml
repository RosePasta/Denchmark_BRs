	<summary>Explain what tf.nn.softplus does to integers</summary>

 computes .  Naively, I wouldn't expect this to work for integers, but it does.  On integers, it seems to degenerate to a poorly named version of : it computes .
We probably can't eliminate the integer versions for backward compatibility reasons, but we should at least explain what they do.

		Hmm, there seems to be more of this in core/ops/nn_ops.cc.  E.g., softsign is the same.
I added it to the doc fixit spreadsheet.

		tf.nn.softsign on ints is rather less useful: it's the constant zero function.

: Maybe we should drop these?  Arguably they're just bugs.

		I'm a little reluctant to remove the functionality since that will break graphs (and code) that worked before. But a warning (deprecation?) would be nice.
