&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The current pip package that exists on PyPi is tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0rc2. The documentation says tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-rc1, which is 2 typos.
The command to install it is pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0rc2.
The documents say pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-rc1, which is two typos.
This bug has existed for all release candidates.

		Btw, both tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-rc2 and tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0rc2 works.
For that matter, even pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0----rc2 works.

		In my tests -rc2 did not work. Nor did previous release candidates. With the dash has never worked, there hasn’t been an asset with a dash on pypi. I listed the available pypi packages above, there is no dash.
I’m using pip with late model Anaconda Python 3/a conda environment.

		This is most likely an issue with the pip version.
On my system I am able to install both with dash and without dash
(dash) mihaimaruseac@ankh:/tmp/32751/dash$ pip install -q tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-rc2
(dash) mihaimaruseac@ankh:/tmp/32751/dash$ echo $?
0
(dash) mihaimaruseac@ankh:/tmp/32751/dash$ python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__path__)"
['/tmp/32751/dash/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow']

# change environment

(nodash) mihaimaruseac@ankh:/tmp/32751/nodash$ pip install -q tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0rc2
(nodash) mihaimaruseac@ankh:/tmp/32751/nodash$ echo $?

I am using pip 19.2.3 which seems to be the latest (pip install --upgrade pip doesn't bring anything new).
As such, closing the issue.

 I have the same pip version as you. That you can’t reproduce it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist - look at the versions available on the pypi page for tensorflow-gpu and you’ll see the one with the dashes is missing. This seems to be proof of the problem?
I pasted the versions available in the ticket, check them out.

 I have the latest version of pip and this is happening. Given that you know this is a bug, why have you closed this ticket? Shouldn't you leave it open until the bug in the parent library is resolved? You could also change the package name to remove.
I don't get how the above bug explains this having no dash:
See: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/2.0.0rc2/&gt;https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/2.0.0rc2/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I closed the bug because this is not an issue that tensorflow devs need to handle. Leaving it open will just drown out other issues that we should be working on. Afaik, it is standard to deduplicate issues and close those that are caused from upstream, favoring the upstream issue.

 Just so I understand you correctly, the reason pypi lists no package with a dash is because of this bug? And pip removes the dash automatically?
I just want to verify this is why &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/2.0.0rc2/&gt;https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/2.0.0rc2/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 works and &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/2.0.0-rc2/&gt;https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-gpu/2.0.0-rc2/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does not, it redirects.

		See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers&gt;the corresponding section in PEP 440&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#pre-releases&gt;examples in same PEP&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: there is no dash in the canonical name.
Regarding the PyPi website: the redirect that is being done is legit, rather than display the same content at two URLs one returns a 301 and redirects to the canonical URL.
Regarding the  expected behavior: see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#normalization&gt;normalization section in same PEP&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It explains why  should do the same as . If it doesn't, see the bug I linked above on PyPa.
