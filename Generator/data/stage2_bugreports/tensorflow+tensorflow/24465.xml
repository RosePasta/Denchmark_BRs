	<summary>Unexpected result for tf.sqrt under certain conditions</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Mojave 10.14.1
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.12.0
Python version: 3.6

Describe the current behavior
The output  of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/sqrt&gt;tf.sqrt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the provided snippet is incorrect. Concretely, when  is a &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable&gt;tf.Variable&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and  is run together with , the output  is .
Describe the expected behavior
The expected result is a_sqrt_2.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf

x = 100.0
a = tf.Variable(x)
# a = tf.constant(x)  # Interestingly, it works when `a` is a constant
a_sqrt = tf.sqrt(a)
a_scaled = a / a_sqrt


with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    a_sqrt_1, _ = sess.run([a_sqrt, a_scaled])
    print(a_sqrt_1)  # prints 0.1  (!!!)

    a_sqrt_2 = sess.run(a_sqrt)
    print(a_sqrt_2)  # prints 10.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 this looks like another case of fetches not being preserved by grappler. Can you take a look?

		Tested with nightly tensorflow, the code produces the correct output.
Similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/23196&gt;#23196&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
