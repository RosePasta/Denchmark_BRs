	<summary>Documentation: User-friendly Bazel installation</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a documentation issue. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:doc_template
System information

TensorFlow version: GPU 1.14.0
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows

Describe the documentation issue
The documentation for installing Bazel on Windows is separated into two different pages with no indication that the second page is required after following the first.  This can lead to install issues and build errors that make absolutely no sense, but do after figuring out that you're missing 5 dependencies, mentioned only on the second page under "Building C++ Projects"
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
I have written a massive walkthrough for installing tensorflow &lt;denchmark-link:http://aaronjencks.net/blog/8/#Bazel&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but in reality, just a mention of the second page as an indication that there's more to set up than just the "Install Bazel" &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-windows.html&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on the site, that the user must also install the dependencies for building C++ projects with Bazel, found &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/windows.html&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, would solve the issue.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/iggy12345&gt;@iggy12345&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for the report.
I don't have a windows box handy to try this on.
So help me understand.
The install_source_windows file includes in the setup section &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows#install_visual_c_build_tools_2015&gt;Install Visual C++ Build Tools 2015&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Isn't that what the "C++ with Bazel" page you linked to says?
Or is it just not clear in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows#setup_for_windows&gt;Setup&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that you need to do  these things?
Either way, you seem to have a clear idea of what's missing, if you want to propose a PR, here is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/install/source_windows.md&gt;source file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for that page.
