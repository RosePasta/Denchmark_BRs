	<summary>Missing Graph Editor Documentation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/graph_editor&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/graph_editor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.graph_editor&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.graph_editor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The Graph Editor API Doc (first link above) links to the Graph Editor Guide (second link above) which is a 404 error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The broken link to the Graph Editor Guide needs to either be fixed or removed and replaced with some actual, comprehensive documentation on using the Graph Editor. At the moment, there is no documentation on Graph Editor usage available anywhere.

 Out of curiosity, do you have any idea what happened to the original guide or where I could find it?

 Yep, some of the older /api_guides are archived here in tensorflow/docs (r1.11 branch): &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/r1.11/site/en/api_guides/python&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/r1.11/site/en/api_guides/python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Though, as you've found, there are still some links that need to be removed.
These guides mostly existed pre-moduleâ€”and now modules have their own overview pages in the API docs.
