	<summary>Malformatted doc page for SGD optimizer</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD#apply_gradients&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD#apply_gradients&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The formatting in the "References" section is wrong; there is a nesterov = True, that has nothing to do with the reference.

 I agree there is some formatting required in this page. But, can you please explain what do you meant by "that has nothing to do with the reference"?. I think the reference explain about the importance of . Thanks!

 I haven't read the reference, I just saw that this piece of code was no reference, and I couldn't find where it belongs to, so I assumed it should not be in the reference box.
Sorry for my ambiguous formulation.
