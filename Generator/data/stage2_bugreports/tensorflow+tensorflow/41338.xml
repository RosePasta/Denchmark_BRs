	<summary>Keras 2.4.3 does not calculate output shape in reshape layer</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Arch Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): conda
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: tested in both 3.7.6 and 3.8.3
I tested both with a non-gpu version and with cudnn 7.6.5 + cuda10.1_0

Describe the current behavior
Output length of a reshape layer with last element of length unknown is marked as None
Describe the expected behavior
In previous versions of Keras, it was calculated from the other input shapes
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
The following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import keras
layer = keras.layers.Reshape([5, -1])
k_input = keras.Input((5, 6, 4))
model = keras.Model(inputs = [k_input], outputs = layer(k_input))
model.summary()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

has different outputs depending on the version. In Keras 2.3.1 the last dimension of output is correctly deduced to be 24:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;_________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   
=================================================================
input_1 (InputLayer)         (None, 5, 6, 4)           0         
_________________________________________________________________
reshape_1 (Reshape)          (None, 5, 24)             0         
=================================================================
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In Keras 2.4.3 the last dimension of output is None
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; _________________________________________________________________
Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   
=================================================================
input_1 (InputLayer)         [(None, 5, 6, 4)]         0         
_________________________________________________________________
reshape (Reshape)            (None, 5, None)           0         
=================================================================
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Could you please try with tf.keras instead of just keras and let us know if it helps.
I ran the code on tf nightly and it works fine with tf.keras, please refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/e00caf45925842bc86c8628628ea4ee2/untitled268.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and confirm.

		With my conda installation with Keras 2.4.3, using tf.keras instead of keras still does not do the trick, I am afraid.
Please note that in the gist that you sent, tf.keras version is 2.4.0 (as shown by putting print(tf.keras.__version__) in the notebook), and thus earlier than the version I am having problems with (2.4.3), and the python version is also different (3.6.9 instead of 3.7.6/3.8.3)

		Is this still an issue? Can you try executing your code in a virtual environment?
Works fine with  2.4.3 as is see the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ymodak/b889199dd9bc61bbd3321b9543d1676f/github_issue_41338.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I also tried in my local with python 3.7.6 and keras 2.4.3.
See attached pycharm console screenshot.
