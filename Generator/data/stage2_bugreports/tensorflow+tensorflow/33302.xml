	<summary>Tflite coverter error. tensorflow/lite/toco/tooling_util.cc:935</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to convert a TensorFlow model to tflite model from a frozen graph.
I' getting an error saying I should make a bug report to tflite team.

**you can download the graph from HERE.**

any help would be much appreciated. 
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0
Python version: 3.7

Describe the current behavior
tensorflow/lite/toco/tooling_util.cc:935] Check failed: GetOpWithOutput(model, output_array) Specified output array "sample_sequence/while/Exit_3" is not produced by any op in this graph. Is it a typo? This should not happen. If you trigger this error please send a bug report (with code to reporduce this error), to the TensorFlow Lite team.

Describe the expected behavior
Code to reproduce the issue
**import tensorflow as tf

tflite_model = converter.convert()
open("converted_model_0.tflite", "wb").write(tflite_model)**

		have you found any reason, why it's happening?
let me know .

		An Exit op means that this graph has control flow. TensorFlow Lite doesn't support control flow generated by TensorFlow 1.X so this functionality is not expected to work. We are working on supporting control flow 2.0 so please regenerate your graph in 2.0 if you want to run it using TenosrFlow Lite.
