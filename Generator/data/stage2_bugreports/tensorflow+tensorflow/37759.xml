		From the template it looks like you are installing TensorFlow (TF) prebuilt binaries:

For TF-GPU - See point 1
For TF-CPU - See point 2

&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

1. Installing TensorFlow-GPU (TF) prebuilt binaries
TF Version &gt;= 1.13 requires CUDA 10.0 and TF Version &lt; 1.13 (till TF 1.5) requires CUDA 9.0.

If you have above configuration and using Windows platform -

Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the %PATH% environment variable.
Refer windows setup guide.


If you have above configuration and using Ubuntu/Linux platform -

Try adding the CUDA, CUPTI, and cuDNN installation directories to the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
Refer linux setup guide.


If error still persists then, apparently your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets.

Refer hardware requirements.



&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

2. Installing TensorFlow (TF) CPU prebuilt binaries
TensorFlow release binaries version 1.6 and higher are prebuilt with AVX instruction sets.
Therefore on any CPU that does not have these instruction sets, either CPU or GPU version of TF will fail to load.
Apparently, your CPU model does not support AVX instruction sets. You can still use TensorFlow with the alternatives given below:

Try Google Colab to use TensorFlow.

The easiest way to use TF will be to switch to google colab.You get pre-installed latest stable TF version. Also you can usepip install to install any other preferred TF version.
It has an added advantage since you can you easily switch to different hardware accelerators (cpu, gpu, tpu) as per the task.
All you need is a good internet connection and you are all set.


Try to build TF from sources by changing CPU optimization flags.

Please let us know if this helps.
