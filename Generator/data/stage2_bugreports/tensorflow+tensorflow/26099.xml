Yes.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 / Windows 7
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Official pip source (tensorflow-gpu)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.12.0
Python version: 3.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0 / 7.5
GPU model and memory: 1080Ti / 12GB

Describe the current behavior
tf.one_hot crashes when the indices tensor has dtype=tf.uint8
The error message shows Check failed: new_num_elements == NumElements()

Hello, I am new to the tensorflow community and which going thorugh the code I couldn't find gen_array_ops. If possible I would like to contribute to the issue.

gen_array_ops.py is located under tensorflow/python/ops/.
You can't find it on github because gen_array_ops is generated during building.
Basically it's a wrapper around the underlying C++ code of tensorflow. If you're interested, the C++ code of one_hot ops is located at tensorflow/core/kernels/one_hot_op.cc.

 Don't know if you had a chance to look into it and thank you for your interest!
Since you haven't posted an update for a while and I just looked into it, I will submit a fix now.
