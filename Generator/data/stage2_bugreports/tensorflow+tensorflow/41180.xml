Sorry for bothering. an error both found in tf1.15
System information

OS: Windows 10 1904
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): tensorflow 1.15 and tensorflow 2.1
Python version: python 3.6 for tensorflow 1.15, python 3.6 for tensorflow 2.1
CUDA/cuDNN version:10
GPU model and memory: Nvidia rtx 2080ti 11g

Describe the current behavior
Here is the source code of tensorflow.keras.backend.dot:
`
@keras_export('keras.backend.dot')
def dot(x, y):
"""Multiplies 2 tensors (and/or variables) and returns a tensor.
When attempting to multiply a nD tensor
with a nD tensor, it reproduces the Theano behavior.
(e.g. (2, 3) * (4, 3, 5) -&gt; (2, 4, 5))
Arguments:
x: Tensor or variable.
y: Tensor or variable.
Returns:
A tensor, dot product of x and y.
"""
if ndim(x) is not None and (ndim(x) &gt; 2 or ndim(y) &gt; 2):
x_shape = []
for i, s in zip(int_shape(x), tf.unstack(tf.shape(x))):
if i is not None:
x_shape.append(i)
else:
x_shape.append(s)
x_shape = tuple(x_shape)
y_shape = []
for i, s in zip(int_shape(y), tf.unstack(tf.shape(y))):
if i is not None:
y_shape.append(i)
else:
y_shape.append(s)
y_shape = tuple(y_shape)
y_permute_dim = list(range(ndim(y)))
y_permute_dim = [y_permute_dim.pop(-2)] + y_permute_dim
xt = tf.reshape(x, [-1, x_shape[-1]])
yt = tf.reshape(tf.transpose(y, perm=y_permute_dim), [y_shape[-2], -1])
return tf.reshape(tf.matmul(xt, yt),
x_shape[:-1] + y_shape[:-2] + y_shape[-1:])
if is_sparse(x):
out = tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul(x, y)
else:
out = tf.matmul(x, y)
return out
The issue is that I have a tensor x, which shape is (?,?,128) and a tensor y with shape (128,) . Thus , satisfy the  if judgement clause, and variant **y_permute_dim will be [0]**.  Next, an index out of range error would be raised from the codey_permute_dim = [y_permute_dim.pop(-2)] + y_permute_dim`.
It is obvious, for there is only one element in y_permute_dim.
This error was caught both in tensorflow_backend.py(tensorflow1.15), and source code is just the same in backend.py(tensorflow 2.1)
Looking forward for your reply.
Other info / logs I
File "d:\Anaconda3\envs\tf1.15\lib\site-packages\keras\backend\tensorflow_backend.py", line 1365, in dot
y_permute_dim = [y_permute_dim.pop(-2)] + y_permute_dim
IndexError: pop index out of range
