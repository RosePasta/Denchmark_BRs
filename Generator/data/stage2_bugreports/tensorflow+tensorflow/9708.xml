If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;



Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.4


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary


TensorFlow version (use command below):v1.1.0-rc0-61-g1ec6ed5 1.1.0


Bazel version (if compiling from source):


CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/5.1


GPU model and memory: Tesla m40 / 12 gb


Exact command to reproduce:


You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"

 the error message does look strange.

		Looking now.  The code looks fine so far, which is confusing.

		Ah, the problem is that Assert truncates its arguments at 3 entries by default.  The shapes are actually bigger, and presumably shape &lt; size someone in the invisible bit.  I'll fix the error message.

 Can you confirm that your tensors have rank &gt; 3?

 The tensors have the rank 3 only. But the issue seems like an OS related issue. The earlier run was erroneously reported as Ubuntu but was SLES 12. My apologies for the mistake. The code seems to run fine on the ubuntu machine that I tested today.  I do have to make it work on the SLES too. Is there any other reason apart from Assert truncation which might cause this issue?

 No idea why it would fail on SLES 12 only.  Please let us know if you figure out the cause, but I don't think we'll be able to debug it on our end without more information.
