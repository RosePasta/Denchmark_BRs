	<summary>tf .function gives different output than standard function</summary>
	<description>
No custom code. TF 2.3
I am trying to make a "backtest" differentiable so i decide to use tf.function's auto differentiation capability.
Despite taking a very long time to compile the function, finally it gets converted into TF ops. However the "loss" i get when running a TF version of the function and the python version are completely different.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;@tf.function
def get_loss(h_actions, nh_actions, prices):
    entry_point = 0.0
    exit_point = 0.0
    holding = False
    profit = 0.0
    index = 0
    fee = 0.001
    keep_perc = 1 - fee
    final_index = len(prices) - 1

    while index &lt; final_index:
        curr_price = prices[index]

        if holding:
            act_value = h_actions[index]
        else:
            act_value = nh_actions[index]

        if act_value &gt; 0.5:
            if holding is False:  # BUY
                holding = True
                entry_point = curr_price

            else:  # SELL
                holding = False
                exit_point = curr_price
                profit += (pow(keep_perc, 2) * exit_point / entry_point) - 1

        index += 1
    return profit
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The inputs for this function are precomputed predictions and price history is supplied.
I don't believe the values for these specifically are very important. I was able to produce the same behavior with a dummy set
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;samples = np.random.normal(size=(1000, 10))
prices = [random.uniform(1, 1000) for _ in range(1000)]
samples[:, -1] = 1
holding_preds = model.predict(samples)
samples[:, -1] = -1
not_holding_preds = model.predict(samples)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The only thing i see is that a warning in thrown saying that there's a large unroll loop. Other than that why would i get getting a different output?

		Can you share a dummy, minimal, but runnable model definition to run the dummy set?

		Please remove authentication from the colab example.

		My bad. Hopefully this is better &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uy8kr4efsRWB759M9avlpCOsWD3rQMpC?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uy8kr4efsRWB759M9avlpCOsWD3rQMpC?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I don't see the warning in the colab. Can you add something to show the wrong behavior?

		The losses don't match up. I added a line to show that they produce different values despite they are same function, one is just converted to TF

Thank you for this. I will look into these and see if there is a way to modify the code.
