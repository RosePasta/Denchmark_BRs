Describe the current behavior
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os
import pprint

if 'COLAB_TPU_ADDR' not in os.environ:
  print('ERROR: Not connected to a TPU runtime; please see the first cell in this notebook for instructions!')
else:
  tpu_address = 'grpc://' + os.environ['COLAB_TPU_ADDR']
  print ('TPU address is', tpu_address)
  
tf.config.experimental_connect_to_host(tpu_address)

cluster_resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver(tpu=tpu_address)
tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(cluster_resolver)
strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy(cluster_resolver)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
I get this error on the line - tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(cluster_resolver)

		In addition, I get a similar error when I try to run it with GPU. With all GPU-specific changes necessary, I am getting this error when I run it with GPU:

NotFoundError: No registered 'TensorDataset' OpKernel for GPU devices compatible with node {{node TensorDataset}}
.  Registered:  device='CPU'

		Hello, this error should be a basic issue that your Cloud TPU version is too old that does not contain the particular kernel you need. Could you try to contact Cloud TPU account team or raise an issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? I think you will need a tf 1.14 TPU at least (or tf-nightly), as it is close to tf 2.0 beta.

		I could reproduce the above issue with Tensorflow 2.0.0.alpha0 on colab. However, with TF2.0.0.beta0, the above code outputs expected output. Thanks!
