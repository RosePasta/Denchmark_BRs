		Did you use Chinese in your file but without a comment, #coding=utf-8,  at the start of it? If not so, I don't think that Windows system is suitable for tensor board. You could try Ubuntu, Linux or Mac System

		In Linux or Mac, you will get a link for tensorboard to watch it. But I am not sure whether it works in windows

 maybe issues with BOM on windows?

		@dcscodelife could you attach the events file?

		@KeyYD on Microsoft Windows you also get a link when TensorBoard starts.

		Is the problem maybe that the logdir is e:/ (which TensorBoard will interpret as a run called 'e' and the path \ on the same drive as the current working directory)? It looks like it's walking the entire filesystem, which is probably not what you wanted to happen.
Then I guess it's running into a filename that isn't UTF-8, perhaps because the filename handling code isn't Unicode aware?
As a workaround, I'd suggest putting your logs somewhere other than the root directory of your E: drive, so that TensorBoard doesn't encounter a file with a name it can't handle.

 Thank you everybody, sorry I have not followed this issue until today.
That day later it does work for me, I remember that I made a new folder 'log' in E:, then it worked.
The process I solved it:
Firstly, I give up do it under windows and try it on vmware ubuntu with the same file generated under windows, then it worked, so I think the file is ok, so I think maybe some others things I should try, then I tried something according to tutorial under windows, likely checked some format of command or folder path or name, then it worked.
But I forget the details,  cheerfully Tensorflow becomes more strongly than ever.

		Glad that you've found a solution. I'm closing this for now; if you want, you can re-open it in our new repository at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
