	<summary>Tensorflow installation document Korean translated page outdated</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install?hl=ko&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install?hl=ko&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

On installation document/windows build from source page, it tells that "TensorFlow를 컴파일하는 데 사용되는 빌드 도구인 Bazel 0.23.0을 설치합니다. C++를 빌드하도록 Bazel을 설정합니다." which means install Bazel 0.23.0 to compile Tensorflow. However, most recent version of Tensorflow which is r2.1, doesn't support Bazel 0.23.0. Instead, it uses 0.27.0~0.29.0. I checked English document and it tells me the version of Bazel that is needed. So, I think the Korean page should be renewed like this.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Bazel 설치&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

TensorFlow를 컴파일하는 데 사용되는 빌드 도구인 &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html&gt;Bazel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
을 설치합니다. tensorflow/configure.py에 명시된 _TF_MIN_BAZEL_VERSION과 _TF_MAX_BAZEL_VERSION 사이의 지원되는 버전을 사용합니다.
Bazel 실행 파일의 위치를 %PATH% 환경 변수에 추가합니다.

Unfortunately, I think It's not part of community translations. :(

		Sorry. Then where should I report this? I reported this issue at Tensorflow/Tensorflow but they told me to report here.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
This issue is for translation of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/install/source_windows.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/install/source_windows.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You know, Installation markdown is not part of community translations.
How can we fix the error? :)

		Reporting here is fine, thanks.
I need to run another internal translation job but hitting a bug :/
Will keep this open

		Sent off a new job for the /install section. tensorflow.org should be updated in a few weeks, but times can vary.
