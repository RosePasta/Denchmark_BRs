	<summary>import packages of tf2.0.0rc in pycharm</summary>
	<description>
i'm using tf2.0.0rc, win10.
when i write the below code in pycharm, Dataset is underlined with a red line, and shows a message cannot find reference 'Dataset' in '__init__.py' , and pycharm can't auto-complete Dataset's functions, but the script can run well.
from tensorflow_core.python.data import Dataset

dataset = Dataset.from_tensors([2])
when i write the below code, there is no red line, and pycharm can auto-complete Dataset's functions, but the script has error:KeyError: "Registering two gradient with name 'ReduceDataset'! (Previous registration was in register /home/xiefangyuan/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/framework/registry.py:66)"
from tensorflow_core.python.data.ops.dataset_ops import Dataset

dataset = Dataset.from_tensors([2])

		I have tried on colab with TF version 2.0.0-rc0, 2.0.0-rc1  and observed that
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow_core.python.data import Dataset

dataset = Dataset.from_tensors([2])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

has no issue. However i can reproduce the issue with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow_core.python.data.ops.dataset_ops import Dataset

dataset = Dataset.from_tensors([2])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/015651d955d4b6d1d2900daaa4efbe0c/untitled187.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

it is the same, the first one can run well, but in pycharm, there is no autocomplete, and cannot find reference 'Dataset' in 'init.py' . the second one support autocomplete, but it has error.
what i am expecting is both no error and autocomplete in pycharm. i just go back to use tf1.14.0.

		The supported way to use tensorflow is with the following import:
import tensorflow as tf
In this case, you would use tf.data.Dataset instead. If you want to use V1 dataset, then you can reference it using tf.compat.v1.data.Dataset.
Code under tensorflow_core.python or tensorflow.python is not a part of our public API and has no guarantees.

		Closing, since this question is about unsupported usecase for TensorFlow.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?

what i really want is autocomplete and no reference errors or warnings in pycharm editor(i think pycharm can standardize my code and prevent potential errors), but by writing import tensorflow as tf and using tf 2.0.0rc0, pycharm can not autocomplete tf's packages or functions, and show some reference errors in the editor not in the terminal, even though the code can run well, but the code doesn't look fine in the pycharm editor.
but never mind, up to now, i think stable tf 1.14.0 is better for me.

		You are right that 2.0.0rc0 had autocomplete issues. You can try 2.0.0rc1, which had some of the autocomplete issues fixed.
