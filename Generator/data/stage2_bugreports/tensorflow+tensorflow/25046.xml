Anyone have any suggestions, I tried updating to the latest CUDA/cuDNN but still facing this issue.

		update: after decreasing the batch size from 32 to 4, I have stopped getting this error

 Tensorflow 1.12 does not support cuda 10. The rc0 version 1.13 which does support cuda 10 is being released this week though acording to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/24839&gt;#24839&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I have removed cuda 10 and installed cuda 9.2 and I still occasionally get the same error. The problem is that tensorflow runs its own examples just fine(both on cuda 10 &amp; 9.2), but it crashes on my code sometimes.

 9.2 isnt supported either. The latest version supported is 9.0.

 is correct, r1.12.0 will run reliably with CUDA 9 &amp; cuDNN 7 ; TensorFlow tends to allocate memory greedily to each session created and assigned to GPU cores. So you have to experiment. Please let us know if you could scale stably to batch size of 32. Thanks.

 shouldnâ€™t be an issue now, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/humayunr7&gt;@humayunr7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should make sure his cudnn is compatible with cuda 10, but pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.0rc0 works with cuda 10.

 , I am currently running on CUDA 9.0, Tensorflow 1.12 and training stably on batch size of 32. Appreciate your help!
