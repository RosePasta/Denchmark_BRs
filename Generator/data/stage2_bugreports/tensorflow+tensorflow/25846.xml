	<description>
Please make sure that this is a documentation issue. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:doc_template
System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math/add

Describe the documentation issue
Much like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25802&gt;#25802&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, documentation for  is created from a generated file ; a link to the file that generates  would be handy for users.
tf.math.add could use a usage example, and a list of Errors raised.
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
Yes

 you can download from &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly-2.0-preview/&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

@Sangarshanan you can download from here

Yes that's the pip package.
The package is built from  with a 2.0 config flag... I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dynamicwebpaige&gt;@dynamicwebpaige&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 knows the exact commands. Paige is someone working on a install/source page for the tf2 docs?

a link to the file that generates python/ops/gen_math_ops.py would be handy for users.

Yes!
I believe it's &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc#L409&gt;this file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but I can't think of a way to find this by introspection while generating the docs. Anyone have ideas?
( I usually find them by searching for quotes from the tf.org page )

tf.math.add could use a usage example, and a list of Errors raised.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/josephhaaga&gt;@josephhaaga&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you send a PR?

You can build TF 2.0 from source with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;export TF_NEED_CUDA=0
cd tensorflow
yes "" | ./configure

bazel build --config=opt --config=v2 tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
mkdir pip_pkg
./bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package pip_pkg --nightly_flag \
  --project_name tf_nightly_2.0_preview

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I do not think that anyone is working on adding installation from source to the docs - but that would be a great add! So would the guide to modifying gen_math_ops.py documentation. ðŸ˜„
Thanks for your interest in improving the TF 2.0 API docs! We appreciate it.
