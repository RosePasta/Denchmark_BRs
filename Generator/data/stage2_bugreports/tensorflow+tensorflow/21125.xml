	<summary>TensorRT loses defined shapes</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
Bazel version: N/A
GPU model and memory: Titan 12Gb
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.10rc0
Python version: 3.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9 / 7.0.15

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When tf.contrib.tensorrt compiles a graph which can be fully compiled it loses shape information.
For example if you compile a graph which has no activations, for example a model which ends in an average pool so that you can get [N, C] then the shape information is lost.
If you load up that optimised model and try to add an operation on the end which required a shape definition, for example a tf.unstack it will fail out stating there isn't any shape information.
This seems like the output shape should be kept.

		It has been 14 days with no activity and the awaiting response label was assigned. Is this still an issue?
