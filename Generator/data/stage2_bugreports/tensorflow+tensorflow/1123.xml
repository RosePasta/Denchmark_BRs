	<summary>Error encountered when serializing moving_average_variables</summary>
	<description>
I compiled Tensorflow from source. Running cifar10_train.py outputs the following warning message:
WARNING:tensorflow:Error encountered when serializing moving_average_variables.
Type is unsupported, or the types of the items don't match field type in CollectionDef.
unbound method to_proto() must be called with Variable instance as first argument (got Tensor instance instead)

		Having the same issue. And the training command hangs. In fact, even the mnist example on setup page hangs too.

		Thanks for pointing out this warning! It's benign (for the training process), but unfortunate to have this in an example model. I have a patch in the pipeline that will fix the root cause for the warning.
