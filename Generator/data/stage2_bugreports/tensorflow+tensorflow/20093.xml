	<summary>Feature request: add Tensorflow.js</summary>
	<description>
Thanks for this tutorial, found it super-useful and helped me understand a lot. It would be great to see a version that uses Tensorflow.js / for Node, and how this works differently.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stopsatgreen&gt;@stopsatgreen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which tutorial are you referencing?
We have a variety of docs up on &lt;denchmark-link:http://js.tensorflow.org&gt;http://js.tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and our examples repo has some node-specific demos as well: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Sorry, it was . I went through the Python demo, which was great, would love to see the same for JS.

		Glad you found it helpful. There are no plans to port that specific tutorial to TensorFlow.js, but there are others available here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/&gt;https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But will keep  in mind for the future. Thanks.
