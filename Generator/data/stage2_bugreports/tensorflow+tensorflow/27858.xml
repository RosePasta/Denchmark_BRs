	<summary>tf.summary.tensor_summary no longer appears in the REPL, see it in the code? Docs need update?</summary>
	<description>
Not sure what the intention is as I see a lot of v1/v2 name changing.
tf.summary.scalar is there but not tf.summary.tensor_summary
In [80]: tf.version
Out[80]: '2.0.0-alpha0'

		I am not finding a "deprecated" notices here for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary/tensor_summary&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary/tensor_summary&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  is part of  version only and it will stay with TF1.x. I think there is no need for deprecation warning. For example, &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.14/api_docs/python/tf/Session&gt;tf.session&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is part of  only and hence there is no deprecation warning.
Please let us know what you think. Please close this issue if it was resolved. Thanks!
