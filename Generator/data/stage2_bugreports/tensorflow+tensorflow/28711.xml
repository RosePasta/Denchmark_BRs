	<summary>Tensorflow lite demo app gives wrong result in GPU delegate (Honor Play Android 9.0 GPU Turbo)</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Android 9.0 (API 28)
Mobile device : Huawei Honor Play 9.0 ,GPU: Mali G72 MP12 (GPU Turbo)
TensorFlow installed from: tensorflow-lite:0.0.0-gpu-experimental

Describe the current behavior
The tensorflow lite gpu delegate demo application gives incorrect results for image classification , when it is run on GPU; whereas the same float model gives correct results when it is run on CPU.Even the quantized model in the demo application gave correct inference results in this application.We even tried the official deeplab model for semantic segmentation with the same phone; but even in this scenario it gave wrong results (square/stripes), instead of correct masks.
The same model is running in other phones with Adreno GPU and also in some phones with Mali GPU (eg: Samsung A8+ Android 9.0).
Describe the expected behavior
The tensorflow lite gpu inference should give same results in cpu and gpu in all the android phones.
Other info / logs
It looks like the  phone uses a new feature called GPU Turbo .Initially the model
was working correctly with android 8.1 (stock os).But after the 9.0 upgrade the tflite models are giving wrong results.

		It is working fine in tensorflow-lite:0.0.1-gpu-experimental and latest nightly version ...
