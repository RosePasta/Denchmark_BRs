	<summary>Tensorflow.image.resize_images not upgraded</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0a0
Python version: 3.7.3

Describe the current behavior
The function tensorflow.image.resize_images() is not upgraded with the tf_upgrade_v2 script. It is not replaced with any working function in tf2.
Describe the expected behavior
The function to be converted to tf.image.resize()?
Code to reproduce the issue
Upgrade the following code with tf_upgrade_v2 and run it in tensorflow 2.0
import tensorflow

tensorflow.image.resize_images()

 The function tensorflow.image.resize_images() has been upgraded with tf.image.resize() in TF 2.0. For more information refer this &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/image/resize&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		Yes, I saw that. But shouldn't tf_upgrade_v2 then automatically convert to this? Now I run into errors when I upgrade my project to TensorFlow 2.0, since the function is not automatically converted.

		The tf_upgrade_v2 converter tool looks for tf keyword.
Following changes to your code should do the trick,
import tensorflow as tf
tf.image.resize_images()
Output after executing the converter tool:
INFO line 12:0: Renamed 'tf.image.resize_images' to 'tf.image.resize'

		Ah okay, but that is still very confusing.
Why wouldn't tensorflow upgrade tensorflow imports? Tf is only an (unofficial) shorthand for tensorflow that is commonly used, but there is nothing wrong with just import tensorflow.

		This is a limitation of the converter tool as of now. However making it more robust to cases like these is on our road map. Please use import tensorflow as tf with upgrade script. Thanks!
