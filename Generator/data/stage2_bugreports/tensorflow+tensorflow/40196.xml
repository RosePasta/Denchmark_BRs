	<summary>2.3 Nightly build produces error when initializing system in TF documentation's Colab tutorial</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: NO
TensorFlow installed from: pip (tf-nightly)
TensorFlow version: 2.3.0-dev20200605

Describe the current behavior
TPU won't initialize in colab using the nightly build.

Run the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tpu&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tpu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 notebook successfully, as one would if using TF 2.2.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue

Load https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tpu in colab.
Run !pip install tf-nightly in a new cell before running anything else.
Run the TPU initialization section of the notebook.
Observe the following error:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have tried in  colab with TF nightly version () .Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/0dcb9b852c34d150ef74573641eeef22/untitled54.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Yes, the InvalidArgumentError is the same error I experienced.

		That indicates a version mismatch between your colab client and TPU worker. Is your TPU worker also nightly?

 I don't see how to determine without modifying the steps indicated above whether the TPU worker is using a nightly version of tf. Would you mind posting how to determine this?
I did see your trick here, which seems to be related to provisioning a worker at a certain version level rather than inspecting its properties: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34346#issuecomment-598399912&gt;#34346 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Regardless, I just retried the steps outlined in my bug report. I no longer see the error I reported.
Perhaps the default versions in colab notebooks are no longer mismatched.
