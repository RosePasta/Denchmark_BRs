System information

OS: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (Google Colab)
tf version: 2.4.0
tf git version: v2.4.0-0-g582c8d236cb

Code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from keras import *
from keras.layers import *

X = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size = (1, 1000))
y = np.array([[0.7974]])

for _ in range(6):
  model = Sequential([
    Input(shape = 1000),
    Dense(1, activation = 'sigmoid'),
  ])

  model.compile(loss = 'mse', optimizer = 'adam')
  model.fit(X, y, batch_size = 1, epochs = 100, verbose = 0)
  print(model.predict(X))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to &lt;function Model.make_predict_function.&lt;locals&gt;.predict_function at 0x7f38dc45f0d0&gt; triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.

Is this warning a bug, or am I doing something wrong?

		Its a warning but this behavior is deprecated.
Retracing of graph is an expensive operation to do and when model was created for the first time a graph was initialized. while it is in the loop it is being retraced completely again and again over the same graph to find the answer which is initialized everytime the loop runs .so it is advised to keep the below part of the code outside the loop.

These are just warnings and will not have any impact on the performance, please follow as mentioned above.
