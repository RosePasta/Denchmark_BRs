	<summary>The train and test data of wide and deep example is broken</summary>
	<description>
Wide and deep example code will download train and test data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data and https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test. But those files are broken now and you can wget to read the raw data.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;|1x3 Cross validator
25, Private, 226802, 11th, 7, Never-married, Machine-op-inspct, Own-child, Black, Male, 0, 0, 40, United-States, &lt;=50K.
38, Private, 89814, HS-grad, 9, Married-civ-spouse, Farming-fishing, Husband, White, Male, 0, 0, 50, United-States, &lt;=50K.
28, Local-gov, 336951, Assoc-acdm, 12, Married-civ-spouse, Protective-serv, Husband, White, Male, 0, 0, 40, United-States, &gt;50K.
44, Private, 160323, Some-college, 10, Married-civ-spouse, Machine-op-inspct, Husband, Black, Male, 7688, 0, 40, United-States, &gt;50K.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I modify the file and run with this command, it works. Maybe we should fix the raw dataset or change to other valid files.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python ./wide_n_deep_tutorial.py --train_data /home/data/train_data --test_data /home/data/test_data
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Someone has asked the similar question in stackoverflow, &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38558976/tensorflow-wide-deep-example-not-working&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38558976/tensorflow-wide-deep-example-not-working&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow: 0.9.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Clone the tensorflow project and run python wide_n_deep_tutorial.py directly.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs or other output that would be helpful&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 Thanks for filing this issue!
I see that the |1x3 Cross validator line in adult.test is unexpected.  Did you find any other issues in the two files?
We welcome pull requests to fix these kinds of problems!

 .
These two files have unexpected empty line at the end of the files. After removing the first line of |1x3 Cross validator and the empty lines at the end, it will work.
I'm not sure who maintains these datasets. How can we create the pull-request and contribute for this?

		You can fork the repo, work on your own branch to make the changes, and then submit a pull request.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/terrytangyuan&gt;@terrytangyuan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I knew how to create pull-request. I mean how to fix this issue. The dataset is from  which may be beyond the scope of TensorFlow.
Would you like to maintain the dataset by yourselves? Or contact someone who can fix this.

		Automatically closing due to lack of recent activity. Since this issue is old at this point, please reopen the issue if it still occurs when tried with the latest version of Tensorflow. Thank you.
