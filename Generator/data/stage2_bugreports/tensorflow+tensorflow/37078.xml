	<summary>Documentation issue about tf.math.xlog1py (nightly-only APIs)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/xlog1py&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/xlog1py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This documentation describes , shown as a part of "stable" version of TF 2.1 but I believe this API has not been released yet.  is only available on nightly at this point, added in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/19986377f2a3c560418f42f2323733564a7303eb&gt;1998637&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (Jan 2020).
FYI: I ran into this issue as I was using tfp-nightly which depends on tf-nightly (module 'tensorflow_core._api.v2.math' has no attribute 'xlog1py').
The documentation should have not published under "TensorFlow Core v2.1.0". Why was it the case? If it was due to a mistake, could we improve on the process so we can have a "nightly" doc and a "stable" doc?

 Agree. This is not part of . &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/6aa619234a38c34150e4b447d4037c66/untitled834.ipynb&gt;Here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the gist for our reference. With  it works as expected. But with the , it throws the following error. Thanks!

		Hi, This is an artifact of how the nightly diff are generated.
Like here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/?version=nightly#for_example&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/?version=nightly#for_example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This page has no left-nav, because it's only generated in nightly.
We should make the whole thing green, or add a a sort of [NEW] banner so it's clear what the status is.

		Thanks -- I see. Yes, I agree that for the pages that should be only available in nightly, more clear status needs to be displayed. (Please feel free to change the issue title to a more general one if you think appropriate)
What actually confused me is the header:

TensorFlow &gt; API &gt; TensorFlow Core v2.1.0 &gt; Python

which sounds like it is a part of TF 2.1.0. FYI, I directly got to the page from google search results so wasn't aware of "See Stable" v.s. "See Nightly" modes (which is nice BTW).
So one of my suggestions is to have a different version name in this navigation banner (e.g., TensorFlow Core Nightly).

		This should get fixed tomorrow. There will be a note at the top of the page saying that the API is only available in nightly.

		I see this is now &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/xlog1py&gt;fixed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thank you for the support!

Note: This API is new and only available intf-nightly.

		The space between in and tf-nightly should get fixed by tomorrow.
