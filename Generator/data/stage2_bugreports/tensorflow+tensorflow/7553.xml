	<summary>The updated documentation site does not contain "Setting up TensorFlow for Development"</summary>
	<description>
Recently the TensorFlow web site is updated, and some contents are re-organized.
Since I always forget how to install TF from sources, such as "bazel build ..." then "bazel-bin/...", I frequently refer the official web site.
However, after the update, "Setting up TensorFlow for Development" section has gone away (which were originally located at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
I think the contents should be included in "Installing TensorFlow from sources" section, if there was no change in the way for setting for development.

		Good catch and sorry for the omission.  I will get it added back in a couple of days.

		It looks like that this has been fixed in the latest release. See:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
