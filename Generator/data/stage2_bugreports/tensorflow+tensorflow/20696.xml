	<summary>ValueError when loading multiple tf.contrib.keras models in the same scope at different times</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.8.0
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version: N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 7.5, cuDNN 9.0
GPU model and memory: GTX1080 (8GB)
Exact command to reproduce: See this snippet

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

TensorFlow throws a ValueError: You are trying to load a weight file containing 16 layers into a model with 0 layers when trying to create multiple instances of a pretrained Keras model from within the same scope. This only happens if the instances are created one at a time, reopening the same scope multiple times, and works if all the instances are created consecutively, after opening the scope a single time.
Of course, in a real world scenario these instances are created from different places and not all at the same time while building the model, so one would actually need to reopen that scope multiple times.
Hope this helps and that the snippet is clear enough!

See &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Sergio0694/aa36c7ed94091ce5503ad908b142aaf0&gt;this snippet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, same one posted under system information.
Here's the stack trace for the snippet above:

		Done 
Not sure how to trigger the bot to re-check the message, or if it's just automatic &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflowbutler&gt;@tensorflowbutler&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
