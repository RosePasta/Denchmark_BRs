		Some information will be needed to solve this issue:
1): Where should it even point to, the Product Roadmap button?
2): Where is the code for the website where we can edit the href tag to a correct location?
3): Is this even the right place to make the issue?
Help from moderators I think will be more accurate.
Will it be a good idea to tag them here?

		No, I mean, should the  button at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 even go to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/roadmap&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/roadmap&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
If yes, then the contents of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/roadmap&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/roadmap&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should be updated.
If no, where else should it go? Is the 404 currently on purpose, a mistake, or a bug, or just a broken link?
I don't have any experience with how the website is built or its routes, but I would love to help given the right directions.

		Thanks. We'll fix the button since that page was out of date.

		closing as the roadmap link is not present in the community &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community&gt;webpage&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
re-open if required.

		Can we remove it also from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/README.md#resources&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/README.md#resources&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
