	<summary>TFLite: Cannot run inference on TF Lite Model: "Regular TensorFlow ops are not supported by this interpreter."</summary>
	<description>
System information

OSX
TF 2.3.0-dev20200602

Command used to run the converter or code if you’re using the Python API
If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Conversion code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(curr_dir + "saved_model")
    tflite_model = converter.convert()

    # Save the TF Lite model.
    with tf.io.gfile.GFile(curr_dir + '/model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(tflite_model)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Inference code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    # Compare Inference
    import tensorflow as tf

    # Load the TFLite model and allocate tensors.
    interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="./model.tflite")
    interpreter.allocate_tensors()

    # Get input and output tensors.
    input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
    output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The model I'm trying to convert to tflite and run inference on is SSDLite_MobileNetV2, obtained rom the Model Zoo:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_09.tar.gz&gt;http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_09.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Failure details
Conversion is successful, however I cannot run inference: Here is the error that I run into:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;RuntimeError: Regular TensorFlow ops are not supported by this interpreter. 
Make sure you apply/link the Flex delegate before inference.Node number 3 (FlexTensorArrayV3) failed to prepare.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I've been playing around with converter settings with no luck
i.e. combinations of:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    # converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
    # converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS,
    #                                        tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

With none of the settings above set, or the supported_ops set, I can convert the model but cannot run inference, with a similar error as above.
With optimizations set to default, it gives me an error in conversion

 for continuing to give me updates on this - I appreciate it very much!
I tried to update my Tensorflow (using tf-nightly to get latest HEAD of master) and run inference on a model with both ops - however I still run into the same error. Perhaps there's a flag in Interpreter that needs to be set to enable flex ops?
Here's the code I'm using for inference:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Load the TFLite model and allocate tensors.
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="./model.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

# Get input and output tensors.
input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Error happens on allocate_tensors() function:
Here is the error:

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thaink&gt;@thaink&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried your notebook with a fresh environment and wasn't able to get it to work. Still get the same issue:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;RuntimeError: Regular TensorFlow ops are not supported by this interpreter. Make sure you apply/link the Flex delegate before inference.Node number 3 (FlexTensorArrayV3) failed to prepare.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Version of tf-nightly: 2.3.0-dev20200625 running with Python 3.7
This very odd...
Can you re-try with a fresh environment and let me know?

Flex-ops only models can support this ops so it will not be removed.

Hi
i convert my frozen graph to tflite. when inference it, the inference code is
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="converted_model.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()
input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()
input_shape = input_details[0]['shape']
input_data = np.array(np.random.random_sample(input_shape), dtype=np.float32)
interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)
interpreter.invoke()
output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
print(output_data)
i get the below error:
RuntimeError: Container __per_step_0 does not exist. (Could not find resource:__per_step_0/_tensor_arraysbidirectional_rnn/bw/bw/dynamic_rnn/input_0_1)

 TensorArrayScatterV3 does not works with flex delegate in most case.
For now, you'll need to remove it from the mode.

 I think you have to replace it in the training code. Then train the model and convert it again.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thaink&gt;@thaink&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I train and save .pb model with TensorFlow 1.15.0 and  try to convert .pb file to .tflite file with tf-nightly
Main codes:
coverter = tf.compat.v1.lite.TFliteConverter.from_frozen_graph()
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS, tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT]
converter.experimental_new_converter = True
Error:
RuntimeError: Regular TensorFlow ops are not supported by this interpreter. Make sure you apply/link the Flex delegate before inference. Node  number 3 (FlexSign) failed to prepare.
Seems like it's the problem with tf.sign and I DO have tf.sign in my model and there is BiLSTM layer in my model. So does it mean I have to implement tf.sign op on my own or are there other solutions?
Thank you.

 Sign is supported by flex delegate so the conversion must be fine.
I think the problem here is a typo.
could you use tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS instead of tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT

,
I am using tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS, sorry for my mistake. And I'm trying tf-nightly 2.4.0 for  flex delegate.
Another question,  I'm using tf 15.0 to define and train the model. In the step of defining model, is 'tf.enable_control_flow_v2()' a must?
Without this, there are errors like
‘converting unsupported op Enter and TensorArrayV3’
Thank you

 I don't think define the model in a version and convert an a different version is a good practice.
Could you try to define the model with nightly? You can just try to convert it, no need to train.

 OK, I will give it a try. Is tf-nightly 1.* available and where can I get them? Since code between tf 1.* and 2.* is a little different, I want to try tf-nightly 1.*

You can try disable_v2_behavior on nightly and see if it is what you expect.

tf.contirb.cnn.BasicLSTMCell()

tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn()

 Just replace TF layer declaration by Keras
Original:
outputs, _ = tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn(lstm_fw_cell, lstm_bw_cell, embedded_chars, dtype=tf.float32)

outputs = tf.keras.layers.Birdirectional(lstm_cell, merge_mode="concat")(embedded_chars)

You can enable it with "--use_xnnpack=true" option.
