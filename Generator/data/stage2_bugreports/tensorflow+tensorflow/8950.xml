	<summary>Execution Stuck after few steps in sess.run()</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Execution is stuck in between steps. For few steps, it seems to run fine but after that the execution just halts without throwing any exception or the error.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I ran the mnist_deep.py script provided in tutorials.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What other attempted solutions have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Previously, the display used to get hang showing error CUDA_LAUNCH_ERROR_TIMEOUT. On nvidia forum, someone suggested to switch off the X-server. I switched it off, but the problem still persisted.
I noticed that the script was hogging full memory of GPU, I tried to limit the allocation by using "allow_growth" flag. But the problem still persists.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs or other output that would be helpful&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 did we check recently that  works?

		/CC: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jmchen-g&gt;@jmchen-g&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it's related to models.

		That's odd, I just ran it and it worked fine for me. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ajeetksingh&gt;@ajeetksingh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you make sure that you aren't running anything else on the GPU at the same time? And it's normal for it to use the full memory.
My output below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;step 0, training accuracy 0.14
step 100, training accuracy 0.76
step 200, training accuracy 0.9
step 300, training accuracy 0.82
...
step 19700, training accuracy 1
step 19800, training accuracy 1
step 19900, training accuracy 1

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Can you check what your % CPU utilization is while TF hangs? What is the model of your motherboard?

		Automatically closing due to lack of recent activity. Since this issue is old at this point, please reopen the issue if it still occurs when tried with the latest version of Tensorflow. Thank you.
