	<summary>Empty step_stats from context.export_run_metadata() in TF 2.1</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Colab

As sessions are no more available in TF 2 API we are using context.enable_run_metadata() and context.export_run_metadata() to accure run_metadata.step_stats which then we feed to timeline.Timeliner to export tracing information about session execution and visualise it usgin chrome://tracing. This approch worked well with TF 2.0 but once we updated to 2.1 run_metadata.step_stats appears to be empty.
Here is code which acquires and prints step stats:
TF 2.0: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jsk7Dn_gTd3xCTTxgQPx3bJvza4oRu1t&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jsk7Dn_gTd3xCTTxgQPx3bJvza4oRu1t&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

TF 2.1: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JQ7rqyH5VOAmpHbjMuLGYLwU9dJ7xwk2&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JQ7rqyH5VOAmpHbjMuLGYLwU9dJ7xwk2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I know that according to docs we should use  or  to acquire tracing information, however, there is seems an issue with GPU tracing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34844&gt;#34844&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Was able to reproduce the issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/3dab2da9961c6834738404f87f7f4deb/36314_2-0.ipynb&gt;TF 2.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		probably a duplicate of 34844
can you make sure that running "!ldconfig -p | grep cupti" in your colab?

		Here is the output of !ldconfig -p | grep cupti
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;libcupti.so.10.1 (libc6,x86-64) =&gt; /usr/local/cuda-10.1/extras/CUPTI/lib64/libcupti.so.10.1
libcupti.so (libc6,x86-64) =&gt; /usr/local/cuda-10.1/extras/CUPTI/lib64/libcupti.so
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So seems 34844 has been already fixed in colab
But no step stats
Anyway after using fix from 34844 we are able to get GPU profile using tensorboard, so this issue is not so critical anymore at least for us (yet traces converted from step_stats are more informative then those in tensorboard)

		unfortunately, profiler team don't support step_stats anymore in favor of new "tf 2.0 profiler".

		We have just released a new profiler in TF 2.2 rc0.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler&gt;https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

One of the profiler output is trace.json.gz, that can be directly upload to chrome://tracing to visualize.
Please try if the new profiler fixes your issue.
If it doesn't, we will follow up with you.
thanks
