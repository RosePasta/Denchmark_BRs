When I run the following .ipynb:

I got:

		Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?.
I tried with TF 1.14 ,1.15.0-rc3, 1.13.1 and i am able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/f66344f948481ed6af0d25cbfcb08b06/untitled261.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.But in the colab link you have shared i am not seeing any error.Can you please confirm is this expected behavior?.Thanks!

 Thanks for your replies.
I use your gist and find new error:

I just use colab,all edition of (operating system,architecture) are same as yours.
I just use the default tensorflow edition in colab.
The colab link is:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com&gt;https://colab.research.google.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you help me? thanks

 I looked at your code. There are multiple updates you need to do before it runs. For instance,  is not supported with TPU distribution strategy and you also need to define, compile and fit the  under . Can you please follow the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training&gt;TF Resource here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and update your code.
You could also find some TPU codes from github users &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/30162&gt;like this  one&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

This code is from some technical news by a small company.
it did not tell any version requirements of tensorflow.
So I met such a problem.
Could you help me fix it?Thanks
And it seems that it is really an internal bug of Tensorflow

But only the developer know the meaning of each word of this error.
It's impossible for users to understand the meaning without the help of developer.
Thanks.
