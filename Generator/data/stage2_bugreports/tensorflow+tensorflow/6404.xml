	<summary>Confusion about Cuda install docs for Mac</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System: Mac OSX 10.11
The docs have 2 issues related to this section at the top:
"The GPU version works best with Cuda Toolkit 8.0 and cuDNN v5. Other versions are supported (Cuda toolkit &gt;= 7.0 and cuDNN &gt;= v3) only when installing from sources. Please see Cuda installation for details. For Mac OS X, please see Setup GPU for Mac."


The link to "Setup GPU for Mac" doesn't work; presumably the href target is missing or misspelled.


The Setup GPU for Mac section is included in the "Install Tensorflow from Source" part of the docs. Several people I know interpreted that to mean that GPU support is only available when installing from source. Furthermore, in the same section is a requirement to use homebrew, and many people I know refuse to use homebrew, so they assumed that Tensorflow was unusable on mac for them.


I recommend separating out the Setup GPU for Mac instructions to a separate page, unless it truly is dependent on installing from source. If it is, that should also be clarified.

		The link problem is the same as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6389&gt;#6389&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
