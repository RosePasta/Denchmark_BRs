System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

Command used to run the converter or code if youâ€™re using the Python API
If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Copy and paste here the exact command
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The output from the converter invocation
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Copy and paste the output here.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also, please include a link to the saved model or GraphDef
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Put link here or attach to the issue.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Failure details
If the conversion is successful, but the generated model is wrong,
state what is wrong:

Producing wrong results and/or decrease in accuracy
Producing correct results, but the model is slower than expected (model generated from old converter)

RNN conversion support
If converting TF RNN to TFLite fused RNN ops, please prefix [RNN] in the title.
Any other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
