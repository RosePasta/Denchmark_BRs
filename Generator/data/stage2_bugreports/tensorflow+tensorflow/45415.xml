System information

Host OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
Tensorflow version (commit SHA if source): master
Target platform (e.g. Arm Mbed OS, Arduino Nano 33 etc.): Sparkfun Edge

Describe the problem
I am about to port The TF Lite kernel op EXP to TF Lite Micro.
Please provide the exact sequence of commands/steps when you ran into the problem
Below are the first steps I will take to port the op EXP:

PR 1: refactor flatbuffer_conversions parsing function
PR 2: refactor reference implementation from lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h into its own header without making any changes.
PR 3: copy the reference kernel from lite to micro without making any changes. At this point the kernel is in micro but it is not part of the build.
