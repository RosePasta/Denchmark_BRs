	<summary>Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime.</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source):

Provide the text output from tflite_convert
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If those are native TensorFlow operators, you might be able to use the extended runtime by passing --enable_select_tf_ops, or by setting target_ops=TFLITE_BUILTINS,SELECT_TF_OPS when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Otherwise, if you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Here is a list of builtin operators you are using: ADD, ADD_N, CAST, CONCATENATION, CONV_2D, FLOOR, FULLY_CONNECTED, GATHER_ND, LOGISTIC, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM, MUL, PACK, RESHAPE, RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR, STRIDED_SLICE, SUB. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: ROUND.


&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also, please include a link to a GraphDef or the model if possible.
Any other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		For converting a model to , please have a look at this similar problem &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/29124&gt;#29124&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I tested it 【&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_select&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_select&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime and are not recognized by TensorFlow. If you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Here is a list of builtin operators you are using: ADD, ADD_N, CAST, CONCATENATION, CONV_2D, FLOOR, FULLY_CONNECTED, GATHER_ND, LOGISTIC, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM, MUL, PACK, RESHAPE, RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR, STRIDED_SLICE, SUB.

		Only added --allow_custom_ops Can generate **.tflite.
But it can't be loaded in Android studio demo。

		Please consider opening a new issue if you have a problem with Android Studio and mark this as closed.

		In fact, they are a problem, because adding --allow_custom_ops ignores the error and causes an error on andrdoistudio. So you can't add --allow_custom_ops , of course I tried --target_ops=TFLITE_BUILTINS, SELECT_TF_OPS This is not possible. The log information is above.

		Oh yes, you are right.
Then please consider the example of transforming the  to an tf.lite instance &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_custom&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If that is not an option for you, maybe you can apply the function that is not compatible with  outside of your graph in order to avoid writing much extra code.

		ROUND is now a builtin op, which version of TensorFlow are you using? You should be able to convert/run with the latest nightly.

		Then please consider the example of transforming the sin to an tf.lite instance here.
The link here can't be opened.
The current version is 1.13.1. I think it should be consistent with the version of the algorithm engineer. Not used 2.0.0.
The version used in android-studio is 0.0.0-nightly(" implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:0.0.0-nightly'")

		For me the link works. Here once again &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_custom&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_custom&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I tried the 2.0. version, the same error, Round 。

		It seems that only try   &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_custom%E3%80%82&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_custom。&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But it feels very troublesome.
