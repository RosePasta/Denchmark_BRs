	<summary>Bug in Estimator tutorial?</summary>
	<description>
This is the tutorial for the Estimator-class:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/estimators&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/estimators&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You have the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;my_nn = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(feature_columns=[age, height, weight],
                                   hidden_units=[10, 10, 10],
                                   activation_fn=tf.nn.relu,
                                   dropout=0.2,
                                   n_classes=3,
                                   optimizer="Adam")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;input_layer = tf.feature_column.input_layer(
    features=features, feature_columns=[age, height, weight])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I understand correctly, the feature-columns use the variables age, height and weight. However, these variables are not defined anywhere in the source-code for the tutorial.
The complete source-code is available in abalone.py as well:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/estimators/abalone.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/estimators/abalone.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But here you no longer have the input_layer that uses the feature-columns. Instead you have the following which pulls out "x" from the features-dict:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Connect the first hidden layer to input layer
# (features["x"]) with relu activation
first_hidden_layer = tf.layers.dense(features["x"], 10, activation=tf.nn.relu)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So I'm a bit confused how this is supposed to work?
In general, why don't you make the tutorials as Jupyter Notebooks instead? It would be immensely more helpful than your current tutorial style which is very confusing.
And please remember, that for each hour you spend polishing the code, you will likely save several hours of head-aches for each person trying to understand your code. Multiplied by the many thousands of TensorFlow users, this is a tremendous amount of work-hours that is freed up for the community!

		The reason for using files rather than notebooks is probably for testing reasons. IE, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d040289dcf825fe2ac9579f4b0175a23833a57fa/tensorflow/tools/ci_build/builds/test_tutorials.sh&gt;test_tutorials.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 runs all the files and make sure they don't crash.

, can you comment why  is not used in the source file?
The issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/11785&gt;#11785&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggests having Jupyter Notebook tutorials. Pinging &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wolffg&gt;@wolffg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We're working on improved estimator docs now.  In the interim, another
source of information is Magnus's blog post:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/09/introducing-tensorflow-datasets.html&gt;https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/09/introducing-tensorflow-datasets.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Looks like the docs may have gotten a bit out of sync with recent code updates to align with the latest version of the Estimator API. As wolffg mentioned, we are in the process of updating the estimator docs now.

		This doc has been replaced by these two files:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/custom_estimators&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/custom_estimators&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/get_started/custom_estimator.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/get_started/custom_estimator.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It is 100% true we should remove the outdated sample still in tensorflow/tensorflow, but outdated sample cleanup is being tracked elsewhere, so I'm closing this.  Thanks for reporting this.
