	<summary>tf.gfile.Open has different semantics from open</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): N/A
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.13
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.8.0-0-g93bc2e2072 1.8.0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: N/A

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 in  mode delays the creation of the file until the first write. This is different from the buitin &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open&gt;open&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which creates a file right away. I am not sure if this is a bug, or the intended behaviour, but I think should be clarified in the documention of .
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; import tensorflow as tf
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.gfile.Open("hdfs://root/tmp/user/test", "wb").close()
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.gfile.Exists("hdfs://root/tmp/user/test")
# ...
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.gfile.Open("/tmp/test", "wb").close()
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.gfile.Exists("/tmp/test")
False

, I believe this is expected behavior. We'd definitely appreciate a documentation improvement PR. The general story is that gfile can't and doesn't try to match semantics as it is an abstraction layer, so file systems vary on different platforms.

, is there anybody who can provide better insight on gfile?

 just to be clear, the issue here is not the platform-specific differences (both HDFS and local FS behave consistently). The behaviour of GFile is different from Python (on all platforms, I assume).

 This is (at this point) intended behavior, as it would be infeasible to change it. I agree with you though that this should be clarified in the documentation. Would you like to send a PR for this? Thanks!
