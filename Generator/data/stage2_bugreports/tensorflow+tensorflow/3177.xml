run wide_n_deep.py on python 3.5
2.
3.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;




&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs or other output that would be helpful&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

(If logs are large, please upload as attachment).
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'dict_items' and 'dict_items'
This is because python3.5 does not support + between dict_items. I worked around using dict.copy(), but still get error and could proceed. Do you have plan to release python 3.5 version in near future?

		in wide_n_deep_tutorial.py, change the following line:
feature_cols = dict(continuous_cols.items() + categorical_cols.items())
to
feature_cols = {**continuous_cols , **categorical_cols}
this change makes wide_n_deep_tutorial.py compatible with Python 3.x.
Now simply run it like:
python3.5 wide_n_deep_tutorial.py --model_type=wide
note that the wide_n_deep option (--model_type=wide_n_deep) still has an error due to a compatibility issue in dnn_linear_combined.py
