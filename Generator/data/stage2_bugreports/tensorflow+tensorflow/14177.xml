	<summary>Getting wrong value with placeholder</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No, I have used code which is on the link.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Installing with native pip (tensorflow-gpu)
TensorFlow version (use command below):
'1.3.0'
Python version:
Python 2.7.12
('v1.3.0-rc2-20-g0787eee', '1.3.0')
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.5) 5.4.0 20160609
CUDA/cuDNN version:
CUDA : release 8.0, V8.0.61
cuDNN: CUDNN_MAJOR      6
GPU model and memory:
GeForce 940MX
Memory: 2GB
Driver Version: 384.90

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I run at below code, I think i am getting the wrong result.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session()
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
adder_node = a + b
print(sess.run(adder_node, {a: 3, b: 4.5}))
print(sess.run(adder_node, {a: [1, 3], b: [2, 4]}))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


My Output :
3.0
[ 1. 3.]


I think the true result should be;
7.5
[ 3. 7.]

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Also, when i type sess = tf.Session() , i am getting that output

		Hmm....I'm unable to reproduce the error using TensorFlow 1.3.0 (I see the correct outputs of 7.5 and [3, 7]. The outputs you see make sense if the line was adder_node = a instead of adder_node = a + b!
I don't have the same driver/GPU as you, though I doubt those would be to blame. But just to be extra sure, do you see the same errors when using just the CPU, say with:
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.Session()
with tf.device('/cpu:0'):
  a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
  b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
  adder_node = a + b
print(sess.run(adder_node, {a: 3, b: 4.5}))
print(sess.run(adder_node, {a: [1, 3], b: [2, 4]}))
The log output you mentioned above is just informational logs. I didn't see any concerning notes in that.

 Thank you for your interest. When i run over CPU with at above code, i got the true result.  and .

		Hmm...that's weird.
Do you see the same problem with TensorFlow 1.4.0? Is it possible for you to try this on a different machine (specifically, one with a different driver/CUDA version/GPU or something)? Or, does upgrading CUDA/the NVIDIA driver make any difference?

  . I have also tried with Python 3.5.2 and Tensorflow '1.4.0' which is installed with pip3 tensorflow - gpu. I got same wrong results.   I think the problem is related to GPU, it is old and has small memory. Thank you for your all effort.
