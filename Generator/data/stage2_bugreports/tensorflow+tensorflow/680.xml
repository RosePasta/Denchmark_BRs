	<summary>Document parse_single_sequence_example</summary>
	<description>
The docs are completely silent on parse_single_sequence_example, even though the (officially referenced) tf.train.Example protocol buffers documentation mentions SequenceExample, and the documentation for parse_single_sequence_example in the source code (parsing_ops.py) appears rather complete. I think just exposing the source code documentation would be very helpful to people. In general though SequenceExample could use better documentation as it's a very useful feature.

		The docs are not exposed so people don't start relying on this feature (whose interface is very likely to change in the future). It's not part of the public API. I realize the distinction isn't perfect, especially if related things are referenced in the parts of the docs that are referenced from official documentation.
This should be resolved once we publish a more mature version for these ops.

		OK, but maybe update the source code docs to point out that debug_name must have a value (or fix it so that it doesn't fail if it doesn't.) May save the adventurous among us a few hours of debugging :)

		Can you look if &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/687&gt;#687&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes the issue? Clearly, the mismatch between documentation and code is a bug.
