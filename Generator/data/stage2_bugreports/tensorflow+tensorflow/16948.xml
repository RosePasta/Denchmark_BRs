	<summary>tf.QueueBase.dequeue_many returns list instead of tuple</summary>
	<description>
The dequeue_many operation returns a list of Tensors, while the documentation states that it should be a tuple (which is more sensible).

Returns:
The tuple of concatenated tensors that was dequeued.

, I think that _dequeue_return_value was originally Matthieu's routine, but it looks like that routine is built to return a list not a tuple. Could you please comment on whether we should fix the documentation or fix the implementation, and perhaps assign someone to implement?
Marking "docs" for now.

		I don't think we can fix the implementation: although I agree it would make more sense to return a tuple here, there might be code that depends on it being a list.
In a future major version of TensorFlow, it might make sense to use the nest library to allow nested structures (including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and recursive nests of those) to be stored in a queue.
For now, we'd welcome a fix to the documentation. I'm marking it as contributions welcome, since there is nobody specific working on that API right now.

		I see, that's unfortunate but understandable. I submitted a pull request. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/16957&gt;#16957&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
