System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary on tx2. (followed this https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1038957/jetson-tx2/tensorflow-for-jetson-tx2-/)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.13.1
Python version: 3.6.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: cuda-10.0 , cudnn7.3

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
I am trying to load a model (hdf5) which has a keras custom layer.
I also see the same error when creating a keras model from scratch. Conv2D however works alright. Note I use python3. Is there a modification needed for custom layer?
However, the script fails with the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):

		I could verify the issue is encountered for both Python 2 and 3. Created a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/29567&gt;#29567&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the fix.

		Since I am running tensorflow with precompiled binaries (from Nvidia) on tx2 is there a simpler way to get your fix to my environment? Will it be necessary for me to recompile tensorflow again?
I understand you have changed the following, in file  tensorflow/python/ops/random_ops.py :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.python.framework import tensor_shape

    if isinstance(shape, (tuple, list)):
      shape = [val.value if isinstance(
          val, tensor_shape.Dimension) else val for val in shape]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can you tell me how (if possible) I can patch my tensorflow?

 Not familiar with your environment. You can modify the python script in place though it will be replaced if installed by pip again.

		These changes worked for me on Nvidia Jetson TX2. Thanks a ton &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yongtang&gt;@yongtang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
