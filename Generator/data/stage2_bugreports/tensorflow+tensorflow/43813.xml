	<summary>Buggy string concatenation in "experimental_tpu_predict_loop" and "experimental_tpu_test_loop"</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
While analyzing Tensorflow on SonarCloud I saw what looks like two errors in  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d6426459bca2971b611ca9773858e55f6cc1a9af/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training_distributed_v1.py#L536-L537&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d6426459bca2971b611ca9773858e55f6cc1a9af/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training_distributed_v1.py#L389-L390&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I put only one screenshot as the code is identical for both issues.

You can see the issues in SonarCloud &lt;denchmark-link:https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=nicolas-harraudeau-sonarsource_tensorflow&amp;issues=AXT60OurBMD9OHnI8qEF&amp;open=AXT60OurBMD9OHnI8qEF&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=nicolas-harraudeau-sonarsource_tensorflow&amp;issues=AXT60OurBMD9OHnI8qEI&amp;open=AXT60OurBMD9OHnI8qEI&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The problem is quite simple: the developer expected both strings to concatenate automatically. However as there are no parentheses nor a backslash at the end of the first line, these are two separate statements: one assignment and one string formatting which is then discarded.
In case you have any question, suggestion or if you see a False Positive on SonarCloud you can reach out on &lt;denchmark-link:https://community.sonarsource.com/&gt;SonarSource community forum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
A few notes in case you want to use SonarCloud:

I am currently testing the python analyzer so the project on SonarCloud will only show python issues, but SonarCloud can also analyze C/C++ code and other languages.
SonarCloud can also import pylint issues in case you want to use a rule SonarCloud does not already provide. Note however that pylint rules and SonarCloud rules are implemented differently. You might see new issues with SonarCloud, or less issues in some cases (we try to avoid False Positives as much as possible).
It is free for open-source projects.
