	<summary>Change TanhGrad() operation definition with respect to documentation</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
TanhGrad() documentation says: "Specifically, grad = dy * (1 - y*y), where y = tanh(x), and dy
is the corresponding input gradient." 


tensorflow/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc


         Line 323
      in
      bab2db4






 Specifically, `grad = dy * (1 - y*y)`, where `y = tanh(x)`, and `dy` 




 which is correct and looks good.
But operation has following declaration of inputs:
Input("x: T")
.Input("y: T")



tensorflow/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc


         Line 200
      in
      bab2db4






 Input("x: T")                                                \ 





what doesn't correlate with the documentated formula: grad = dy * (1 - y*y).
Could you please rename inputs with respect to documentation like this:
Input("y: T")
.Input("dy: T")
Thanks.

		This means modifying UNARY_GRADIENT_COMPLEX macro and changing x to y and y to dy for every op that uses it, are you sure that wouldn't break things/contradict documentation for those other ops? BTW, you can press "y" in github to generate a permanent link with line number reference

, it doesn't contradict documentation for other operations which use UNARY_GRADIENT_COMPLEX macros, because the other ops use 'y' and 'dy' names in docs.
Thanks for your suggestion, I updated the issue with permanent links.

 do you want to do a PR to fix it? If you do, make sure to run the tests locally first
