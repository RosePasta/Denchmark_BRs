&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It appears that the kernel of tf.reduce_sum is not registerd for GPU's if the type of the tensor to be summed is int64 (only registered for tf.int32)
Moreover the kernel of tf.tile is not registered for the case where the tensor to be tiled is of type tf.int32 (only registered for tf.int64)
Why is there this inconsistency?

		tf.tile has int32 implementation (not int64)
tf.reduce has no int* implementations. There are kernels registered on GPU with int32 but they run on CPU since in most common case the tensors are small and launching GPU kernel would be inefficient.
If you indeed need an int32 op that runs on GPU you are out of luck.
Generally, there is an inconsistency since for some ops registering an int32 gpu kernel would lead to many small  ops  being launched  on GPU.
