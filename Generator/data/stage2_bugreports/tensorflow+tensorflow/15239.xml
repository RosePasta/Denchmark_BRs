&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 x64
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4
Bazel version: N/A
Python version: None

GPU model and memory: None
Exact command to reproduce: -

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It seems there is no gradient defined for the Pow operation in the C++ API.
I am actually transferring this issue from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp/issues/187&gt;migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp#187&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Similar to the case of Select (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/14845&gt;#14845&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), it seems there is also no gradient for the Pow operation in the C++ API.

		Huge thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facaiy&gt;@facaiy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! Also I've just noticed that I used the wrong title for the issue, probably it seemed confusing at first. Sorry about it, and thanks again for the extremely fast PR!

		Is this issue fixed now. Because i get the same error with 1.9
C++/C# Tensorflow is useles if you want to build your model.
