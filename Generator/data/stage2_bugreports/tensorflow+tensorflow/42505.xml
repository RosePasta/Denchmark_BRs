	<summary>Custom Constraint not working</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
If I use custom constraint as kernel_constraint when I create a model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(y.shape[1], activation='softplus',
                                             kernel_constraint=SumConstraint(axis=0),
                                             # kernel_constraint=keras.constraints.MinMaxNorm(),
                                             bias_constraint=keras.constraints.MinMaxNorm(min_value=-100,
                                                                                          max_value=100),
                                             input_shape=[x.shape[1]])])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I always got this ValueError: Unknown constraint: SumConstraint.
Even if I use the same class as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ymodak&gt;@ymodak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 showed or use the example in document &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/api/layers/constraints/&gt;https://keras.io/api/layers/constraints/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		It seems like both v2.2 and v2.3 can work well on &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/OnlyBelter/31fc0f61dd94117d170111bb50236197&gt;colab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but both versions cannot work on windows 10.
So I think this may a problem depends on operation system.

		I find this error showed when I try to load model instead of create model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = keras.models.load_model('model_reg.h5', compile=False)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Even if I set  to False or pass  like this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/5916&gt;issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said or this question &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/57985788/2803344&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/57985788/2803344&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I ran your code in Windows10, and I see the following output. It didn't throw any error as you mentioned. Thanks!

 As mentioned above, I cannot reproduce the error in my Windows10 desktop. Thanks!
Please verify and close the issue if this was already resolved for you. Thanks!

		Can you load saved model, like below:
model = keras.models.load_model('model_reg.h5', compile=False)
I can train model, but cannot load pre-trained model.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OnlyBelter&gt;@OnlyBelter&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I was able to load the saved model after adding  argument as shown below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# saved model as follows
model.save('model_reg.h5',save_format='h5')

# loaded the model as shown below
model = keras.models.load_model('model_reg.h5', compile=False,custom_objects={'SoftMax':SoftMax})
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It runs in Windows10 as well as in colab.
Please verify once and close the issue. Thanks!
