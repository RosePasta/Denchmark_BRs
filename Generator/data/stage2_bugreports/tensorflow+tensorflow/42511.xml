		We tried to migrate to the latest versions without using nightly builds and it helped.
"org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.3.0"
"org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu:2.3.0"
Let's close this issue in this case.

		I had a similar issue where the GpuDelegate() constructor was sometimes throwing a "cannot locate symbol" error for  and  when running on Android 11.  I switched from 1.14.0 to 2.3.0 of the  and  libraries, and the error seems to have gone away now.  Thanks for the suggestion, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Nublo&gt;@Nublo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
