	<summary>micro: port op SPACE_TO_BATCH_ND from lite</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/teams/micro&gt;@tensorflow/micro&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This issue tracks my work porting operator SPACE_TO_BATCH_ND from lite to micro.
The port will be submitted in a number of PRs. Here's a rough flight plan in the style of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/45306&gt;#45306&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
PR 1: Extract the code for parsing the op from a flatbuffer out of ParseOpDataTfLite in tensorflow/lite/core/api/flatbuffer_conversions.cc into a standalone function that can be called from micro's op resolver
PR 2: Extract the reference implementation out of tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h into its own header which can be included without dragging in reference_ops.h's dependences
PR 3: Copy operator from lite to micro without making any changes or including in the build
PR 4: Delete extra code from the micro copy of the operator
PR 5: Port micro copy of operator as necessary and add a corresponding test
