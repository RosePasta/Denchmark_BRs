	<summary>[TF 2.0 API Docs] tf.math.acos</summary>
	<description>
System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/math/acos

Describe the documentation issue
Documentation for tf.math.acos is created from a generated file, python/ops/gen_math_ops.py. It would be excellent to have a link to the files that are used to generate gen_math_ops.py - so a user could make modifications quickly, without having to search through tensorflow/tensorflow.
 could use a clear description, usage examples, and example visuals. A great template to model this on could be &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.arccos.html&gt;numpy.arccos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Users also experience obfuscated errors from unexpected arguments (ex: strings, Booleans, and even just s). Some examples are shared below. The file used to generate this error is located &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e1d20b3b4f25047679cf34107f8d87329cc9070f/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/eager/execute.cc#L201&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. All  operations and the operations they influence (e.g., ) would experience these same obfuscated XLA errors.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InvalidArgumentError: Invalid cast from floating point type to S32 in ConstantR0WithType.
	 [[{{node Acos}}]] [Op:Acos]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InternalError: Could not find valid device for node.
Node: {{node Acos}}
All kernels registered for op Acos :
  device='XLA_CPU'; T in [DT_FLOAT, DT_DOUBLE, DT_INT32, DT_COMPLEX64, DT_INT64, DT_COMPLEX128, DT_HALF]
  device='XLA_CPU_JIT'; T in [DT_FLOAT, DT_DOUBLE, DT_INT32, DT_COMPLEX64, DT_INT64, DT_COMPLEX128, DT_HALF]
  device='CPU'; T in [DT_DOUBLE]
  device='CPU'; T in [DT_FLOAT]
 [Op:Acos]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
I shall certainly try! :)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dynamicwebpaige&gt;@dynamicwebpaige&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I searched through the tensorflow repo, and it looks like one needs to edit the .pbtxt files inside  to modify the documentation. Can you confirm this?

 The  file is generated from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl&gt;tensorflow.bzl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The C++ code located &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 defines documentation for each math op -- an example of how to modify the description via  can be found &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc#L531&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to keep me honest, though! Do we have a recommended process for updating those docs?

 Just confirmed that you are correct! Apologies for the confusion - the files in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/9590c4c32dd4346ea5c35673336f5912c6072bf2/tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api&gt;/base_api&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 still create the documentation for several of the TF 2.0 math endpoints.
Let me take a look at your PR; we might need to tweak the syntax a little bit (format is a special flavor of markdown). Check out &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/9590c4c32dd4346ea5c35673336f5912c6072bf2/tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api/api_def_Pow.pbtxt&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 endpoint for a usage example.

, that's great! Please take your time to review the PR, I'll be happy to work on any changes that are necessary. 
I seem to understand how to modify the API docs now. I can work on other similar issues as well.

Created 5 PRs covering some of the math functions. Working on other functions.

 are there any ops left to do

		Just a note for people working on this: if you add python doctests, please make sure to do so in Python files, not in base_api/api_def files as those are the APIs for other languages too.

		Looks like the changes made to tf.math.acos and tf.math.add were not merged with the previous PRs. I have opened a new PR to address this. Since this is my first PR I'm limiting the number of changes I make to only the .pbtxt files. Once I get this sorted out I will begin to modify .Docs in math_ops.cc to reflect the changes.

 solved this
The &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/acos?version=nightly&gt;nightly version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has updated docstring.
