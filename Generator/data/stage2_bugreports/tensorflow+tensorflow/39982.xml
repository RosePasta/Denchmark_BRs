Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
Issue:
return math_ops.maximum(0., neg - pos + 1.)
lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/gen_math_ops.py:5740 maximum
"Maximum", x=x, y=y, name=name)
lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/op_def_library.py:506 _apply_op_helper
inferred_from[input_arg.type_attr]))
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: Input 'y' of 'Maximum' Op has type float16 that does not match type float32 of argument 'x'.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Plausible solution:
return math_ops.maximum( neg - pos + 1., 0.)
So that dtype is matched with calculated entity rather than other way.

 ,
I checked the mentioned thread, it shows the error dtype missmatch for tf 2.0. It was same for me, but this issue is in 2.2.0. Sorry that I haven't mentioned this before.
