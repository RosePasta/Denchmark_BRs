	<summary>Exporting a TF Estimator with a `hub.text_embedding_column_v2` does not include the pretrained model</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): AI Platform runtime 2.3 or Google Colab
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip

Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A

This issue has been observed with the estimator API only, not Keras. I'm not entirely sure if it's a problem with estimator, export, or a tf hub issue.
Describe the current behavior
When exporting a TF Estimator which uses a hub.text_embedding_column_v2 (the new version of tf-hub's text_embedding_column_v2 that supports pretrained models in TF 2 SavedModel format), the export directory does not include the pretrained model asset files. Instead, the model seems to reference the local path the model was trained with.
When text_embedding_column_v2 is fed with a url (i.e. tfhub.dev/../my-model), the model references the cached local path.
When the local path doesn't exist anymore, or when using the exported model in a different machine altogether, calling tf.saved_model.load fails with a FileNotFound exception:
When defining the embedding column with a local path to the pretrained model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; ...
 hub.text_embedding_column_v2('/home/.../my-local-model')
 ...
 estimator = ...
 ...
 tf.estimator.export_saved_model(...)

...
 # on another machine or when removing /home/.../my-local-model:
...
tf.saved_model.load(...)

NotFoundError:  /content/local_nnlm50_2/assets/tokens.txt; No such file or directory

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When defining the embedding column with a cached pretrained model from a tfhub.dev url (not reproducible in Colab since tf hub cache doesn't kick in there):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; ...
 hub.text_embedding_column_v2('https://tfhub.dev/google/nnlm-en-dim50/2')
 ...
 estimator = ...
 ...
 tf.estimator.export_saved_model(...)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
The expected behavior is for the export directory to include the pretrained model's assets, like it does when using hub.text_embedding_column (v1) with TF 1 format modules. And more importantly: loading the exported estimators should not fail even when loaded in a different machine, as well as not when the original local path to the pretrained model doesn't exist anymore.
The entire exported estimator should be contained within the export directory.

Here's a Colab replicating the issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tr5M0m_EVRd5sFdgDX-EbVsk47UokPxD?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tr5M0m_EVRd5sFdgDX-EbVsk47UokPxD?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Overview of Colab:

Download both versions of nnlm50 to local (TF 1 module, TF 2 SavedModel)
Define two estimators: one with text_embedding_column (v1) and the local TF 1 format pretrained model, and the other with text_embedding_column_v2 and the local TF 2 format pretrained model
Train and export the estimators to SavedModels
Print contents of export dir: TF 1 format has the nnlm50 assets, TF 2 format does not
Try to load both estimators from disk: success
Delete both local nnlm50 directories used for training the estimators
Try to load the v1 estimator from disk again: success
Try to load the v2 estimator from disk again: fails

diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

TensorFlow Hub issues are tracked in tensorflow/hub repo. Could you please submit a new issue from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/issues/new&gt;this link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and fill in the template, so that we can track the issue there. Thanks!

Thanks for looking into this. I'll gladly post on tf/hub, but just noting I'm not 100% sure this is a tf hub issue and not an estimator issue (I trust your intuition though). I posted here because the issue manifests when using the estimator API, but not when using the Keras API.

I was able to reproduce the error with TF v2.3 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/9b3027743ad936469e62f289f327c949/46371-2-4.ipynb&gt;TF v2.4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, the issue seems to be fixed with the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/82de81ae4a654f9928c7d3136ba69fa8/46371-tf-nightly.ipynb&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I was able to run the code without any errors. Please checked the linked gist for reference. Thanks!

		Looks good to me &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/amahendrakar&gt;@amahendrakar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
Pretty sure &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6d8366afc435eb0f78d5abff457db26b68f0183d#diff-85d1ba3be0fd0e98ce033a07237e1f76c61058ce93e0f1e12e58a3c61b9291d5&gt;this is the commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that fixed it.
saved_model/load.py is being called by hub.KerasLayer. So it was a tensorflow issue after all :)
Thanks for looking into it! Closing
