	<summary>Saving model with tf.keras.layers.RNN and stateful=True with save_format='tf' fails</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device if the issue happens on mobile device: -
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version: 2.2.0-dev20200228
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: CPU only
GPU model and memory: CPU only

Describe the current behavior
Saving a tf.keras.Sequential model with tf.keras.layers.RNN and stateful=True with save_format=tf fails.
Describe the expected behavior
Saving should succeed.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf

number_of_cells = 2

model = tf.keras.Sequential()

model.add(tf.keras.layers.Input(batch_input_shape=(1, 1, 1)))

cells = []

for _ in range(number_of_cells):
    cells.append(tf.keras.layers.GRUCell(10))

model.add(tf.keras.layers.RNN(cells, stateful=True))

model.compile()

model.save('rnn.tf', save_format='tf')

model2 = tf.keras.models.load_model('rnn.tf')
Other info / logs
Saving succeeds with save_format='h5'.
Traceback in case of failure:

		I have tried on colab with TF Nightly version and was able to reproduce the issue. Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/e38aae55dc2b68e5852c2524e2d2b02c/untitled700.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
