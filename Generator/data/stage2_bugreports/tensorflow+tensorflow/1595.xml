	<summary>using tensor as bool in cifar10 example</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I have just recompiled TF to commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f952246b1756242926d47091d09ceb7c7b963269&gt;f952246&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and got an error on cifar10 example. Line  should be updated to  due to recent changes. Just minor stuff.
