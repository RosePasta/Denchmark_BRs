System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Jupyter Nodebook of a official kubeflow image
gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-2.1.0-notebook-gpu:1.0.0 on my kubeflow platform.
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0-gpu
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):gcc (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: release 10.1, V10.1.243, but I can't find cuDNN libraries using a command cat /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h | grep CUDNN_MAJOR -A 2
GPU model and memory: T4 / 16G

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"


In my notebook having 4 GPUs, I ran a MirroredStrategy Keras example documented in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/keras&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and all GPUs's memories are occupied, but after printing below logs it hangs.

		Hi - I am a little confused - you pasted 2 logs in the original issue description. one seems to be the hanging case and one seems to be the working case. Is that right? If so, what is the difference between the two?
Also, is it possible to test with the latest TF nightly?
I also see some profiler related errors in your logs (CUPTI_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES), but I am not sure if those are related to the hanging at all or not.. likely not.

 Sorry for the confusion.
All logs I pasted are the hanging case,
first in  section is container's STDOUT,
the other in  is outputs printed on nodebook.
All logs were captured at the same time, the hanging case.
I will test with the latest TF nightly, and post the result here soon.

		Thanks for clarifying &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jazzsir&gt;@jazzsir&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . In order to help narrow down the issue can you try 2 things:

remove all callbacks and try  (to see if the issue is with checkpointing or tensorboard etc)
try strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(cross_device_ops=tf.distribute. ReductionToOneDevice()) - this is to check whether NCCL is the culprit.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jvishnuvardhan&gt;@jvishnuvardhan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,Yes, that’s right. Thanks
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guptapriya&gt;@guptapriya&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, after replacing cross_device_ops with ReductionToOneDevice(), it works, NCCL is the culprit, is there any way to fix NCCL on GCP? Thanks.

		<comment id='10' author='jazzsir' date='2020-05-03T05:08:22Z'>
		Hm, I remember on GCP there may sometimes be issues when 4 GPUs are used. Can you perhaps try using 8 GPUs and see if you still see the problem?
I will meanwhile also try to check with someone from GCP.

 sorry for my late response, I finally found it!, actually I ran the Strategy on my Kubeflow platform where Istio controls traffic and istio-proxy sidecar cut off NCCL communication.
I appreciate everything you've done for me so far.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/davidrpugh&gt;@davidrpugh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thanks, I checked, but it's because of istio-proxy.

		If ISTIO is causing problems you can add the annotation to your pods
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To disable istio sidecar injection.
