	<summary>[TF 2.2 API docs] tf.keras.applications.resnet_v2.preprocess_input docs Returns paragraph is misleading</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/resnet_v2/preprocess_input&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The documentation says in the 'Returns' paragraph that

The images are converted from RGB to BGR, then each color channel is zero-centered with respect to the ImageNet dataset, without scaling.

However, according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/2b96f3662bd776e277f86997659e61046b56c315/tensorflow/python/keras/applications/resnet_v2.py#L125-L139&gt;the function definition&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it's not true anymore  since the  can't be set and it is always equal to .
Therefore, this docs part must be corrected to

will scale pixels between -1 and 1,  sample-wise
