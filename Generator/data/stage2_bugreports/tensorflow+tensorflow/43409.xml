	<summary>In load_model method: Input 'values' passed int64 expected int32</summary>
	<description>
System information


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):


OS Platform and Distribution:  Linux Ubuntu 20.04 and kaggle


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source


TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.0


Python version:3.7


Describe the current behavior
I have trained a model with custom loss and after save, I tried to load it but got this error
2 errors while building NodeDef 'tf_op_layer_stack_2/stack_2' using Op&lt;name=Pack; signature=values:N*T -&gt; output:T; attr=N:int,min=1; attr=T:type; attr=axis:int,default=0&gt;:
Input 'values' passed int64 expected int32
Inconsistent values for attr 'T' DT_INT32 vs. DT_INT64
Describe the expected behavior
It should be loaded without any error

,
I was able to reproduce the error with TF v2.3.
However, the error seems to be resolved with the latest TF-nightly. I was able to run the code without any issues, please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/de5cf5d0b19a87f2f79b61642fec4ad0/43409-tf-nightly.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!
