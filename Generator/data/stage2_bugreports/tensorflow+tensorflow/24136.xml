	<summary>AttributeError: 'OneDeviceStrategy' object has no attribute 'call_for_each_tower'</summary>
	<description>
I downloaded the up-to-date source code from this page and build from source. Then I tried to train mnist using the code in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/mnist&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/mnist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I got the following error message:

But if I install from tf-nightly from binary, it can be trained. Please help out!Thanks.

		I got the same issue when run NCF in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/recommendation&gt;tensorflow-models&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and I has already know that is caused by mismatching API between tensorflow and tensorflow-estimator.
TF deleted this API  and used  instead, but the release package of &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-estimator/#history&gt;tensorflow-estimator&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is too old(release on Sep, 12, 2018) that still used the old API.
Tensorflow-estimator has already changed this API in their master, but they didn't release any new package and I didn't find somewhere to submit the issue, so I just answered this issue and hope someone can help to release a new estimator.

		Note that master of the Official Models should run against the nightly releases, so using tensorflow-nightly in this case (or tensorflow-estimator-nightly if you want to install estimator independently) is the expected behavior. We are currently not cutting releases for the Official Models, but may do so again in the future (CC &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lintian06&gt;@lintian06&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )
I will close this as the mismatched build seems to be the problem; please reopen as necessary.

		I got the same error when going through TensorFlow Keras guide to the last snippet on colab.
