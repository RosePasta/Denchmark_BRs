	<summary>Extra metric added to model.metrics in TF 2.2</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Ubuntu 18.04 (running on Colab)

N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Running on Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below):
2.2.0-rc2
Python version:
3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
Running on Colab
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
Running on Colab
CUDA/cuDNN version:
No GPU
GPU model and memory:
No GPU

Describe the current behavior
When I compile my model with model.compile(..., metrics=["mae"]) I end up with an extra metric in the first position. This breaks my existing code (for example when accessing model.metrics[0], now I get another metric than the one that was excepted).
Describe the expected behavior
When I compile the model with N metrics, I expect model.metrics to return a list with N metrics, not 1+N.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
You can run the following code in &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yKy-TC5PyE6ImQemE89SDSiQkFniXIcb&gt;this colab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model = keras.models.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation="relu", input_shape=[10]),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer="sgd", metrics=["mae", "mse"])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2)

assert len(model.metrics) == 2
The assertion fails.
Other info / logs
This may be related to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/37990&gt;#37990&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , but it feels more severe.
There's another behavior change that really confuses me: the model.metrics list is empty until model.fit() is called.
In short, model.metrics seems really broken and unintuitive now.

, I think there is always one matrix corresponding to loss and there will extra as many as arguments passed in .
You can check their names with .
In your example there will be three metrics first for , second for  and third for .
Hope it helps you.

		Was able to reproduce the issue. Please find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/d7806dd77e70c4bb2dcaa00914f11012/38150.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The refactor breaks strike again...
Good luck.

 This was an intended change which was part of a refactor as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/briannemsick&gt;@briannemsick&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned. I have updated the docs for metrics in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a822fa93da3f8e2484df2d030ddbef24b06cbe07&gt;a822fa9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Model loss and output losses are now tracked as part of metrics. Earlier metrics_names included model loss and output losses but the metrics property did not. Now they are consistent.
Thank you!
