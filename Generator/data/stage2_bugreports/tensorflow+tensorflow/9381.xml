	<summary>Mac Gpu Link not working?</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I was trying to install Tensorflow for Mac GPU Python 3 one from github and I found that it is a broken URL Giving me an HTTP 404 Error.
The URL is - https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-matrix-mac-gpu/TF_BUILD_IS_OPT=OPT,TF_BUILD_IS_PIP=PIP,TF_BUILD_PYTHON_VERSION=PYTHON3,label=gpu-mac/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/pip_test/whl/tensorflow_gpu-1.1.0rc2-py3-none-any.whl
Please Fix the Url.
Best,
Daksh

		Where did you copy that URL from?

		From the readme of Tensorflow's Github.

		I was wondering about this as well.
Looks like the build for nightly Mac GPU Python 3 is currently broken, and for this reason link to the last successful build of nightly Mac GPU Python 3 version 1.1.0 is broken. Same issue with nightly Mac GPU Python 2 1.1.0 link and build.
