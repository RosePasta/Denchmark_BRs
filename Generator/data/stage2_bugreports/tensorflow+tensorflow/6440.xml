	<summary>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'legacy_seq2sec'</summary>
	<description>
In Tensorflow 0.12.0 &amp;&amp; python 2.7.10  When I run :
ptb_word_lm.py --data_path=/Users/mac/Documents/Tensor/simple-examples/data/ --model small
It throws such exception:

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'legacy_seq2sec'

How can I fix this issue?

		I got the same problem and have no idea.
And I can not find legacy_seq2sec in API r0.12. Is this api removed?

, could this be related to your migrations? Could you fix the instructions to flex this if so.

		I tried this out with the current master version of TensorFlow and with r0.12, and they both worked for me.
Make sure you are either building TensorFlow from the master version of the repository and running the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/rnn/ptb&gt;code in the models repo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or running TensorFlow r0.12 with the r0.12 version of the model (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/0.12.1&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/0.12.1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in tensorflow/models/rnn/ptb).

		If it's still not working after that, feel free to reopen this.
