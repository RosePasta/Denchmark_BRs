Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Used Google Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.0
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: Doesn't matter
GPU model and memory: Doesn't matter

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
I used to run below mentioned code in the tensorflow version 1.15 but since the time I have upgraded it fails to run.
I have already gone through similar bugs, but they all mention that I should have provided the input shape, I have done that, so I am not sure where the problem lies.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = DenseNet121(input_shape=(810, 1440, 3),
                                         include_top=False,
                                         weights='imagenet'
                                         )

depth = model.get_output_shape_at(0)[-1]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Expected behaviour should be that I should be able to get the output shape of the last layer.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Everyone can recreate the issue using the below colab link.

		Can you unlock the Colab?

		Yes, I just unlocked it for everyone - &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TPYkETG8szsCvut6SdzY345jEnqOrgsg?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TPYkETG8szsCvut6SdzY345jEnqOrgsg?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		You need to call the model with an input:
E.g.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model(tf.keras.Input((810, 1440, 3)))
depth = model.get_output_shape_at(0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		But, if you have observed, when I am initializing the densenet model, I am providing the input shape.
Then why do I need to provide it two times?

		The layer need to be called. See the difference between  and  &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/api/layers/base_layer/&gt;https://keras.io/api/layers/base_layer/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
