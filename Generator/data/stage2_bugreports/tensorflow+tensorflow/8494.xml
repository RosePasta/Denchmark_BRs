	<summary>Segfault: "Check failed: num_elements_ &amp;lt;= kMaxElements"</summary>
	<description>
I'm running the current nightly build as of today (2017-03-17). I'm working with very large, sparse matrices, and my program seems to have hit a variable overflow. It crashed with the following log entry:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2017-03-17 10:48:34.554715: F tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc:212] Check failed: num_elements_ &lt;= kMaxElements (1141286132736 vs. 1099511627776)
Aborted (core dumped)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm guessing this is because my sparse matrix is too large to handle for tensorflow. It would be great if this could somehow be fixed. Please refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7783&gt;#7783&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more details about my code (that was another overflow issue I encountered).

		Looks like we can just bump that limit up, I'll work on getting that checked in.

 beat me to it. There's a patch in review, one of us will update this issue once it's checked in.
