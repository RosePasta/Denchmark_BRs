	<summary>tf.io.matching_files hangs given a certain pattern</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): No
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.2.0-rc4-8-g2b96f3662b 2.2.0
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A

Describe the current behavior
tf.io.matching_files hangs and does not terminate when passing /* or /?  in the beginning of pattern argument.
Describe the expected behavior
As far as /* or /? is not placed in the beginning, the function terminates with a proper error handling. I would expect a similar behavior for my input below.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf

tf.io.matching_files('/*name',name=None)
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		I have tried in colab with TF version 2.2, nightly version and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/1145726bc641ac37372231cf6d7866d3/untitled42.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

		The reason for this problem is the algorithm in tf.io.matching_files will search for all files and nested directories under / when /*name is used. I'd love to help to fix this problem.

		This is fixed in latest nightly (probably even from before)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;...$ python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.io.gfile.glob('/*p'))"
['/tmp']
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
