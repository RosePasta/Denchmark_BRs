	<summary>data input into model.fit() for multiple dense(2,)  layers</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def func(img_batch, lb_batch):
  lbs = tf.one_hot(lb_batch,depth=2)
  return img_batch, lbs

train_Data = train_ds.map(func)

model.fit(train_Data,steps_per_epoch=400,validation_steps=40,
                    epochs=50,verbose=1))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Error:
The model is expecting a 2 separate arrays , but the custom funtion return single array with shape (2,2).
Here the lbs in func is retrun single array with shape (2,2), how can i make the lb into seperate array with each having shape (1,2)?

I ran the above shared code, its incomplete hence i &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/e51869bb8cbc7b062aca0256c6149de9/untitled284.ipynb&gt;face a different error&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, please share all dependencies and complete indented code and tf version such that we can replicate the issue faced or a colab gist with the error to analyse. Thanks!
