	<summary>[Bug] embedding_lookup_sparse divide by zero when use mean combiner</summary>
	<description>
I come across this issue with TF==1.14.
I found this bug was fixed in this PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/21757&gt;#21757&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
However, when I checked the implementations in 1.13, 1.14 and 1.15 I found all of them implemented as following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;elif combiner == "mean":
        embeddings = math_ops.segment_sum(embeddings, segment_ids)
        weight_sum = math_ops.segment_sum(weights, segment_ids)
        embeddings = math_ops.div(embeddings, weight_sum, name=name)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Should this be fixed with math_ops. div_no_nan  ?

		Please note,I have found the same issue for code in TF 2.x as well.

 Please take a look at this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/21757#issuecomment-416835941&gt;comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 i.e.,
in the documentation of  its mentioned that 
So, due to this, the change has not been merged.

 Even though this is true, the sum of weights can also be zero.
I come across this problem because I want to embed user actions on items. Some people don't have any action on items. So for these users, I can only set , . With the current implementation, it will divide by 0.

 Can you please share a reproducible test case where the sum of weights are zero. Thanks!

 Just now I found this issue can be solved with  (tested with 1.14.0, I think the same for the other versions).  Here're the code snippets for reproducing.
import tensorflow as tf

E = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
ids = tf.SparseTensor([[0,0]], np.array([0], dtype='int64'), dense_shape=[1,1])
weights = tf.SparseTensor([[0,0]], [0.0], dense_shape=[1,1])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse(E, ids, weights, combiner='mean')))
# ouput: [[nan nan nan]]

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(tf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse(E, ids, weights, combiner='mean')))

# output: [[0. 0. 0.]]
