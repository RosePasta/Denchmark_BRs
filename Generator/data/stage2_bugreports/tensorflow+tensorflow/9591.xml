		This question is better asked on  &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it is not a  bug or feature request. There is also a larger community that reads questions there. Please also include more information on what commands you ran to produce the output. Thanks!

 Thanks for reply. I know it's not a product bug, but it's a doc bug. The README.md doc has several invalid site links, i don't think this should be asked in StackOverflow.

		Ah sorry, didn't read the issue closely enough!

		Hm, the "Installing Tensorflow" link at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 goes to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and the "Community" link goes to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Am I missing something?

		Yes, you are right. But the two links redirect to invalid sites with a "" result in my environment.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 redirects to
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/install/index.html&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/install/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 redirects to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/community/index.html&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/community/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

btw: I'm in China, hope this helps.

 does this ring any bells for you? (See the above comment.) Those links don't redirect for me, but I'm not sure if being in China should affect this.

		It seems like you might be accessing an old version of the site somehow. I'll ping our infrastructure team to see if they can look into this. In the meantime, if you have access to the github, you can look at the docs source directly:
Installation page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/install/index.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/install/index.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Community page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/community/index.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/community/index.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

All the non-API pages should be in that docs_src directory, and the documentation for individual API methods, classes, etc. is generated from the docstrings in the source files. Let me know if you need help finding something.
