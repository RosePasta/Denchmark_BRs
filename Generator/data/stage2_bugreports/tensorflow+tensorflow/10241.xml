	<summary>C++ Online Documentation codeblocks not formatting</summary>
	<description>
There are some codeblocks in C++ documentation , written with github-style fenced markdown,
that are not rendering as &lt;code&gt;.
Eg: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/depth-to-space&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/depth-to-space&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5127634/26518496/5c312d9e-42e4-11e7-856a-972268bcf757.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It looks like something is going wrong with the site generation,
that when translating markdown, it does not pickup these blocks.
In the pages I quickly checked it seems to occur in the Summary sections, eg in:

https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/depth-to-space
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/batch-to-space
https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/batch-to-space-n-d

		This is happening in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/depth-to-space&gt;1.2 docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 too.

 Any idea why we're not rendering the code blocks in our C++ ops documentation?

		Maybe triple ``` should be single ` ?

: These are rendering correctly in the python docs (singles are for inline, triples are for blocks).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/depth_to_space&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/depth_to_space&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jart&gt;@jart&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: I'm not very familiar with that section of the docs pipeline, I'll find the right person.

		The document is in tensorflow\core\ops\array_ops.cc, I am willing to fix this, should we remove all  ```  as python API: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/depth_to_space&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/depth_to_space&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
Thanks

		If you remove the ``` you need to indent 4 spaces so we parse it as Markdown regardless, otherwise it will still render poorly.
I think we have an internal bug open to do some processing to the C++ docs regardless, however.

		so this issue will be fixed after the internal bug fixed, right?

		I'm trying to figure out the state of this, but I think Mark's still working on the backticks bug?  It still looks like the issue is happening in our C++ docs.
