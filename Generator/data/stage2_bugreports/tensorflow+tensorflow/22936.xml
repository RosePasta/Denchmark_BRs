I had converted a h5 file to pb file, then while loading the pb file I get the following error.
Traceback (most recent call last):

This is an internal bug, please file a bug report with instructions on how to reproduce the error.
Have I written custom code - No, forked from - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GustavZ/Mobile_Mask_RCNN&gt;https://github.com/GustavZ/Mobile_Mask_RCNN&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

OS Platform and Distribution- linux ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from - using pip
Bazel version- N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version- N/A
GPU model and memory- N/A
Exact command to reproduce - convert the h5 file to pb and then load the pb file
Mobile device - N/A

		Hi, sorry for the delay. This looks like a control flow bug, which we're currently reimplementing (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180507-cond-v2.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180507-cond-v2.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180821-differentiable-functional-while.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180821-differentiable-functional-while.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for details).
Would you mind running your code with the following environment variables set:
TF_ENABLE_WHILE_V2=1 TF_ENABLE_COND_V2=1
Please report any errors you get with these env variables set. Thanks!
