	<summary>Process hanging when using TF_SessionRun with multiple times the same input</summary>
	<description>
It seems that if the same input appears multiple times in the inputs argument of TF_SessionRun (from c_api.h) then the TF_SessionRun call never returns.
This issue can be reproduced by modifying c_api_test.cc and replacing the line:
csession.SetInputs({{feed, Int32Tensor(3)}});
With:
csession.SetInputs({{feed, Int32Tensor(3)}, {feed, Int32Tensor(3)}});
According to gdb, the process is waiting for a mutex in the RunState destructor from DirectSession.

		In general the C API is unforgiving when it comes to usage, but this should be an easy and cheap piece of validation code to add.
