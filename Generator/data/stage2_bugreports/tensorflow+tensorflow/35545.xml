	<summary>Signal module import</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0
Python version: 3.6.8

Describe the current behavior
The signal module is not found  when doing from tensorflow.signal.
I have this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-1-89a7b2fbc883&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
----&gt; 1 from tensorflow.signal import fft2d

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.signal'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
I would like from tensorflow.signal to work.
Code to reproduce the issue
from tensorflow.signal import fft2d, ifft2d
Other info / logs
In version 1.14 this was working.
Also I can still do the following:
import tensorflow as tf
fft2d = tf.signal.fft2d
ifft2d = tf.signal.ifft2d
but it's obviously not very handy.
I also had opened an &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59116928/how-do-i-import-the-fft2d-in-tensorflow-2-0-0&gt;SO question&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but it didn't get a lot of attention.

		I was able to replicate the issue for TF-2.0,nightly and 2.1rc2 versions. Please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/oanush/033f20bb27aa23571af02a5339af6422/35545.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Importing modules in signal can be done in a way given below.
from tensorflow.python.ops.signal.fft_ops import fft2d, ifft2d
For more info please refer to the following &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.0/tensorflow/python/ops/signal/signal.py&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Sure, thanks!
I am satisfied with this answer which works in all the versions of tensorflow, but do you know why I need to use this heavy statement rather than tensorflow.signal?
