	<summary>module 'tensorflow.python.keras.utils.generic_utils' has no attribute 'populate_dict_with_module_objects'</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,

the function populate_dict_with_module_objects() is missed in the 2.2.0rc2
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: - Bazel
version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from
source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
script
You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)" 2. TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

		the code is simply not there compared with the code on github.
I means that the codes installed by "  pip install tensorflow==2.2.0rc2"

		I am also experiencing this issue. I am still very new to tf. I was running throught some tutorials. VS Code stops at the 'import tensorflow' line and returns the error:
module 'tensorflow.python.keras.utils.generic_utils' has no attribute 'populate_dict_with_module_objects'
This exact script was working BEFORE I installed CUDA drivers, but sent a warning saying it could not find the 'cuart64_101.dll'. After installing the drivers, it states that the dll was found, then immediately errors at the import.
All software is the most recent versions:
tensorflow 2.2.0rc4
cuda 10.2.89

		It worked for me after uninstalling the tf-nightly packages.
pip list | grep tf
Then reinstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow --upgrade --force-reinstall

This worked for me!! Thank you! Not sure what tf-nightly is or if I will want it later, but for now 'weeee'

		I have the same issue since tried the NMT which is required ft_nightly, so it mays conflict with tf. First uninstall tf_nightly and then force reinstall tf.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip uninstall tf-nightly
pip install tensorflow --upgrade --force-reinstall
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I'm having this issue and uninstalling tf-nightly
and forcing reinstall of tensorflow is not helping.
Any other ideas please folks?
Edit:
There may be more than one "tf-nightly" module.
After this step:
pip list | grep tf
check the list, on my machine there was a module named tf-nightly, and also one called tf-estimate-nightly
after pip uninstalling both modules, the method mentioned above worked

		I have tried to force upgrade tensorflow 2.2.0 and I am landing in same issue.

Any help here is appreciated to help fix this issue.

		I am having the same problem.
It worked fine, then I downloaded CUDA, CuDNN and tensorflow gpu and now i get this error.
I do not have tf-nightly installed.
