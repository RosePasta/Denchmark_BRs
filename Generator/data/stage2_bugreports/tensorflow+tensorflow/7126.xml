	<summary>No module named tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
System: macos sierra
Python 3.5.2 via anaconda, a special env tensorflow created and used (source activate tensorflow)
Here is how I installed the package:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.12.1-py3-none-any.whl
  pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

pip says all packages have been successfully installed, but if I try to import tensorflow, python says there is no such module.
It seems the module is named tensorflow_gpu:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(tensorflow) kaiyin@kaiyins-mbp 13:19:02 | ~ =&gt;
pip show tensorflow
(tensorflow) kaiyin@kaiyins-mbp 13:19:09 | ~ =&gt;
pip show tensorflow_gpu
Name: tensorflow-gpu
Version: 0.12.1
Summary: TensorFlow helps the tensors flow
Home-page: http://tensorflow.org/
Author: Google Inc.
Author-email: opensource@google.com
License: Apache 2.0
Location: /Users/kaiyin/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.5/site-packages
Requires: wheel, numpy, protobuf, six
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Although tensorflow_gpu couldn't be imported, either.
Any idea what's going on here?

 this could be a message produced by Python package loader because it can't find the packages, or it can be caused by  crashing with an exception. One way to tell which one it is, is to run under strace (sudo dtruss on Mac), and see what files it's opening, and that it eventually opens TensorFlow files from the correct site-packages directory

		I did a few things:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install ipython
cd /usr/local/cuda/lib
ln -s libcuda.dylib libcuda.1.dylib
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And now I can load tensorflow without a problem. Not sure which of the above solved it.

		It's the pip install ipython line. If you don't install ipython, then using ipython from your env will use ipython from outside your env, and hence switch the load paths to be outside of your env (hence no tensorflow)
This issue has been diagnosed by an earlier user who updated documentation to help future users avoid this problem in

		&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;The same problem in Windows 7.
Everything works well before the test command, "import tensorflow as tf".
