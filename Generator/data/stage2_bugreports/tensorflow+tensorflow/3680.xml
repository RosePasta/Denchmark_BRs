I was installing TF from source like I always did but I'm having the following issue this time when running bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg I got
~/python/tensorflow$ bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg

error: can't copy 'tensorflow/models/embedding/gen_word2vec.py': doesn't exist or not a regular file
plus, I can't find that file anywhere... did anything change or am I missing something?

 Do we have a pip czar?  We don't have one listed in the spreadsheet.

		That looks like a build dependency is missing: pip_package should depend on that gen_word2vec.py file, but doesn't. PRs welcome.

 Hi Eder, it worked in my Mac with OSX 10.11.6. What is your environment? Did you successfully run the "bazel run"? Which version of bazel are you using?

I'm using ubuntu 14.04 and the GPU is a K80. I ran ./configure and
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
with success
the problem was on that very last step

		Actually, I just tried to run everything and noticed that I got the following message when running bazel build with --verbose_failures:
edersantana@miner:~/python/tensorflow$ bazel build --verbose_failures -c opt --config=cuda

...

ERROR: /home/edersantana/python/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:281:1: undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '//tensorflow/core/kernels:split_lib_gpu':
this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'tensorflow/core/kernels/split_lib_gpu.cu.cc':
...
so the problem might be something else, but I still can't figure. I'll give it a try on other versions and see what happens.

 Your problem looks very similar to another issue, you probably can try the workaround there: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1157#issuecomment-192552759&gt;#1157 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I have reproduced the problem in my Ubuntu 14.04 desktop and fixed it with this workaround. So I am closing this issue.

		You mean this, right:

Adding
cxx_builtin_include_directory: "/usr/local/cuda/targets/x86_64-linux/include"
to file tensorflow/third_party/gpus/crosstool/CROSSTOOL
seem to be a workaround.

		Hi,
if someone can help me. I have a similar problem on Windows 10 (a friend has the same issue for Windows aswell) with tensorflow 0.12.0-rc0:
ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow.models'.
And the file gen_word2vec.py doesn't exist in tensorflow/models/embedding so I cannot even import it manually (from cloned GitHub).
I did the installation via pip for CPU, but even the folder /tensorflow/models is missing in that case.

		We are moving model/ out of this repo altogether and moving it to github.com/tensorflow/models. This is probably accidental, but it's a sign of the things to come.
