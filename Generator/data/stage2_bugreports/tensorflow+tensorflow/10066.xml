&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running the cifar 10 CNN example code (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10/&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), I get very different performance on several OS while having same installations of CUDA, CuDNN &amp; TF, and the same code of course.
With  (described above): running at ~2600 images/sec, Python CPU usage at ~50%
With  (described above): running at ~600 images/sec, Python CPU usage at  (!)
With  (described above): running at ~2600 images/sec, Python CPU usage at ~50%
I'm experiencing the same problems with TF r1.0.1.
Seems like something in this code (pherhaps the queue threading?) doesn't go well with win10? CPU usage reaches 100% with win10, and significantly slower, that's very weird.
Thanks.

		Why don't you use the latest TF version? Maybe it's fixed there.

		Tried with the latest release now as well. Same issue still exists.

, any ideas. Could you take a look?

		What are the CPUs and memory you are using on these machines, are they all the same?

		intel i7-7700
CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4
It's all the same hardware for all OS - it's a dual boot machine with windows 10 and ubuntu 16.04

 Any ideas why this may be happening?

		I'm not sure, sorry. I don't have a Windows machine to reproduce this on. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/oranshayer&gt;@oranshayer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you try again on Tensorflow 1.4?
/CC &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry&gt;@mrry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 again, any ideas why TensorFlow on windows could be slower than on Ubuntu?

		No idea, but the two variables seem to be that the configuration (Windows 10 Pro, GTX 1080 8gb) is slower than (Windows 7 Pro, Titan X maxwell 12gb), and the latter version is as fast as Ubuntu.
This makes me suspect that something in the configuration of your Windows 10 system is causing the problem, rather than TensorFlow. Driver version perhaps?

		I'm closing this due to lack of recent activity. Since TensorFlow 1.5.0rc0 with CUDA 9 support is now available, I expect much has changed since TensorFlow 0.12.1, which is over a year old now. If the problem reproduces with the latest version of TensorFlow, please feel free to reopen the issue.
