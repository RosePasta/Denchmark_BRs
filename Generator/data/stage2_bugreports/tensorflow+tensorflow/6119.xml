	<summary>Different prediction result for tf.learn QuickStart?</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
Today I upgrade tensorflow package and read the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/tflearn/index.md&gt;tutorials from the beginning&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.And find the result of classifier prediction is different, it is . I remember that the old version tf run out . So what's the problem?
The OS is OSX EI Capitan, and tensoflow is 0.12.0-rc0
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ `python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)"`
-bash: 0.12.0-rc0: command not found
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I turn on the INFO log level, the log lists below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python iris_classifier.py

		same issue with Linux server ( CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core) )
tensorflow version 0.12.0
I got the correct predictions [1,2] of my first run, but my following runs were all [1,1]...

		same problem .. still no solution ?

		Make sure you delete any pre-existing models. Assuming this is the iris tutorial take a look at
classifier = tf.contrib.learn.DNNClassifier(feature_columns=feature_columns, hidden_units=[10, 20, 10], n_classes=3, model_dir="/tmp/iris_model") 
If you don't delete the files in model_dir="/tmp/iris_model" you will be modifying the old model rather than creating a new one.

		Update to tensorflow 0.12.1. It seems fixed.

		Also, does anyone have a way to get rid of the error messages? The API is deprecated and tf.contrib.learn keeps changing so it's a bit hard to keep track of API updates.

		I made a fix version of this here. Using the custom pipe lines.

		Looks like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jacktang&gt;@jacktang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said this was fixed in 0.12.1, and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/XRayCheng&gt;@XRayCheng&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has a fix.
I'm closing this out.  Feel free to file issues for new problems you may run in to!

		With v1.1.0, this issue still occurs. The first output is [1,2] and all subsequent runs are [1,1] until I destroy the tmp model.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/XRayCheng&gt;@XRayCheng&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's "fix" is not actually a fix -- README still forewarns that all non-fresh runs will produce .
Some kind of clarification would be nice. ðŸ˜ž Picking up TF for the first time, and it's pretty rough when the main documentation examples aren't replicated locally.

 You've already found the solution. After you run the model once, it will be trained and stored in the tmp folder. If you do not delete the tmp folder you are retraining an existing model rather than doing one from scratch. It makes sense that it would have different results

		@agriasgg Thanks! But if that's truly the case, then that should be included as a note, imo. I was under the assumption that the model was only looking at the same CSV data every time, which means it should have arrived to [1,2] every time.
Nowhere in the example documentation did it say that every run was going to affect the subsequent outputs.
