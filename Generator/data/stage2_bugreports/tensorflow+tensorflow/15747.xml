	<summary>An easy problem about tensorflow GPU unilization</summary>
	<description>
Today , I run an easy RNN model to deal with a  NLP task, which the traindata is just about 4000 short sentences and the iteration is 30. However, the time cost about 1 hour to finish the procedure. my computer GPU is nvidia 1080Ti and CPU is i7 8700K.
In the console, the information is:
Total memory: 10.91GiB
Free memory: 10.30GiB
but in the terminal, i use the command： nvidia-smi -l
it return another information:
10713MiB / 11171MiB
my question are : 1. Does the GPU really work ???
2. if work, why the time cost still large???
Thx！

		Perhaps you can try profiling your code while you wait for a tensorflower. Here is an issue that might help: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1824&gt;#1824&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		A member of the TensorFlow organization has replied after the stat:awaiting tensorflower label was applied.

		Can you clarify what you mean by "In the console, the information is:"? What is the console, and how is it different from the terminal?
Also can you provide an example? We cannot debug or reproduce this without an self-contained code sample.
