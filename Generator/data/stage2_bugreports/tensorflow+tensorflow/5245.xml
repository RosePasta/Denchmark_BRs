	<summary>mean_squared_error gives warning about sum_of_squared_error</summary>
	<description>
I used tf.contrib.losses.mean_squared_error, but during training stage, tensorflow give me warning WARNING:tensorflow:sum_of_squares (from tensorflow.contrib.losses.python.losses.loss_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-10-01.
But I already used mean_squared_error, so this warning should not show.
Also the mean_squared_error &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/contrib.losses.html#mean_squared_error&gt;definition link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has the same warning, which I guess should not be there?

		What version are you using? In the current version it's been removed (as threatened).

		tf.__version__ gives me '0.10.0'. Yeah, I guess that's the reason. I may need update my TF version. (would be good to see the document update, though)

		I don't know that we cherry-pick for errors in documentation, but if so, you're welcome to submit a PR.

		We probably wont update 0.10 docs, as we are working on finalizing 0.11 now.

		Wait...when I upgrade TF to 0.11.0rc1, I still get the same warning when using mean_squared_error. Also, more surprisingly, sum_of_squares and mean_squared_error gives me same results, and it looks the result is the mean squared error.
I hope it's a small issue, because sum_of_squares is deprecated anyway.

		If we have a doc update for 0.11, we are accepting them until EOD today.

		It's been removed at HEAD, so I think it's OK. It's not easy to fix the docs so I think it's fine to have that little quirk.
FTR, we had
@deprecated("2016-10-01", "Use mean_squared_error.")
def sum_of_squares(predictions, targets, weight=1.0, scope=None):
 ...

mean_squared_error = sum_of_squares
