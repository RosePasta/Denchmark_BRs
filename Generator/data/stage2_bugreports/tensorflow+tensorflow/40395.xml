Hello,
I am having a lot of difficulties saving a subclassed model and reloading it. I have uploaded the current files I'm working on (specifically, policy.py) to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ryanmaxwell96/trpo_fractal5NN&gt;https://github.com/ryanmaxwell96/trpo_fractal5NN&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Now, I know you are supposed to be able to save things under the SavedModel format so that is what I've been trying to follow. But I'm still getting the error seen here:
'''
Traceback (most recent call last):

return (name.replace(_ESCAPE_CHAR, _ESCAPE_CHAR + _ESCAPE_CHAR)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'replace'
'''
In line 90 of the policy.py file is where I'm trying to save the subclassed model "self.trpo" after having called train_on_batch and predict_on_batch. I have absolutely no idea what the error is telling me.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Ryan

Request you to fill &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Also, let us know Tensorflow version you are using.
Request you to share colab link or simple standalone code to reproduce the issue in our environment.It helps us in localizing the issue faster.Thanks!

		Here is the colab file with the issue I was referring to. &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dD9QKj9-NzdCECBWKkkihS18Iqmlf5-o?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dD9QKj9-NzdCECBWKkkihS18Iqmlf5-o?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For the prompts it asks for, input the following in this order:
CartPoleBulletEnv-v1
n
1.0

		Ahh bummer. It gave me the error the first time through, but now is giving me another error I haven't seen before.

		Ok so I think I may see a problem. I used the model.summary() command to get:
trpo summary
Model: "trpo"
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

policy_nn (PolicyNN)         multiple                  4393
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

log_prob (LogProb)           multiple                  0
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

kl_entropy (KLEntropy)       multiple                  0
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Total params: 4,394
Trainable params: 4,393
Non-trainable params: 1
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

None
I have no idea why it says None at the end, but I'm guessing this is the problem. Any way to remove it?

		Sorry for the round-about way of doing this, as I don't really know how to use colab very well. But you need to upload these (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ryanmaxwell96/trpo_w_subclassing/upload&gt;https://github.com/ryanmaxwell96/trpo_w_subclassing/upload&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) files to the colab as well as use !pip install pybullet to get the errors that I've been talking about.

		If you follow the steps that I listed: upload these (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ryanmaxwell96/trpo_w_subclassing/upload&gt;https://github.com/ryanmaxwell96/trpo_w_subclassing/upload&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) files to the colab, use !pip install pybullet, and then type these (CartPoleBulletEnv-v1, n, 1.0) in when prompted, you should get the errors I was referring to.
I have shared the train colab file with you that should show the errors.
