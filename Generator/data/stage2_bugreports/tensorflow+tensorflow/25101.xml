The link to the TF-GAN tutorial is in tensorflow/contrib/gan/README.md L:59
points to &lt;denchmark-link:http://https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/gan/tutorial.ipynb&gt;http://https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/gan/tutorial.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but it should point to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/gan/tutorial.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/gan/tutorial.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The wrong link takes one to some sales page.
