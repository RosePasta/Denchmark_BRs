		Since TF 1.14 prebuilt binaries support cuda 10.0, can you try by switching to cuda 10.0  instead. Thanks!

		I see.  Using the nvcr container with TF 1.14 .  Which has Cuda 10.1.

		That is an easy ask, but very hard to do. I do not think that is the right way to handle large software.  My recommendation is to build in more detailed logs and metrics so as not to have to rely on largess of random developers.

		Is this still an issue after switching to cuda 10.0?
