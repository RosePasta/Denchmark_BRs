	<summary>KeyError in tf.contrib.graph_editor.graph_replace</summary>
	<description>
When applying graph_replace to graphs containing ops with the _original_op attribute, it can fail with a KeyError. The error occurs in Transformer._copy_ops when trying to copy an op whose _original_op has not yet been copied. The ordering of ops that are copied is not deterministic so this error pops up somewhat randomly.
The _original_op attributes appear to be created by tf.gradients to point back to the op from the forward pass.
Example code snippet (note: you may need to run this multiple times to get a failure):
import tensorflow as tf
graph_replace = tf.contrib.graph_editor.graph_replace
w = tf.Variable(0.0, name="w")
y = tf.multiply(tf.multiply(w, w, name="mul1"), w, name="mul2")
g = tf.gradients(y, w)[0]
g_new = graph_replace(g, {w.value(): g})
Error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/contrib/graph_editor/transform.py in transform_op_if_inside_handler(info, op, keep_if_possible)
    122   """
    123   if op in info.sgv.ops:
--&gt; 124     return info.transformed_ops[op]
    125   else:
    126     if keep_if_possible and info.graph is info.graph_:

KeyError: &lt;tf.Operation 'mul1' type=Mul&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I see three possible fixes:

Remove _original_op attributes in the copied graph (I don't see anywhere in the TF codebase where it is used)
Move the creation of the _original_op attribute from the copy_op_handler function to the end of Transformer._copy_ops after all ops have been copied.
Topologically sort the ops being copied so that ops that are _original_op attributes are created before their children.

My &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/poolio/tensorflow/pull/1/files&gt;implementation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of option 2 seems to fix this problem, but I might be missing something about the usage of .

 Here's an interesting graph editor issue for you. If you need toposort I wrote a Tarjan implementation in Python I can give you. Also get_walks_intersection_ops looks quadratic.

		The similar issue still persist when variable is matix:-
import tensorflow as tf
graph_replace = tf.contrib.graph_editor.graph_replace
w = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 784]),name="w")
y = tf. matmul(tf.matmul(w, w, name="mul1"), w, name="mul2")
g = tf.gradients(y, w)[0]
g_new = graph_replace(g, {w.value(): g})

		I'm happy to submit a PR using my &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/poolio/tensorflow/pull/1/files&gt;implementation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of the proposed second option. Please let me know whether that would be helpful as  was the only way of copying and replacing subgraphs. It would be great to have this working again, especially given that other PRs for similar features have been rejected (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5802&gt;#5802&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		Hi,
What's the current status of this bug as of r1.4?
Thanks!

 it still exists. This is the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/9978&gt;#9978&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Current work-around is to modify graph_editor source locally although PR would be welcome

		Closing out this issue, as tf.contrib is no longer supported in TensorFlow 2.x.
