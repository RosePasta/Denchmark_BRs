	<summary>TFLite cross-compiling arm64 build error?</summary>
	<description>
As I am currently trying to Tensorflow lite for ARM64 architecture, I just try to follow the instructions from below: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_arm64#cross-compile_for_arm64&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_arm64#cross-compile_for_arm64&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I simply get a compilation error: tensorflow/lite/tools/make/downloads/ruy/ruy/cpuinfo.cc:9:21: fatal error: cpuinfo.h: No such file or directory
I am surprised this starting build not working out of the box.
Btw, I am trying to do the above in Ubuntu 16.04 VM.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script
provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue
happens on a mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):From Git clone
TensorFlow version (use command below):latest
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with:
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

		Solved now. You need to explicity install Bazel for this. The tensorflow-lite dependencies script does not do this. Not sure why, should have been part of this.
