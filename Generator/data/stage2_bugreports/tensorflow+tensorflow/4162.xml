	<summary>contrib.layers: TypeError: optimize_loss() got an unexpected keyword argument 'summaries'</summary>
	<description>
Trying to provide a custom list of summaries to tf.contrib.layers.optimize_loss fails
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import tensorflow as tf
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.contrib.layers.optimize_loss(tf.constant(1), tf.constant(1), 0.01, tf.train.AdamOptimizer, summaries=['loss', 'gradients'])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: optimize_loss() got an unexpected keyword argument 'summaries'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Tested on a fresh 0.10.0rc0 install, as well as in the tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly docker image.
Little mystified by how this is occuring since the it's correct in source. I suspect it has something to do with everything being brought into the layers namespace.

		Just checked with current version (0.11rc1) - doesn't seem to have this issue. Please re-open if it still persists on your side.
