	<description>
There is no information about which cuda version required for pip packages
i think must be document as an table for old relases and
for recent release mustbe selection gui something like pytorch

		hard to find  link  of build configurations
and package dont check cuda version
so it causes a problem
and  some times both 1.x and 2.x version required
latest 1.x version 1.15.4 relased at Sep 2020 but still used Cuda 10
Ä° think clear explantion / documentation is required

		I understand your confusion however its important to note that dependencies such as cuda are updated very quickly and it is a challenge to keep various TF versions compatible with different cuda versions.
Hence we provide newest TF prebuilt binaries for latest/most recent cuda version and we do not backport new cuda versions to older TF versions due to limited resources unfortunately.
Also now that we are in TF 2.X new cuda versions will be made available for later TF 2.X versions.
