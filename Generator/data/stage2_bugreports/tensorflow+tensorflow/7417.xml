	<summary>Crashes in tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Possibly related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4282&gt;#4282&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
Also, &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29401116/abort-trap-6-in-c-program&gt;SO seems to suggest&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that "abort trap 6" is related to accessing memory that TF doesn't own.
Both problems boil down to bounds errors crashing the Python session instead of throwing an error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System: macOS Sierra 10.12.3
TF version 0.12.1. Pretty sure I'm using a CPU-only build, and my graphics card is not CUDA-compatible.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've managed to crash Python with sparse_tensor_dense_matmul in two different ways.  I've included a reproducible example for each.  Let me know if you'd prefer them split into two separate issues.
Crash 1
An off-by-one error crashes my Python session.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

nrow = 3
ncol = 10

X = tf.sparse_placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, ncol])
W = tf.ones([ncol,1])

# Note: largest allowable column index is ncol-1 because of zero-indexing
col_indices = [1, 2, ncol] 
indices = np.transpose(np.array([range(nrow),col_indices]))

sess.run(tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul(X,W), feed_dict={X:(indices, [1] * nrow, [nrow, ncol])})
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This kills my Python session, and I get the following at my bash prompt:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;F tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensor_dense_matmul_op.cc:242] Check failed: k &lt; lhs_right (10 vs. 10)
Abort trap: 6
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Crash 2
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

n = 3
m = 3324
p = 49

a_sparse = tf.sparse_placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, m])
b = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([m, p]))


indices = [[0,0],[1, 2]]
values = [1, 1]
shape = [n,m]

feed={a_sparse:(np.array([[3828,  135],
        [ 320,   11]]), [1, 1], [2, 3324])}


init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess.run(init)
sess.run(tf.sparse_tensor_dense_matmul(a_sparse, b), feed_dict=feed)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;F tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensor_dense_matmul_op.cc:273] Check failed: m &lt; out.dimension(0) (3828 vs. 2)
Abort trap: 6
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It looks like I'm exceeding the number of rows this time, and getting a crash instead of an error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What other attempted solutions have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

N/A

		Yep, this is a bug.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ebrevdo&gt;@ebrevdo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: Can you take a look?  Pure Python shouldn't be able to get a CHECK crash like this.

		Thanks for reporting this. I'll take a look likely after end of next week

 Which week were you referring to?

		<comment id='5' author='davharris' date='2017-06-16T20:14:10Z'>
		Indeed.  This op has been rewritten since the original report. Let's close
it and op can reopen if it still happens.
