	<summary>`tf.Summary` comparison operator overloading?</summary>
	<description>
So I was trying to use a comparison operation () with a  object. It does not throw an error, but the results are incorrect. I couldn't find any help for this on the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Summary/Value&gt;official documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Here are my logs --&gt;
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(Pdb) type(losses[0])
&lt;class 'tensorflow.core.framework.summary_pb2.Summary'&gt;
(Pdb) type(losses[1])
&lt;class 'tensorflow.core.framework.summary_pb2.Summary'&gt;
(Pdb) losses
[value {
  tag: "CTC Loss"
  simple_value: 40.2547607422
}
, value {
  tag: "CTC Loss"
  simple_value: 42.1486358643
}
]
(Pdb) losses[0] &gt; losses[1]
True
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The objects were created using . What do you think? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dandelionmane&gt;@dandelionmane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?

		These are protocol buffer objects. I have no expectation that the Python protocol buffer implementation will have a &gt; operator defined in a way that is aware of the semantic meaning of summary values. It might be doing a byte string comparison or something else.
It may be that you can find some documentation on the protobuf site that explains how this operator works, if you're really curious. &lt;denchmark-link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python-generated&gt;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python-generated&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
