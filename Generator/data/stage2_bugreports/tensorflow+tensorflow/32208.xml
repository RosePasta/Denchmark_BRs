While trying to run the code given on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/neural_structured_learning/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/neural_structured_learning/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I ran into the following error:
AttributeError: module 'neural_structured_learning.lib' has no attribute 'make_adv_reg_config'
I have already installed neural_structured_learning using !pip install neural_structured_learning and I am working on TF 2.0.0-rc0 on Colab (also tried it on 1.14)
I have also check the code on github and couldn't find make_adv_reg_config in neural_structured_learning/lib/*

		Seems like the method make_adv_reg_config() was moved to the configs module. The below code works:
adv_config = nsl.configs.make_adv_reg_config(multiplier=0.2, adv_step_size=0.05)

		Thank you for your response.
It's working now
