		2.6.32 is a very old kernel... I don't think it supports , which as far as I can tell was &lt;denchmark-link:https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/&gt;merged in 2013&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (to Linux 3.9).
As far as I remember, we don't actually use this feature but gRPC enables it by default on some sockets. We actually try to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc/grpc_server_lib.cc#L58&gt;disable it on server sockets&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, because it wreaks havoc with our unit tests.

 I am closing since this is not a supported platform. Your options, at this juncture, are to either disable that feature in your private copy of tensorflow and rebuild, or upgrade your kernel. The comment on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3261965/so-reuseport-on-linux&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 indicates that there was a backport for , so this might be the most viable option.

		I will try to update my kernel, thanks for your reply.
