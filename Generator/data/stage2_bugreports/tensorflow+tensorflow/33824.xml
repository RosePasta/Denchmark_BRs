	<summary>code and tutorial description mismatch on CNN</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Two mismatchs between output shape on model summary and tutorial:
1"To complete our model, you will feed the last output tensor from the convolutional base (of shape (3, 3, 64))"
should be changed to
To complete our model, you will feed the last output tensor from the convolutional base (of shape (4, 4, 64))
2."As you can see, our (3, 3, 64) outputs were flattened into vectors of shape (576) before going through two Dense layers."
This should be changed to
"As you can see, our (4, 4, 64) outputs were flattened into vectors of shape (1024) before going through two Dense layers.

		Thanks for the report, can you please send a pull request?
That file is here in the tensorflow/docs repo: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/images/cnn.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/images/cnn.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I am working on it right now. I have created a related issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34639&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Also relevant may be my observation &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/pull/1238&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Let me know if I am missing something. If not, I'm working on both issues right now.
