		Everything that doesn't have a full tutorial associated with it should go
into the zoo (which we will announce shortly). If you want to write a
tutorial we'd be happy to merge it into core.

 We're looking to open source in Q2. I was actually going to ask you (or someone else who works on Estimators) to look at the API soon.

		Automatically closing due to lack of recent activity. Please update the issue when new information becomes available, and we will reopen the issue. Thanks!

		New information: probably going to be the (very) beginning of Q3 rather than the end of Q2. Definitely in contrib for 1.3.
Re-opening because this is still relevant.

		We have some &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/timeseries&gt;time series Estimators in contrib&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Feel free to take a look and open specific bugs/feature requests.
