System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): effectively tf-nightly 20200710
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):

Describe the current behavior
When I call tf.keras.Model.fit() with a distributed dataset, one obtained from
strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(), in conjunction with class_weight,
I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    dataset = dataset.map(_make_class_weight_map_fn(class_weight))
AttributeError: 'DistributedDataset' object has no attribute 'map'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The model fit code looks like:
    model.fit(
      train_ds,
      epochs=FLAGS.epochs,
      steps_per_epoch=train_steps_per_epoch,
      validation_data=val_ds,
      validation_steps=val_steps_per_epoch,
      class_weight={
          0: 1.0,
          1: 5.0,
      },
      callbacks=[
          tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(FLAGS.logdir, profile_batch=50)
      ])
However, if I don't call strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset() on train_ds
and val_ds, the fit() works correctly.
The strategy here is simpley a OneDeviceStrategy with my GPU.
Describe the expected behavior
The expected behavior is that class_weight should work regardless of
whether the Dataset is distributed or not.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/caisq&gt;@caisq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, looking &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/Strategy#experimental_distribute_dataset&gt;at the docs for&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  you'll see it says "NOTE: Currently, the user cannot add any more transformations to a distributed dataset." I suspect this is what is causing the problem given the error message that there's  for a . Happy to help debug further if you can provide minimal reproducible code.
