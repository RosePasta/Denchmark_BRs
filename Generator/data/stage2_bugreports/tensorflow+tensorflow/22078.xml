	<summary>Tensorflow runtime error (misaligned data) with ARM 32bit NEON.</summary>
	<description>
With a c++ application using tensorflow in armv7 (32bit arm) + NEON, we had been experiencing the following errors in run-time:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[ 7128.415134] Alignment trap: not handling instruction f9048a1f at [&lt;b28ca130&gt;]
[ 7128.420838] Unhandled fault: alignment exception (0x801) at 0xbef9d1d4

Bus error (core dumped)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We are experiencing it even though we are using tensorflow 1.9.0, which has &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/88103d000add4ea7f8d1a34ee3c898fc79d9e3c7&gt;88103d0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 included mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/19158&gt;#19158&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
However, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/again4you&gt;@again4you&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has successfully fixed the issue with a few compiler options mandated although the current fix is created quick and dirty.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/again4you&gt;@again4you&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 : Please send a PR when you embed the compiler options (for arm32) after rewriting the fix so that the compiler options are added in CMake script (and Bazel as well if it seems not too difficult) for ARM32.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Happens both with and without custom codes.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04 and Tizen
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: No. But same architecture with such devices (armv7)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): github.com source, built with cmake.
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.9.0
Python version: 2.7.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A (used cmake)
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 6.2.1
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: ARM Mali. (not used)
Exact command to reproduce: Execute the C++ executable on a shell. (e.g., $ ./app 

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Memory misalignment error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[ 7128.415134] Alignment trap: not handling instruction f9048a1f at [&lt;b28ca130&gt;]
[ 7128.420838] Unhandled fault: alignment exception (0x801) at 0xbef9d1d4
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, we have a fix, which is going to be cleaned up to be sent as a PR.

		There were a couple of fixes to alignment (e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/88df5eaaa7313e1c714fc3e9413759faf043ff47#diff-b29424066d004b4c5bc4b563ba913954&gt;this one&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) besides the original fix.

 : Sorry for the trouble but can you test this on master as well.

		Ok, we will try to cherry-pick fixes and remove workarounds and test. However, please wait for a while, I don't think we will get the confirm from our users soon (like within a few days) enough.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/again4you&gt;@again4you&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 : please cherry-pick alignment fixes and remove the fixes already causing problems in debian/ubuntu distros and release it both for Tizen &amp; Ubuntu. (start the build &amp; release process today and let's check the effects next week)

 will provide .deb packages for arm-ubuntu.

 Any updates on the fix ? I am experiencing a similar issue with tensorflow 1.12 on armv7 when starting a Session.
