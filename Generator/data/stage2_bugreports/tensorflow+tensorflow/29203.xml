	<summary>how to use interactive_graphviz for xla?</summary>
	<description>
in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/jit#tutorial&gt;xla doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it suggest that

/tmp/foo will contain the HLO before and after optimizations for each HLO module that's run. You can read this as-is, or you can visualize it using tensorflow/compiler/xla/tools:interactive_graphviz.

but I cannot locate this binary.

 in the TensorFlow 1.14 release note, it mentioned that:

XLA
XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.

but I couldn't find how to use it.
