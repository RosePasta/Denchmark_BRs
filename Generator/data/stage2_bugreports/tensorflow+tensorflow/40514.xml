	<summary>TFBertForSequenceClassification: Non-deterministic when training on GPU, even with seeds fixed and TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS="1"</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: -
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): used on Google Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: Tesla K80

) with keras/tf2.2.0 on the GPU is non-deterministic, even when setting all relevant random seeds and following the best practice guide in &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9911-determinism-in-deep-learning.pdf&gt;these gputechconf slides&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

As clearly documented in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorflow-determinism#confirmed-current-gpu-specific-sources-of-non-determinism-with-solutions&gt;this table&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, training on the GPU can be expected to be deterministic for TF 2.2.0 when setting environment variable  to .
In spite of me setting this variable in my code (prior to importing tensorflow), this is not the case in my example.
Having seen previous issues (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/38185&gt;#38185&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) documented for , I also used the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/38185#issuecomment-643014439&gt;suggested workaround for those&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Nonetheless, my code remains non-deterministic on the GPU.

Describe the expected behavior
For TF 2.2.0, training on the GPU is expected to be deterministic when fixing random seeds and using:
os.environ["TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS"] = "1"
Thus, my expectation is that the example code provided in my colab notebook should be deterministic on the colab GPU runtime as well.

Colab Link, reproducible on CPU runtime, non-deterministic on GPU runtime: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VSU8lYFD0E1HKZrIL1MvyIRwAktlSF_t#scrollTo=9NM47IRsy_v4&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VSU8lYFD0E1HKZrIL1MvyIRwAktlSF_t#scrollTo=9NM47IRsy_v4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

.Is this the expected behavior?.Thanks!
