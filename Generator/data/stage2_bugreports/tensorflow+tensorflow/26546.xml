	<summary>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.compat.v2'</summary>
	<description>
Was going through the Jupyter notebook on TFP that was associated with the TF Dev Summit:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/jupyter_notebooks/Probabilistic_Layers_Regression.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/jupyter_notebooks/Probabilistic_Layers_Regression.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Run
Running the line
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
Returns the error:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.compat.v2'

Running tf.VERSION shows it's 1.13.
I'm assuming this is related to not having TF 2.0 installed, and only having T 1.13 installed.
Is a separate, 2nd installation of TF (2.0) needed to import tensorflow.compat.v2 or can both be installed into the same virtual environment?
Just want to make sure installing both alongside each other won't break either or both.
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"

b'unknown' 1.13.1

 Could you try changing "v2" to "v1". Like
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
It worked for me. Please let us know how it progresses. We will correct the typo. Thanks!

		Yes that works, but the issue is with the tensorflow_probability
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tf.enable_v2_behavior()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Yes I ran   pip install tensorflow and pip install tensorflow-probability

So I'm double sure they are both installed

		Had the same issue, if you cloned the github repo, make sure to checkout the v0.6.0-rc1 tag to run the examples with the 0.6.0 version from pip. I guess the examples in master is made to work with tf2.
Works for me at least..

		i have installed tensorflow==1.8.0, i have to run a file in order to star my training. but I am getting this error.

then i wrote this command "pip install tensorflow.compat" i got following error

		Hi Everyone,
When this was published, it required tf-nightly or any of preview releases of tensorflow
-2.0. That was the original source of confusion.
The tf.compat.v2 module was added in 1.14. Upgrade to 1.14 , 1.15, or 2.0  and this will work fine.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install -U "tensorflow==1.15" 
pip install -U "tensorflow==2.0" 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

There is absolutely no way to run it with 1.13, or 1.8, sorry!

I am getting the same error when importing tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf. Any further suggestions as I would like to use tensorflow==1.8.0?

		I have tensorflow 1.4.0 with Cuda 8 and cudnn 7. And I get the following error.
   import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow.compat'

 I looked the tensorflow_gpu version for CUDA 8 and CudNN 7 and it was 1.4.1. Now, I am getting a bunch of warnings and the script won't run.
Why should I upgrade 1.14?

		If your problem is with RASA CORE, in my case, I executed the following commands:
pip install -U tensorflow==1.15
pip install -U tensorflow==2.0
pip install -U gast==0.3.3
pip install -U tf-nightly-gpu
pip install -U tensorboard==1.15.0

		One common way to get stuck in a particular tensorflow version is to have an old version of python or pip.
If you try to install a specific version and it fails then check your python and pip versions.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install -U "tensorflow==1.15.*"
pip install -U "tensorflow==2.2.*"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

pip install tensorflow only gets you the latest version if those are up to date.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SharadSirsat&gt;@SharadSirsat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 did this work as a solution to  "tensorflow.compat.v1"  or are you saying that the problem exists even when you reinstalled TF?
