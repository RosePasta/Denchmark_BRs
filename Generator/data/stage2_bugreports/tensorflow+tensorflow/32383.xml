		I have the same problem when trying  a simple AutoGraph example form the 2.0 documentation.
I have tested in both python 3.7.2 and 3.5.6 both with tensorflow==2.0.0rc0.
A working colab example is found here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uDkPGwGd3l7Gv3-CCmELVsStlE4n-ndL&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uDkPGwGd3l7Gv3-CCmELVsStlE4n-ndL&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried to run the exact same python code locally, giving same issue with
"Cause: Bad argument number for Name: 3, expecting 4"
"OperatorNotAllowedInGraphError: iterating over tf.Tensor is not allowed: AutoGraph did not convert this function. Try decorating it directly with @tf.function."
See appended files for source code and full stdout + stderr.

		My problem looks like it is originating from tensorflow_core/python/autograph/pyct/templates.py in the following function
def _convert_to_ast(n):
  """Converts from a known data type to AST."""
  # Note: When generating AST nodes from strings/QNs in isolation, ctx is
  # unknown. ctx must be filled in according to the template being used.
  # See ReplaceTransformer.visit_Name.
  if isinstance(n, str):
    return gast.Name(id=n, ctx=None, annotation=None)
  if isinstance(n, qual_names.QN):
    return n.ast()
  if isinstance(n, list):
    return [_convert_to_ast(e) for e in n]
  if isinstance(n, tuple):
    return tuple(_convert_to_ast(e) for e in n)
  return n
Problematic line:
 return gast.Name(id=n, ctx=None, annotation=None)
The gast.Name() call (I have no prior experience with gast) seems to be complaining because it expects type_comment argument. It is checking for 4 arguments ('id', 'ctx', 'annotation', 'type_comment') but it is only getting three.
This is from my gast.py where it states which arguments gast.Name should recive
    'Name': (('id', 'ctx', 'annotation', 'type_comment'),

It happens to me when using this on Colab:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;%tensorflow_version 2.x
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It works when using:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!pip install -q tensorflow==2.0.0-rc0
!pip freeze

I was using gast 0.3.1 but switching to version 0.2.2 seems to have fixed this for me.
Could you tell me how to switch the version？

New update:
gast has been pinned to 0.2.2 for 1.15 and 2.0 and later releases as well as nightly.
TF 1.14 or earlier don't have gast pinned and won't get it as we are not doing more releases there (except for security vulnerabilities).
If you encounter this issue on 1.14 or earlier, please install gast==0.2.2 using pip before installing tensorflow.
