	<summary>word2vec tutorial plot labels are incorrect</summary>
	<description>
The plot produced by the word2vec tutorial looks like random words.
In tensorflow/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py line 223 (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py#L223&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py#L223&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), the code gets labels for the first 500 words/embeddings by extracting 500 keys from the word dictionary without respect to their indices, using:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;labels = list(dictionary.keys())[:plot_only]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Line 223 should probably be something like the following, since the each key's value is the word index:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;labels = list(sorted(dictionary, key=dictionary.get))[:plot_only]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Glad someone also saw this issue.
The words I got in the outputted t-SNE plot were mostly obscure, and weren't anything like the ones shown in the tutorial example plot image.
labels = [reverse_dictionary[i] for i in xrange(plot_only)]
also worked for me.
