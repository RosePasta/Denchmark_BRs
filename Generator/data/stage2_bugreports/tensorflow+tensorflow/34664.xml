	<summary>TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers fails to build</summary>
	<description>
Attempting to build the test arduino library using:
./tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/ci_build/test_arduino.sh
Throws a error about not being able to execute Arduino-cli.
I installed Arduino-cli through brew but still get the error.
System information

Mac OSX 10.15.1
TensorFlow version: Master
Python version: 2.7

If I had to guess the build script is pulling down the linux binary and failing to run it. But I have not verified this.

,
Is this still an issue? Could you please update TensorFlow to v2.3 and check if you are still facing the same error. Thanks!
