	<summary>TFLITE Flower Classification codelab not working on own model it's always crashed</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (Ubuntu 20.04 ):
Mobile device (OPPO A37fw)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (2.2.0):
Python version:3.7

Describe the current behavior
I changed the model.tflite and label.txt on my own model and labels but it's not working. Using the default tflite model and label.txt work though.
Describe the expected behavior
