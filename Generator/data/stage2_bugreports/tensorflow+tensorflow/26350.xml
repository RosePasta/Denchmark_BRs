	<summary>[TF 2.0] Checkpoint breaking change for RNN.</summary>
	<description>
Type of breakage: Breakage with changing code.
APIs that are affected:

tf.nn.dynamic_rnn
tf.nn.static_rnn
tf.nn.bidirectional_dynamic_rnn
tf.nn.static_bidirectional_rnn
All cells within the tf.nn.rnn_cell.* module.

Description of change: The current TensorFlow RNN code is going to be replaced by tf.keras RNNs in TensorFlow 2.0. User will need to update their code to use the new Keras API. The weights of the Keras RNN cell are different from the existing TensorFlow RNN cell.
Variable name change map: The RNN cell weights are in a different format between existing TensorFlow RNN cells and Keras cells. There is currently no direct mapping for that.
Target time window: Undecided since the update requires a non-trivial user side change.

		Unassigning myself, as this is more of an FYI than a solvable problem.

		AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.compat.v1' has no attribute 'contrib'
I am facing this error while using rnn model in my code. Although I used
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()
help me how can I solve it
