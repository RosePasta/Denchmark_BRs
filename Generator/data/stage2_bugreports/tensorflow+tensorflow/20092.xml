	<summary>Tensorflow Website XSRF Token missing or incorrect</summary>
	<description>
The error occurs when I click develop button in "www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variables" or in everywhere. My default lang is set to English(but it does not matter and has influence only on the bottom menu). But when I'm trying to change the language to Chinese I get the following error message:

XSRF Token missing or incorrect

		There are XSRF issues with switching languages if you are signed in with multiple accounts.  Is that the case here?

		Given there's been no followup in two weeks, I'm closing this.  We are aware of a bug with XSRF and multi-login, and I assume this is was what happened here.  The site eng team is working on it.
If it wasn't please reopen or refile.  Thanks!
