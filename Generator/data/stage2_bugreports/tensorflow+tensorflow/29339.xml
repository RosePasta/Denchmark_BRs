	<summary>[TF 2.0 API Docs] tf.data.Dataset.map() example has web render issues.</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;The map() method call for each of these classes has an example which is not being rendered properly.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is what is intended by the docstring
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;   # NOTE: The following examples use `{ ... }` to represent the
    # contents of a dataset.
    # Each element is a `tf.Tensor` object.
    a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
    # `map_func` takes a single argument of type `tf.Tensor` with the same
    # shape and dtype.
    result = a.map(lambda x: ...)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is what gets rendered to the web.  It looks like the back tick references have an issue.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# NOTE: The following examples use `{ ... }` to represent the
# contents of a dataset.
# Each element is a &lt;a href="../../tf/Tensor"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tf.Tensor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object.
a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
# `map_func` takes a single argument of type &lt;a href="../../tf/Tensor"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tf.Tensor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the same
# shape and dtype.
result = a.map(lambda x: ...)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No, the docstring looks correct.  I don't know how to fix the error.

		Why are there reference links inside the code after all? I'm confused.
You can't click them anyway, right?

		The code creates documentation via doc strings.

		I donâ€™t know if the code links work or not.  That is a good point.

		The issue also exists in r2.0 &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#for_example_5&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#for_example_5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Regarding the links in the code block, we auto-link backticked TF symbols, so it's probably written as `tf.Tensor`. We probably shouldn't expand links in code blocks, if we can detect that.

Could we check for "#" in the same line? In that way we could know that it is a code comment and thus, not link it.

		Yes, that would work.

		I would like to work on it if that is okay with you and if you could point me in the right direction as I don't know where this is done.

		Hey, you can definitely work on it. Thanks.
To start, changing the regular expression here (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/tools/tensorflow_docs/api_generator/parser.py#L118&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/tools/tensorflow_docs/api_generator/parser.py#L118&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) to not consider lines that start with '#' should solve it.
Good luck and let me know if you have any questions :)

		I have opened a PR. I believe that should do the work.
Thanks!

		I think this issue could be closed now as it is solved!
