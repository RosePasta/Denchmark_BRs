	<summary>Bug in tf.strings.split vs tf.compat.v1.string_split</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colab
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.6.9

Describe the current behavior
tf.strings.split doesn't work as expected when the seperator is multiple characters.
Describe the expected behavior
tf.strings.split().to_sparse() should have the exact same behavior as tf.compat.v1.string_split()
yet when multiple characters are provided, tf.strings.split doesn't work

import tensorflow as tf
sentence = tf.constant([['cat goes meow'], ['dog?goes!woof']])
print(sentence)
v2 = tf.strings.split(sentence,' !?').to_sparse()
print(v2)
v1 = tf.compat.v1.string_split(tf.reshape(sentence, [-1]), ' !?')
print(v1)

 Since TF 2.0+, the behavior of  has been adjusted to match the behavior of python's native split, i.e.,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'cat goes meow'.split(' !?')
['cat goes meow']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'cat goes meow'.split(' ')
['cat', 'goes', 'meow']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For that the behavior of tf.strings.split is expected.

		I see how this complies with python's string split.
But on the other hand, I wish there's a clearer indication in the documentation to talk about this upgrade from v1.
And from the usability standpoint, the equivalent of splitting on multiple characters by v1.string_split would be harder for the v2 strings.split to accomplish. In the python equivalent, I would have to use re.split.
Is there any work to support this functionality?

		tf.text has a "regex_split" operation.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!pip install tensorflow-text
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_text as tf_text
tf_text.regex_split("dog?goes!woof", "[!?]")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
