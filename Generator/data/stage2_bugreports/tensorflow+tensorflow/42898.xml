Failure details
I have made an image classifier model to classifiy rock,paper,scissor images.But the problem is i was able to convert it to tflite model but the size of the model exceeds 200mb.I want to use it in android studio.When i add the model it give me error.How can i reduce the tflite model size while conversion.

		You could try post_training_quantiziation &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Also see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization/guide/quantization/post_training#quantizing_weights&gt;weight quantization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Setting  flag can help reduce the model weights. Thanks!
