	<summary>How to train Multibox object detector included in the TF Detect Android demo</summary>
	<description>
There is a way to train a custom model for the multibox object detector that is included in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/src/org/tensorflow/demo/DetectorActivity.java&gt;TF Detect Android demo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

 We're preparing a walk through for exactly this; should be out sometime in the not-too-distant future.

		Assigning to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andrewharp&gt;@andrewharp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 assuming he wants to add  to the commit message which adds that walkthrough.

 can you give us an update about the walk through? Thanks for your awesome work

 We're still moving around stuff internally; it's ending up being a bit tricky to open-source. In the meantime there is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/src/org/tensorflow/demo/TensorFlowYoloDetector.java&gt;TF YOLO detector&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which you should be able to find training walkthroughs for online.

		Is there a trained version available for the custom inceptionV2 used for the feature extraction in the multibox object detector ?
Thank you for your work on this demo

		hey Andrew, is this still forthcoming?

		<comment id='7' author='cyanoboy' date='2017-06-23T20:36:44Z'>
		This is still active. We're looking to get a model compatible with the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection&gt;TF Object Detection API&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 out in the next 2 or 3 weeks. That should provide a much easier path to retraining.

		Yup, this should be done soon, stay tuned!

		The default object detector in the Android Object Detection demo is now the 80-class &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/object_detection&gt;Object Detection API&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 SSD model thanks to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jch1&gt;@jch1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's commit, so retraining is now possible following the tutorials there.
The Yolo and original Multibox detectors remain available by modifying &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/src/org/tensorflow/demo/DetectorActivity.java#L89&gt;DetectorActivity.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (the person-detecting multibox model  would also need to be added to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/BUILD#L92&gt;external_assets&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if reverting).
