	<summary>TensorFlow Hub models crashing on TF Lite</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.6
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.10.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0
GPU model and memory: Nvidia GTX 1050Ti 4GB
Exact command to reproduce: Running TF Lite label_image example with a retrained TF Hub model

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

[Bug] I used TensorFlow image model retraining scripts to train a custom model using TensorFlow Hub feature extractors (MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2). When I try to run the retrained TensorFlow Hub image models in Tensorflow Lite, I get errors about dimension mismatches and allocations (see error below). I have successfully run retrained MobileNetV1 classifiers (that were not downloaded from TF Hub) using TensorFlow Lite without issue, so I am assuming that the problem stems from an issue with TF Lite/TOCO and TF Hub models.
I am running TF Lite 1.6 right now because the build process for 1.7 is broken (lite/kernels/internal/spectogram.cc depends on the FFT2D library which is built with the full TF Makefile/dependency download script but not in the TF Lite Makefile/dependency download script).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The error output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels/sub.cc:48 NumDimensions(input1) != NumDimensions(input2) (4 != 0)
FATAL: Failed to allocate tensors!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		It looks like you are subtracting a scalar. Scalars are currently not supported. You can try using a 1d vector. Do you have a small reproducible test case that you can provide so I can help you further?

		It has been 14 days with no activity and the awaiting response label was assigned. Is this still an issue?
