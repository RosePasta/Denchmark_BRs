	<summary>Keras model.predict on large datasets throws OOM</summary>
	<description>
I am using ImageDataGenerator and a Keras model (tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB5). While training I also use the ImageDataGenerator and everything works as expected. But if I use the predict function from the keras model on large data sets, it throws an OOM error, even if it worked in previous versions (e.g. 2.1).
The allocator also tries to allocate a weird shape, it seems like the GPU tries to allocate the memory for all the predictions in GPU memory and not into RAM. If I divide the data in chunks and process them in separate predict calls the error does not occur.
