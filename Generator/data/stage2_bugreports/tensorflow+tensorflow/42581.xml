	<summary>TensorScatterUpdate unsupported dtype complex64/128, tf2.3.0, GPU</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Arch Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary (pip)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.0
Python version: 3.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1/10.2
GPU model and memory: TITAN V, RTX2080TI

Describe the current behavior
The tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update function raises:
InvalidArgumentError: Unsupported dtype: complex64 [Op:TensorScatterUpdate]
InvalidArgumentError: Unsupported dtype: complex128 [Op:TensorScatterUpdate]
when running tf2.3.0 on GPU, in eager mode, and using dtypes complex64 and complex128.
You can reproduce this error by executing the following code on GPU with tf2.3.0:
import tensorflow as tf
var = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(10, dtype=tf.complex64))
up = tf.constant([1], dtype=tf.complex64) 
tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(var, [[0]], up)
Note that the code works as expected if we compile the call with tf.function, and it also works fine on CPU.
Describe the expected behavior
The tensor_scatter_nd_update in tf2.3 should work on GPU if the dtype is complex64 or complex128, as in tf2.2 and tf2.1.

I am able to replicate the issue on 2.3, please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/8f40760297dda1e9a10e76e53359b403/untitled384.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This code is working as expected on tf-nightly GPU, please refer to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/f40630d9d03c97966018d4c3fa680057/untitled384.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for the confirmation. Do you have an ETA for the next release based on this tf-nightly?

ETA depends on lot of factors. But the last release candidate is 2.3rc2. So I guess there will in 2.4 in near future.

		Thanks, anyway I would suggest to include a specific test for this function to avoid similar issues in future releases.
