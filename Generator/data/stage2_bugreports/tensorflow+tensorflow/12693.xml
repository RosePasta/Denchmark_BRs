&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 Pro 1703
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): install binary with GPU version by pip based on Python 3.5.2
TensorFlow version (use command below):('1.3.0')
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):none
CUDA/cuDNN version:cuda v8.0/cuDNN v6,0
GPU model and memory:GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to open TensorBoard after running mnist_with_summaries.py source code from the TensorBoard tutorials (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). However,
After I run tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist in cmd, it stuck and did not showing anything else.  I try to use tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist --debug and have the same result.

 any update? Did you figure out why the tensorboard stucks? I have the same problem. Windows 7, TF 1.3.
In my case, cmd does not shown the usual message to let me know that I see the result on Port XXXX but if I go to my localhost, I can see that the scalars are updating anyway.

Did you tried ctrl+c to interrupt the execution?
If the execution stop, it means it was running. So, if it was running, it should be displaying the results.
While running, open a tab in google chrome and type &lt;denchmark-link:http://admin-pc:6006/&gt;http://admin-pc:6006/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or localhost:6006.
If in scalars or graph are not displayed, maybe your graph or logdir is incorrect.
Also, try to update tensorflow or tensorboard. You never know when your antivirus or windows itself delete a small file.
I am not an expert but when I face problems with tensorflow, I just try all the possibilities.

 it is working now. I try to open by type &lt;denchmark-link:http://admin-pc:6006/&gt;http://admin-pc:6006/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but never try localhost:6006. I guess my cmd some how just not show result message. I could open it by localhost:6006 now.Thank you very much!

		From what I understand, TensorBoard isn't showing logs output, but if you go to the web address, it still shows the GUI.
We recently made some changes to the logging code, that has special cases for Windows.
Is there any chance you could try locally modifying this piece of code right here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/tensorboard/util.py#L282&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/tensorboard/util.py#L282&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where it says ? We might need to update this, or something related.

		We've now pushed the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/releases/tag/0.1.6&gt;0.1.6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 release to &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tensorflow-tensorboard/0.1.6&gt;PyPi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which should fix this issue. Please run:
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-tensorboard

		<comment id='7' author='DedongZhang' date='2019-09-25T13:55:33Z'>
		first pip uninstall tensorflow-tensorboard and then pip install tensorboard.
This will work
