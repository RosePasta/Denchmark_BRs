	<summary>There are no control inputs between 'Assign' and 'read' nodes</summary>
	<description>
I thought there should be some dependencies between 'Assign' and 'read' nodes, so that 'read' only executes after 'Assign' is done. But through the following toy example, this seems to be not the case:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
a = tf.get_variable('a', shape = (2,3))

print ('op_name', 'control_inputs', 'input_ops', 'output[0]_shape')
for op in tf.get_default_graph().get_operations():
  print (op.name, op.control_inputs, [inp.op.name for inp in op.inputs], op.outputs[0].shape)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;op_name control_inputs input_ops output[0]_shape
a/Initializer/random_uniform/shape [] [] (2,)
a/Initializer/random_uniform/min [] [] ()
a/Initializer/random_uniform/max [] [] ()
a/Initializer/random_uniform/RandomUniform [] ['a/Initializer/random_uniform/shape'] (2, 3)
a/Initializer/random_uniform/sub [] ['a/Initializer/random_uniform/max', 'a/Initializer/random_uniform/min'] ()
a/Initializer/random_uniform/mul [] ['a/Initializer/random_uniform/RandomUniform', 'a/Initializer/random_uniform/sub'] (2, 3)
a/Initializer/random_uniform [] ['a/Initializer/random_uniform/mul', 'a/Initializer/random_uniform/min'] (2, 3)
a [] [] (2, 3)
a/Assign [] ['a', 'a/Initializer/random_uniform'] (2, 3)
a/read [] ['a'] (2, 3)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So a/Assign and a/read nodes have no dependencies, and may execute in any order. Is there supposed to be any?

I have tried in colab with 2.2.0-rc3.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/7b3b2cec0583130542c0c2c82aea4be9/untitled827.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.I am not able to reproduce complete output to check the order.Thanks!

 Can you try it in TF-1.x, not TF-2?

		I have tried in colab with TF 1.15 and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/f84bf3655d794b765d84fb29c0ca08c4/untitled836.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		TF1 doesn't add any dependencies you didn't add yourself. It's up to you to decide what order you want stuff to run in.

 Can you clarify it a little more? When building a model, we usually don't specify the execution order of  and  since they are added by  internally, and  does not add control dependencies between them either. So how does  decide which one should execute first? Hope you can comment on that a little. Thanks.

		The default assign and the default read are unordered. If you want ordered
reads and writes you have to add them yourself with the control
dependencies you need.

 Thanks. But aren't they supposed to be ordered?  should be initialized by  before being . Right?

		No, not really. Control dependencies only apply to the scope of a single
session.run, and if all reads depended on the initialization you'd
reinitialize the variable on every call to session.run, not just the first
one, so you'd never be able to update any variable.
