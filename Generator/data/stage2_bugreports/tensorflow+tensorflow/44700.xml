GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): CentOS 8
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): r1.15
Python version: 3.6.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.26.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 4.8.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: Telsa V100

Describe the current behavior
In tf.segment_sum GPU version, there is no incremental check on segment_ids. I tried an unsorted segment_ids, and get a wrong result without any exception or warning.
Describe the expected behavior
If the segment_ids is required in an incremental sequence,  I think there should be an exception or warning in the implementation.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
  data = tf.constant([[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]], dtype=tf.float32)

  seg_ids = tf.constant([0,0,1,0], dtype=tf.int32)

  gpu_op = tf.segment_sum(data, seg_ids)
  #Got [[16. 20.]].
  #But an exception or warning is expected.

There is support for 2.x only, Can you please upgrade your tf version and let us know if you face any issues on 2.x
