	<summary>tf.metrics.MeanIoU throws dimensions mismatch error when used with SparseCategoricalCrossEntropy</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 20.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): TF.2.2.0
Python version: 3.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 2.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): gcc7
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.2
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Titan Xp (12GB)

Describe the current behavior
tf.metrics.meanIOU throws a dimensions mismatch error when using a model trained using SparseCategoricalCrossEntropy for a semantic segmentation problem.
My model outputs  dimensions = 224x224x2, y_true = 224x224x1 (class_indices).
A workaround was suggested at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32875#issuecomment-629360707&gt;#32875 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and worked for TF2.1, but fails with a dimensions mismatch error for TF2.2.
The suggested fix that doesn't work in TF.2.2:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
# fix for miou calculation when using sparse_categorical _cross_entropy 
    # https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32875

class UpdatedMeanIoU(tf.keras.metrics.MeanIoU):
    @tf.function
    def __call__(self, y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None):
        self.y_pred = tf.math.argmax(self.y_pred, axis=-1)
        return super().__call__(y_true, self.y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weight)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Here is the error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
    ValueError: Dimension 0 in both shapes must be equal, but are 1048576 and 2097152. Shapes are [1048576] and [2097152].
    	From merging shape 0 with other shapes. for '{{node confusion_matrix/stack_1}} = Pack[N=2, T=DT_INT64, axis=1](confusion_matrix/control_dependency_2, confusion_matrix/control_dependency_3)' with input shapes: [1048576], [2097152].
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Appreciate a fix.

		I also have this problem, this is my notebook:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15Sta5cKbQ8e4UC1Fh_D2yg9nYpmVzNIT#scrollTo=NkQtWL5PMj0l&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15Sta5cKbQ8e4UC1Fh_D2yg9nYpmVzNIT#scrollTo=NkQtWL5PMj0l&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can check it. There are some workarounds using inheritance of tf.keras.metrics.Metric but I think it's better that this bug is fixed.
