	<summary>auto-deeplab: nas_network runs into ValueError with personal data</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I've been trying to use auto deeplab on my own dataset. The only part I touched is the stem creation. Instead of feeding a image set of dimension [?, y, x, 3] I feed data of dimension [?, y, x, 13]. The first 10 features of the last dimension correspond to character embeddings, and the last 3 are unrelated floats in the [0, 1] range. There are no NANs in this dataset.
To do this, I replace the beginning of the _nas_net function in nas_network.py. I get an array with shape [?, y, x, 4] as input, the first feature is a char ID to be replaced by a 10 dimensional embedding, the 3 other features stay as they are. This leads to a [?, y, x, 13] tensor which is then used by the rest of the code.
As my input seems sensible enough, I believe this may be a bug with the implementation. Could someone investigate this further, please?
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Tried on both ubuntu 18.04 and windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.13.1
Python version: 3.7.3
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1/ 7.6
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080TI 11GB on ubuntu, CPU on windows

Describe the current behavior
program crashes with error pasted at the bottom of this issue
Describe the expected behavior
auto deeplab keeps going as expected

replace the content of /tensorflow/models/research/deeplab/core/nas_network.py by &lt;denchmark-link:https://pastebin.com/jFu8EUxT&gt;this code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and run nas_network.py directly. The only modification I brought to this file, besides the new  part at the bottom to run a simple fail case, can be found in the _nas_stem function.

Thanks for your reply, I just tried running my script directly from a clone of this repo and I can indeed see this error, even when moving the working directory to the right spot.
For now, the simplest way around this I can propose is to simply move the deeplab folder out of its parent folder. Fixed that error for me.

Even after following the same steps as per your instruction with reference to screenshot below, same issue is being faced.

		If you're calling it from a command line, try adding
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import sys
sys.path.append("")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

to nas_network.py, before the deeplab imports
