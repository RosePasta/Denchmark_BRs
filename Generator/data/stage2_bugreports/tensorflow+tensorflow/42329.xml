You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
tf.nest.assert_same_structure crashes (abort, systemerror) when some either check_types or expand_composites is 0d bool is violated.
Describe the expected behavior
Expect no crash
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
When check_types is boolean is violated
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.nest.assert_same_structure(nest1=np.zeros((1)), nest2=tf.ones((1,1,1)), check_types=tf.ones((2)))
When expand_composites is boolean is violated
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.nest.assert_same_structure(nest1=np.zeros((1)), nest2=tf.ones((1,1,1)), expand_composites=tf.ones((2)))
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Was able to reproduce the issue with TF v2.1, TF v2.3 and TF-nightly.
Session crashes on running the  line. Please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/7e2519ef8640e2d849516d0d363ae230/42329.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		The issue is more or less complicated and is related to pybind's handling of mismatched python type binding. A easy fix might be to enforce the type passed to pybind conforms to bool (for check_types and expand_composites). Created a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/42397&gt;#42397&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the fix.
