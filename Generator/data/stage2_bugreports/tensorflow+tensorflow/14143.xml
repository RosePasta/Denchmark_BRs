	<summary>Passing `clear_devices=True` to `SavedModelBuilder.add_meta_graph_and_variables()` loses function definitions</summary>
	<description>
The  inadvertently strips all function definitions from the  when . See this gist for a repro (thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eggie5&gt;@eggie5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for finding it!):

The bug appears to stem from export_meta_graph(), which builds a GraphDef by selective field copying when certain options (such as clear_devices=True) are passed. Passing clear_devices=False enables the code to succeed. However, it breaks compatibility between tf.data (and potentially other code) and SavedModel, so we should find a sustainable fix.

 Can you please take a look? Thanks!
