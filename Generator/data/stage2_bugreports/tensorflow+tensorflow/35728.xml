	<summary>Wrong Window Size while training the model</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l08c05_forecasting_with_machine_learning.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l08c05_forecasting_with_machine_learning.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Window size should be 30 instead of 20 in the description under "Forecasting With Machine Learning".
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29497701/72131252-b1905980-33a1-11ea-8cf5-11d089d5316e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As we can see under "Linear Model", window_size=30 while in description it is mentioned as model forecasts, given previous 20 steps.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Yes...

		This is already resolved. In the updated docs, the window size is mentioned correctly. Please check &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l08c05_forecasting_with_machine_learning.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

First, we will train a model to forecast the next step given the previous 30 steps, therefore, we need to create a dataset of 30-step windows for training.

I am closing this issue as this was already resolved. Thanks!
