	<summary>Autograph fails after restoring from the checkpoint</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below):

conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.0-alpha

Python version:
3.7.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
not relevent
GPU model and memory:
not relevent

Describe the current behavior
Running the following code for the first time show no warning. However, running it the second time results in this Warning message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;W0412 15:23:38.694277 140471310108480 tf_logging.py:161] Entity &lt;method-wrapper '__call__' of weakref object at 0x7fc1a2ba3908&gt; could not be transformed and will be staged without change. Error details can be found in the logs when running with the env variable AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY &gt;= 1. Please report this to the AutoGraph team. Cause: Object conversion is not yet supported. If you are trying to convert code that uses an existing object, try including the creation of that object in the conversion. For example, instead of converting the method of a class, try converting the entire class instead. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/autograph/README.md#using-the-functional-api for more information.W0412 15:23:38.697970 140471310108480 tf_logging.py:161] Entity &lt;method-wrapper '__call__' of weakref object at 0x7fc1a00bfb38&gt; could not be transformed and will be staged without change.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Autograph should works just find even after restoring from a checkpoint.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
import os
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'

network = models.Sequential([layers.Dense(1, activation='relu')])


@tf.function
def forward(batch):
    network(batch)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    ckpt = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=network)
    manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(ckpt, '/tmp/ckpttest', max_to_keep=10)
    if manager.latest_checkpoint:
        print(f'Resume training using {manager.latest_checkpoint}')
        ckpt.restore(manager.latest_checkpoint)

    batch = tf.zeros((1, 1), dtype=tf.float32)
    forward(batch)
    manager.save()
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		I could reproduce the issue with TF2.0.0-alpha0. Thanks!

		Thanks for reporting this bug! The error looks familiar, and might be fixed at head. I'll verify.

		Sorry for the delay. This is fixed in tf-nightly.
