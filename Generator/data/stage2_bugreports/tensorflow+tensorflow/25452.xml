	<summary>Memory detected less than real value</summary>
	<description>
I used tf-1.13-python. But when I ran 'tf.Session()', I found it had only 8.99GB free memory instead of 11GB, which was confirmed with 'nvidia-smi', task manager and GPU-Z.
CUDA:10.0
CUDNN:7.4.1
System:win 10

Note that the same problem occurred after I installed tensorflow 1.12 compiled by someone based on CUDA 10.0. So I think this problem may not only belongs to tf-1.13rc0, but many versions on Windows platforms. I guess perhaps Windows 10 (or more Windows versions, may be drivers) has some features to avoid that a graphics card uses too much GPU memory. As we know, there are often some programs occupying a small amount of memory, but as for me, other programs only consume almost 100MB while 2GB cannot be  thought available. So strange, right?
I am sorry for not providing details. You can get them below.

		This issue is discussed on the NVIDIA forum and seems to be a known issue with windows.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/996667/gtx-980ti-6gb-only-have-4-97gb-memory-available-with-win10-64/&gt;https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/996667/gtx-980ti-6gb-only-have-4-97gb-memory-available-with-win10-64/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Let me know if that does not explain the situation.
