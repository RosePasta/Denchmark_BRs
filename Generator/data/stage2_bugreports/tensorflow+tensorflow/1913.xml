	<summary>Tensorboard is missing css in lib/</summary>
	<description>
I've noticed that since April 2016 built python wheel files are missing css in tensorboard/lib.
Take a look at those two builds from Jenkins:

13.04.2016
31.03.2016
and compare the contents of wheel file:

This causes issues when trying to run tensorboard after installation of wheel file.
Manual installation from source provides the same result as above.
