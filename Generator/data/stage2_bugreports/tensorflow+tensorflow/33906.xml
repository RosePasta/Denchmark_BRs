	<summary>Update sample session for build from source instruction docs</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The sample sessions given in the docs are old (Bazel 0.15.1, TensorFlow 1.11, python 2.7)
A new session-copy with the more recent TensorFlow 2.x with Bazel 0.26.1 would be more helpful.
Also, python 2.7 is reaching end-of-life in Jan 2020.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Are you planning to also submit a pull request to fix the issue? Yes.

 Are you saying the instructions to install TF from source uses Bazel 0.15.1? I see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows#setup_for_windows&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Bazel 0.24.1. Am I missing something here. Can you please describe with little more details? Thanks!

 I don't mean in the text instructions. There is a sample configuration session on the instructions page. It drops down with a '+' button.

It is very outdated. Having a newer version can help with installation since many users are facing build failures.

 I agree that the sample configuration is with an older version but it an example to any user how to configure. It is difficult to update this configuration every time when a dependency (python/CUDA/Bazel etc) is changed. Thanks!

 Can you Please take a look at it. Are we updating this in the near future? Thanks!

		I am closing this issue as I think this issue was resolved. There is another  with newer versions in the build-from-source for linux/MacOS &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source&gt;page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!
