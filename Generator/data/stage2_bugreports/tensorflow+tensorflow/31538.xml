I am not able to open the link you have provided.Please, share the correct link.
Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the code snippet to reproduce the issue. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in the Github new issue template.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

When i am trying to install "TensorFlowLiteSwift" library with Cocoapods, getting an error. The link is not working and i think this is the problem. Link is provided by google for downloading the TensorFlowLiteC library.
So i cannot share the correct link because it is google link.
Thanks.

		Are you using the 1.14 TensorFlowLiteSwift CocoaPod? If not, can you try updating to that version?

		The 0.2.0 was an experimental release and it no longer worked. Sorry for your inconvenience.
To solve this problem:
If you specified version in Podfile, update it to 1.14.0.
Run pod update.
Let us know if it works.
