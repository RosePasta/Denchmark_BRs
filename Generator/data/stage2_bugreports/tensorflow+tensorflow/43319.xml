	<summary>Undocumented NotFoundError occurs when using tf.io.gfile.glob() to retrieve files in a non-existent directory</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Chrome OS Linux 5.4.40-04224-g891a6cce2d44
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/a
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Installed from source (pip3 install tensoflow)
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.3.0-rc2-23-gb36436b087 2.3.0
Python version: 3.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/a
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/a
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/a
GPU model and memory: N/a


When globbing files in a directory that does not exist, a non-documented tf.errors.NotFoundError is thrown if we try to wildcard glob files in a non-existent directory. This is not currently documented &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/io/gfile/glob&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Describe the expected behavior
We expect that either a ValueError should be thrown, or the an empty list returned (since no files were matched).
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
files = tf.io.gfile.glob("non_existent_dir/*")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
Issue was first discovered through &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/pull/2339#discussion_r490576170&gt;this PR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for TFX, where we are expecting a ValueError instead of a NotFoundError.

 seems like this is the correct place to put this, as previous issues about tf.io.gfile.glob were also opened here

		Yes sorry the code is in this repo. I have quickly read tfio instead of tf.io

		specifically, looking at stack traces, the tf.errors.NotFoundError is thrown at this line:

		I have tried in colab with TF version &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/16fd1051c7c8131f7f859fd67f02d036/untitled376.ipynb&gt;2.3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Opened a PR with a fix for this (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/43333&gt;PR#43333&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), not sure if this is an error we could be fixing at a deeper level, but proposed changes are linked.

		I would say that the error should be returned instead of silently failing
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[test] λ mkdir a b c
[test] λ ls
a  b  c
[test] λ ls d/*
ls: cannot access 'd/*': No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
