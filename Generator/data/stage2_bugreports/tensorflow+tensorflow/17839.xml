	<summary>Beam search terminology</summary>
	<description>
(This issue is with terminology used in documentation and code. System information not applicable.)
The documentation and code in tf.contrib.seq2seq.BeamSearchDecoder and friends seems to use "beam" to mean "search state", whereas beam conventionally means "a collection of search states". This non-standard usage makes for confusing documentation!
Examples in documentation at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/BeamSearchDecoder&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/BeamSearchDecoder&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
"The BeamSearchDecoder shuffles its beams"
"beam_width: Python integer, the number of beams"
Or in code:



tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/beam_search_decoder.py


         Line 144
      in
      838a8f5






 beam_ids = array_ops.expand_dims( 





The conventional search algorithm terminology as I understand it, and attested by wikipedia (&lt;denchmark-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and recent academic usage (&lt;denchmark-link:http://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/05/Papers/0596.pdf&gt;http://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/05/Papers/0596.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), is that beam search is called beam search because it keeps a beam of search states in memory. The beam refers to the collection of search states, not the individual search states (I presume by the analogy that a beam of light illuminates certain objects but not others that fall outside the beam).

		As I mentioned, I'm looking at documentation and source code, so system information is not applicable. The TensorFlow version I'm looking at the documentation for is r1.6.

		That PR doesn't fix the issue. It's just a straight-up replace of "beam" for "search state" which leaves the documentation ungrammatical or nonsensical in many places. (I'm afraid I don't have bandwidth at the moment to make the docs better though.)

		Contrib seq2seq has moved to tensorflow addons. If this is still an issue, please send a new Issue to that repository.
