I have a problem with the conversion model using template code.
I am running on Jupyter Notebook
This is the template code：
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Convert the model to the TensorFlow Lite format without quantization&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(MODEL_TF)
model_no_quant_tflite = converter.convert()
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Save the model to disk&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

open(MODEL_NO_QUANT_TFLITE, "wb").write(model_no_quant_tflite)
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Convert the model to the TensorFlow Lite format with quantization&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

def representative_dataset():
for i in range(500):
yield([x_train[i].reshape(1, 1)])
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Set the optimization flag.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Enforce integer only quantization&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8]
converter.inference_input_type = tf.int8
converter.inference_output_type = tf.int8
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Provide a representative dataset to ensure we quantize correctly.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

converter.representative_dataset = representative_dataset
model_tflite = converter.convert()
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Save the model to disk&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

open(MODEL_TFLITE, "wb").write(model_tflite)
Output result：
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

		Hi Yan,
Which version are you running? Could you provide a list steps to reproduce your issue?
Also if possible, please also check if tensorflow/lite/python/schema_py_generated file under dist packages exists or have Model class defined.
Thanks,
Hi Maghna,
I re-assign this bug to you in case you have seen similar issues. Feel free to reassign.

		This issue should be fixed with the latest TF code (tf-nightly). Could you try with that let us know if it works?
eg:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install tf-nightly
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(you need to restart your runtime if you are using &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com&gt;https://colab.research.google.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)

Firstly,thank you very much for your message.
What I run in jupyter notebook is   :   ! pip install tensorflow==2.4.0rc0 , so tensorflow should be version 2.4.0and python is 3.7.0
The source code of the model I run:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/hello_world/create_sine_model.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/hello_world/create_sine_model.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Chapter title is " Generate a TensorFlow Lite Model"
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
 in ()
18 # Provide a representative dataset to ensure we quantize correctly.
19 converter.representative_dataset = representative_dataset
---&gt; 20 model_tflite = converter.convert()
21
22 # Save the model to disk
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.lite.python.schema_py_generated' has no attribute 'Model'
But my schema_py_generated file has no code.
I am looking forward to your reply

		Hi Yan,
As Meghna mentioned, please try tf-nightly instead of the RC version for now.

My tf-nightly is already 2.5.0 dev version, but still the same problem

 I was able to run this on tf-nightly with version  (as of today). It also worked for  Here is the link: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tE3bJNXOv1NW1OPncgpLfPb1bk8RZnAE?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tE3bJNXOv1NW1OPncgpLfPb1bk8RZnAE?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(Change EPOCH=1 to EPOCH=500 to exactly get the same results as the hello_world example.)
If it helps, you can use the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/5556749/schema_py_generated.py.zip&gt;schema_py_generated.py.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Marking issue as resolved.

If it helps, you can use the schema_py_generated.py.zip attached here.
Marking issue as resolved.

I ran it in jupyter notebook according to the link you provided, and the same error still appeared.

		I had the same problem and found that schema_py_generated.py did exist in my tensorflow installation, but was empty.
And it was independent of installing freshly or with --upgrade via pip, and for both nightly (several dates) and 2.4 (both rc).
Is there a problem with the pip config?
Anyway, thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MeghnaNatraj&gt;@MeghnaNatraj&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  for the file, this solved the issue for me
Btw., I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/44725&gt;#44725&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is a duplicate of this one

		The problem was with TF release itself (due to a change that was rolled out). However it was fixed soon after - refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41846&gt;#41846&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The latest builds do not have this issue. (or at-least I am unable to reproduce this issue). If you face this issue even now, please create a new issue or post a comment in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41846&gt;#41846&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so we can look into it.
