	<summary>[TF 2.0 Docs] Include @tf.function in site/en/r2/tutorials/generative/cvae.ipynb</summary>
	<description>
Thank you for submitting a TensorFlow documentation issue. Per our GitHub
policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests, and
build/installation issues on GitHub.
The TensorFlow docs are open source! To get involved, read the documentation
contributor guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

site/en/r2/tutorials/generative/cvae.ipynb
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing): implement @tf.function decorators in the computation to improve performance, and highlight one of the tf 2.0 features.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When implementing in colab the performance improves from 30s / epoch average to 3.6s /epoch which is a huge benefit, and well worth highlighting/recommending by adding only 4 lines of code.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I can do that, yes
