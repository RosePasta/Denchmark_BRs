Python 3.6.4
There is a strange error when I install tensorflow 1.5.

Unknown requires Python '&gt;=2.6, &lt;3' but the running Python is 3.6.4
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Why the dependency is futures? It doesn't have a verion of Python 3.6.4.

		It is hard to understand your problem without complete information.  What installation method do you use?

		I have a same problem on the Ubuntu 16.04. I use pip to get the Python 3.5 binary file. And it is strange that Python 3 doesn't need the futures package.

 Could you please specify what method you use to install TensorFlow?

 I used the native pip to install tensorflow-gpu with the version of Python 3.5. When the pip install the dependency, the problem occurred. Like this one:

		Same problem here on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.5.
Clearly, Python 3 doesn't need futures.  And with Python 2.7, using :
pip2 install tensorflow-gpu==1.5.0
it goes well.
Here's a solution for Python 3:
The error is occurred when installing the version of futures 3.2.0 for Python 3. It is noticed that:

It should not be installed on Python 3, although there should be no harm in doing so, as the standard library takes precedence over third party libraries.

First, install futures 3.1.1:
 pip3 install futures==3.1.1
then :
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.5.0
Do not add the --ignore-installed or -I

		Thanks for previous solution.

		I think this issue should be reopened.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/WongChen&gt;@WongChen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has posted a workaround, but this is still a bug in tensorflow's dependency setup, is it not?

, I think it's a bug as well.

		i'd argue this is more a problem with futures, not with TF since TF's requirement with futures is 3.1.1+ which works fine on Python3.6
		</comment>
		<comment id='11' author='duxingzhe' date='2018-01-30T08:41:55Z'>
		I think the problem here is that futures &gt; 3.1.1 is not allowed to be installed for py3.
see &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Since pip install the newest version, the error is occurred.
If you google it, you can find many errors just like this.
On the other side, I think tf for py3 package's dependency .

		ah, my bad. i assumed that it was ok to install futures 3.1.1 for python 3 but seems like they just forgot to check the version.

 Could you please take a look at tensorboard dependency on futures?
		</comment>
		<comment id='14' author='duxingzhe' date='2018-01-31T03:59:12Z'>
		I think the problem is caused by tensorboard dependency, it requires futures &gt;= 3.1.1.

Collecting futures&gt;=3.1.1 (from tensorflow-tensorboard&lt;1.6.0,&gt;=1.5.0-&gt;tensorflow)
futures requires Python '&gt;=2.6, &lt;3' but the running Python is 3.6.4

 You are correct. It is tensorboard issue. See tensorflow/tensorboard/&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/916&gt;#916&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. tensorflow/tensorboard/&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/920&gt;#920&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 PR fixes the problem.

		pip3 install futures==3.1.1
pip3 install tensorflow==1.14.0  not work

		Please open new issue, this is for Tf 1.5 which is no longer supported.
Locking conversation since this issue has been solved in 2018.
