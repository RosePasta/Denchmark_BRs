	<summary>file_io.get_matching_files fails if any unrelated (non-matching) sub-directory is non-readable</summary>
	<description>
Let filename = "/tmp/mymodel.005".
file_io.get_matching_files(filename) will raise an exception like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;PermissionDeniedError: /tmp/.xrdp/xrdp-sesman-jjz1ox
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

for me. I think this is a bug as this is an unrelated (non-matching) directory, so it does not matter and it will anyway not match the filename, thus it should not raise an exception.
I get this via saver.restore(sess=..., save_path=filename) where saver = tf.train.Saver(...).

 The underlying  performs a pattern matching on all files in the directory.

		Yes I see that it does that (and even for all sub directories) but it shouldn't break on sub directories which do not match anyway.

		It add all sub folders before doing the match, and the error is thrown when checking if it is a directory.

		I know. And I say that this should not fail if it does not match the pattern anyway.

		yup you're right... the directory check shouldn't need to be done on children that don't match the pattern. That check is done for adding stuff to the queues but not for the IsDirectory check. I'll fix this.

		I believe commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/493188ebe0f68ace157bd97453c41e2cb0d642c8&gt;493188e&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should have fixed this issue.
Can you verify and make sure things work fine now?
