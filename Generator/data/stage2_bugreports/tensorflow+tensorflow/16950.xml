	<summary>Windows Installation tutorial has wrong cuDNN version requirement, 7 required for latest version.</summary>
	<description>
Inaccuracies in the documentation.
In the installation documentation Tensorflow in Windows says that the system must be running a version of CUDA 9.0 (correctly) and cuDNN 6.0 (not correct) because on the Nvidia website we can download and install only:

cuDNN v7.0.5 , for CUDA 8.0/9.0/9.1 ;
cuDNN v7.0.4 , for CUDA 8.0/9.0 ;
cuDNN v6.0 , for CUDA 8.0 .

In &lt;denchmark-link:https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/01/announcing-tensorflow-15.html&gt;https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/01/announcing-tensorflow-15.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said that

If you are using GPU Acceleration on Windows or Linux, TensorFlow 1.5 now has CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7 support built-in.

In issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/16477&gt;#16477&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/16477&gt;#16477&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)  as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gunan&gt;@gunan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  said

Windows also requires cuDNN 7, looks like we missed that.

In proof of his words let me give you output logs:

ImportError: Could not find . TensorFlow requires that this DLL be installed in a directory that is named in your %PATH% environment variable. Note that installing cuDNN is a separate step from installing CUDA, and this DLL is often found in a different directory from the CUDA DLLs. You may install the necessary DLL by downloading  from this URL: &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn&gt;https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In conclusion.
Need to replace:

cuDNN  v6.0. For details, see NVIDIA's documentation. Note that cuDNN is typically installed in a different location from the other CUDA DLLs. Ensure that you add the directory where you installed the cuDNN DLL to your %PATH% environment variable.

to

cuDNN v7.0. For details, see NVIDIA's documentation. Note that cuDNN is typically installed in a different location from the other CUDA DLLs. Ensure that you add the directory where you installed the cuDNN DLL to your %PATH% environment variable.

		This looks to me like it's been fixed in the repository.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/install/install_windows.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/docs_src/install/install_windows.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please reopen if I've misread things.
