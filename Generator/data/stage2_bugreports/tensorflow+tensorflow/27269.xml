you can click the links of other functions in the same page and you'll find the expected link.
Then a pullrequest.

		Actually tf.logging is removed in new version of TF that is 2.0.0 so that's why the link their is of no use as tensorflow is focussing to change complete documentation for TF2.0. You can also refer to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26662&gt;#26662&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Faced no logging module in tensorflow 2.0, which is obvious. Any update on this?
And if logging is not available in tensorflow 2.0 what is the alternative for logging, pure python logging?

pure python logging?

I think that's it, or absl_py logging?
