I have checked everywhere else for a solution and this is my last resort
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with the
documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go
here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script
provided in TensorFlow):no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Windows 10 v2004

Python version: 3.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0 + 7.5.0 , 9.2 + 7.5.0 and 9.0 7.5.0
GPU model and memory: GTX 1060 6g
Exact command to reproduce:

 Can you please check your CUDnn version as mentioned &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45641087/on-windows-how-do-you-verify-the-version-number-of-cudnn-installed&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can you please verify it once again. Thanks!

		I found out the cause, apparently there was a version of cudnn in my main windows directory and sure enough it was 7.3.1, I deleted it and everything is working fine now, sorry for wasting you guys's time.

		I too have the same issue:
os: ubuntu 18.
CUDA is 10.0
CUDNN is 7.5
Tensorflow 1.15.2
GPU : 1060Ti 6gb
#define CUDNN_MAJOR 7
#define CUDNN_MINOR 5
#define CUDNN_PATCHLEVEL 0
Loaded runtime CuDNN library: 7.5.0 but source was compiled with: 7.6.0.  CuDNN library major and minor version needs to match or have higher minor version in case of CuDNN 7.0 or later version. If using a binary install, upgrade your CuDNN library.  If building from sources, make sure the library loaded at runtime is compatible with the version specified during compile configuration.
can anyone help me plz.
Thank you!

		upgrade your cudnn to 7.6.0 download &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 u may need to make an nvidia dev account if you don't have one

Solution 1: ( I don't have root-access) so I have downgraded the TensorFlow version from 1.15.2 to 1.14. It worked for me.
Solution 2: As per &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wesleyr36&gt;@wesleyr36&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said we can upgrade the cudnn version in my case it is 7.6
refer this link &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for compactable versions

		I'm on CUDNN 7.5/Python 3.6 and downgrading to 1.14 like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ashiqak&gt;@ashiqak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 worked for me too !
pip3 install tensorflow_gpu==1.14
