	<summary>TFRecord documentation is still lacking</summary>
	<description>

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).

&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information (N/A)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1749&gt;#1749&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was closed with the note that "We revamped our docs. Feel free to open a new issue if this is still missing from our new docs."
Despite being the "recommended format" for input data, I still can't find any official documentation on creating TFRecords, and what the best practices are surrounding this task.
It seems strange that blogs and the source code are the only sources of information on this. I think it would be a good idea to have an official guide showing how to go from a directory of images to some TFRecords. Maybe using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/inception/inception/data/build_imagenet_data.py&gt;this script from tensorflow/models&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as an example.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs (N/A)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
