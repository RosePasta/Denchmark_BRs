	<summary>docs: Broken link/missing py file in Model Files guide</summary>
	<description>
On the page &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/tool_developers/&gt;"A Tool Developer's Guide to TensorFlow Model Files"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/how_tos/tool_developers/index.md&gt;GitHub md link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
In the GraphDef section, there's a link to , pointing to the url &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/graph_metrics.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/graph_metrics.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This url does not exist. Perhaps it's intended to point at a different file in that folder? I don't see an obvious suitable replacement from scanning the filenames listed: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/tools&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/tools&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 This one of your doc files?

		graph_metrics.py was removed, so we should update the docs.
