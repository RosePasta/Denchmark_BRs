		linear is deprecated and shouldn't be used by external users. I'll look
through and see if we use it anywhere but internally in tf.nn.

		Closing because folks shouldn't be using linear.  But let me know if this breaks any existing models in python3 and i'll reopen.

: could you please help reopen linear? I am trying to execute the code provided here by Alex (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/atpaino/deep-text-corrector&gt;https://github.com/atpaino/deep-text-corrector&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		You can find a version of the function _linear in an old version of
tensorflow (check the older version branches).  Copy and paste it into your
own codebase and use it there.  We will not be making it public.
