	<summary>keras.Model.fit error with 2.4 and TPUv3</summary>
	<description>
My code is worked in 2.3 and 2.4 with GPU. And it is failed when doing "keras.Model.fit" in Cloud TPU with 2.4, but worked in 2.3.1 and nightly.
In the past, this error is only encountered when the TensorFlow version in TPU does not fully matched the version in VM.
