	<summary>Tutorial on basic classification needs some documentation improvement</summary>
	<description>
Thank you for submitting a TensorFlow documentation issue. Per our GitHub
policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests, and
build/installation issues on GitHub.
The TensorFlow docs are open source! To get involved, read the documentation
contributor guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

One of the first step-by-step tutorial which explains a neural network is on Basic Classification &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification/&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, it can benefit from additional explanations on few terms like overfitting, optimizer etc.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We add one line description for overfitting  to help user get a first hand idea of what overfitting does. Later, we add an extra line with a link to TensorFlow definition of overfit where user can find more information. The suggested changes  are expected to make it easier for users to get an intuitive understanding of the term.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Correct links&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is the link to the source code correct? Yes
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
