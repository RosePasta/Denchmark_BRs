	<summary>tf_upgrade_v2 needs explicit encodings on Windows to upgrade utf-8</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary x64
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.2.0-rc4-8-g2b96f3662b 2.2.0
Python version: 3.8.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: Tesla K80, 1080ti (11GB per gpu)

Describe the current behavior
Running tf_upgrade_v2 yields encoding errors on Windows, even with defaults set to utf-8 (though no explicit encodings in each file -- as this isn't required in Python 3).
Adding explicit encoding to tensorflow\tools\compatibility\ast_edits.py as shown below resolved this for me -- if a default of utf-8 isn't desirable maybe a command line option?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    # Write to a temporary file, just in case we are doing an implace modify.
    # pylint: disable=g-backslash-continuation
    with open(in_filename, "r", encoding='utf-8') as in_file, \
        tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile("w", delete=False, encoding='utf-8') as temp_file:
      ret = self.process_opened_file(in_filename, in_file, out_filename,
                                     temp_file)
    # pylint: enable=g-backslash-continuation
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
