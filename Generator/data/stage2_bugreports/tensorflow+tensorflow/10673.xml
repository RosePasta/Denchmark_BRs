	<summary>Public head of master is failing windows CMAKE tests (?)</summary>
	<description>
The following tests are failing for several of the public pull requests.  I suggest that the current head of master would also fail in the same way.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The following tests FAILED:
	171 - C:/tf_jenkins/home/workspace/tensorflow-pr-win-cmake-py/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/sparse_ops_test.py (Failed)
	173 - C:/tf_jenkins/home/workspace/tensorflow-pr-win-cmake-py/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/sparse_reshape_op_test.py (Failed)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I'll revise that.  Looking at the history of the Windows CMAKE tests, I can see that this test has been failing on and off for quite a while (didn't go back to the origin to find out who actually broke it)

		Flake was due to a new numpy version. Should be fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/10709&gt;#10709&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gunan&gt;@gunan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 re-downloaded numpy afterward.
