	<summary>tf.keras is ignoring specified step_per_epoch when keras doesn't</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):unknown
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):colab
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.13
Python version:python 3
Bazel version (if compiling from source):unknown
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):unknown
CUDA/cuDNN version:unknown
GPU model and memory:unknown

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"


If train_generator is a instance of Sequence.( in my case, coming from flow_from_directory), steps_per_epoch is overridden by len(train_generator) in this file &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.13/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training_generator.py#L371&gt;training_generator.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This doesn't happen in keras. In keras, steps_per_epoch is kept.
Describe the expected behavior
Use specified steps_per_epoch instead of len(data) if specified.

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
I find this when doing a coursera online course. The notebook i used can be found at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/Course%201%20-%20Part%208%20-%20Lesson%202%20-%20Notebook.ipynb&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		This is not Build/Installation or Bug/Performance issue. Please post this kind of support questions at &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. There is a big community to support and learn from your questions. GitHub is mainly for addressing bugs in installation and performance. Thanks!

 I understand what is happening. I don't need stackoverflown for clarification.
The problem I'm reporting is that the parameter is not working as expected in tf.keras, and is behaving differently in keras and tf.keras. I heard that you are trying to keep tf.keras api in agreement with keras. This could be fixed on either ends to make them behave the same.

		got the same issue with the last keras and tensorflow:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tf.__version__, tf.keras.__version__
('1.13.1', '2.2.4-tf')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

model.fit_generator just ignores steps_per_epoch parameter.

		Thanks for the issue! It seems reasonable to prefer steps_per_epoch (if provided) over the Sequence length, will look into this

		Looks like this has already been fixed in the TF 2.0 nightly

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
