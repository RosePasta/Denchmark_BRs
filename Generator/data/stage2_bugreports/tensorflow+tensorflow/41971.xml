	<summary>Error in nce_loss using intermediate layer output</summary>
	<description>

System information
tensorflow version on my machine v2.2.0-rc4-8-g2b96f3662b 2.2.
I am trying to use the nce_loss by passing the second to last layer's ouput to this loss function, then I got error

OperatorNotAllowedInGraphError: using a tf.Tensor as a Python bool is not allowed in Graph execution. Use Eager execution or decorate this function with @tf.function.
