	<summary>Persistent GradientTape not working with LSTM</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes. Adapted code from this tutorial
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 Build 1903
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.7.7

Describe the current behavior
Training a model with tf.keras.layers.LSTM  and  custom train_step that uses a tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) is
stuck at the first batch. The python process slowly uses all available RAM.
Describe the expected behavior
The model should train the same way as when using persistent=False.

		I have tried in colab with TF versions 2.2,nightly versions() and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/6f20f5647385a1841529f98b9de85066/untitled93.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

		Seems to happen with GRU as well but not SimpleRNN. Possibly related to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39697&gt;#39697&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?

, I think this is the same issue as  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39697&gt;#39697&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and tf core team is trying to address it. Please track the progress in  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39697&gt;#39697&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I am closing this issue for now.
