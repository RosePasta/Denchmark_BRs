&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/AggregationMethod&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/AggregationMethod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

While opening the link on this page, I am getting redirected to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/gradients_util.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/gradients_util.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which is the correct link mentioned in the issue. It's working fine I think.
Seems like most of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atype%3Adocs+%5BTF+2.0+API+Docs%5D+is%3Aopen&gt;these issues&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with broken links were solved.

		How to use tf.AggregationMethod in tf2.0.
In tf1.0 it can be passthrough the
optimizer.minimize(loss, method_aggregation =  tf.AggregationMethod.EXPERIMANTAL_TREE)
And it can help if GPU is OOM.
But how to use that in TF 2.0?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chinmoysarangi&gt;@chinmoysarangi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Paige has a &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs_ref&gt;lot of these bugs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I doubt she working on this particular one right now.
Also if you're working on api pages be sure to have a look at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs_ref&gt;this doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
