	<summary>Docs: incomplete description of callbacks.ModelCheckpoint's save_best_only parameter</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


mode: "{auto, min, max}" should be {auto, min, max}, I guess (minor)
save_best_only: I believe the description is incomplete. With save_best_only=True, not only will "the latest best model [...] not be overwritten": but also the current model is not written at all, even if it has another filename than the "latest best model". This is kind of implied by the name of the parameter, but the description should include that, too.
