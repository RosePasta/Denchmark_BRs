Describe the current behavior
When I try to save a tensorflow model to disk, it has recently started giving this error - "tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError". It used to work for over a month without issues, and nothing has changed as far as I know; but now, giving the error. I tried saving the model as a pickle file like this --&gt; dnn_classifier.save("/path/m.pkl") and also without the .pkl extension like dnn_classifier.save("/path/m").    I observe that the "assets" folder and the "saved_model.pb" files are not getting created.
Describe the expected behavior
The "assets" folder and the "saved_model.pb" files should get created.
