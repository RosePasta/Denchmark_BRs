System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): osx
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: none
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.14.1-dev20190509
Python version: 3.7.1
Bazel version (if compiling from source):None
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):None
CUDA/cuDNN version:None
GPU model and memory:None

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
tf.enable_v2_behavior()


@tf.function
def test_rank(x):
    return x


test_rank_cf = test_rank.get_concrete_function(tf.TensorSpec([None, None], tf.float32))
# run smoothly, should raise errors here?
test_rank_cf(tf.random.normal((2, 3, 4)))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Errors should be rasied if inputs and tf.TensorSpec are not compatible with each other
Code to reproduce the issue
See the above
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

		I was able to replicate the behavior with TensorFlow 1.14.1-dev20190509 on Colab.

 I think it is working as expected. Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/c7fde452c04e77184a796f4a700cb80d/untitled196.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
When I provide input of int32, it throws an error as the op is looking for float32. I added this line in the end
test_rank_cf(tf.fill([2,3,4],3))   # this throws an error as input is int32 whereas it was expecting float32
Thanks!

 means that the tensor provided for this concrete function should be a Tensor of rank two and tf.float32 as dtype, neither a mismatch with dtype nor rank should raise errors, in your example, there is a mismatch between dtype, so this concrete function exactly raises errors on the mismatch of dtype as it is expected to do, but  is a tensor of rank three, not rank two, so errors should also be raised.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# this line should raise errors, but it doesn't
test_rank_cf(tf.cast(tf.fill((2, 3, 4), 3), tf.float32))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This is somewhat working as intended. By design concretefunction performs very little validation; you trade this against getting very low python overhead at execution time.
If you want validation pass a signature argument to tf.function and then call it.
