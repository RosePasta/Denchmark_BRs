	<summary>Better documentation for Dataset.from_tensors/from_tensor_slices</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#from_tensor_slices&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#from_tensor_slices&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

While following Google's ML crash course, I found it very difficult to understand the difference between Dataset.from_tensors/from_tensor_slices and when to use each. One thing that confused me was that from_tensors only creates a single tensor, despite the name including the plural form "tensors".
Beginners get introduced to these APIs very early, but the current documentation consists of one terse sentence about behaviour (plus a multi-line warning about memory usage):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;FTS:
Creates a Dataset whose elements are slices of the given tensors.

FT:
Creates a Dataset with a single element, comprising the given tensors.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think this would benefit from some elaboration and a clearer description of how the two are related. Given that users enocunter this API very early, the behaviour should ideally be obvious. A small example would help communicate this, e.g:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;my_data = { "my_feature" : [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ] }
tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors(my_data) # Models a single, 2x3 tensor.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;my_data = { "my_feature" : [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] ] }
tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(my_data) # Splits on rows. Models two, 1x3 tensors.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Correct links&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Fine AFAIK
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Parameters defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Fine AFAIK
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Returns defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Fine AFAIK
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Raises listed and defined&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Fine AFAIK
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Usage example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is currently no usage example, and I think the documentation would greatly benefit from one.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Request visuals, if applicable&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are currently no visuals. They might possibly help, but I think a usage example is probably sufficient.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm not sure if I'll submit a PR to improve this. I'd like to, but I'm still quite new to TF and wouldn't like to introduce any inaccuracies.
