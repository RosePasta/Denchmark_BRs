Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The currently published tutorial for &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/monitors&gt;Logging and Monitoring&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is based on functionality that has been identified as  (see i.p. the discussion in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7669&gt;#7669&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .)
I truly appreciate all the hard work ðŸ’¯  put into moving the functionality of TF itself forward.
It would be most appreciated, if this tutorial could be updated to reflect suggested best practices when using sessionRunHook et al. to ease adoptabilty of TF.

, were you, or did you, already sign up to do this?

		The new Programmer's Guide will go out with V1.3.  However, we may add a
few additional chapters after 1.3 is released.

		Is there an update on the timing for this issue's resolution?
And a slightly more general contextual question, Is there a tracking reference to see which parts of the Programmer's Guide/Tutorials are current with Release 1.3 or still awaiting update as per &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jugglerix&gt;@jugglerix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 above comment?
As always, thanks for the hard work!

		A few notes:

The "Logging and Monitoring Basics with tf.contrib.learn" document was removed from tensorflow.org.
The tutorial entitled "A Guide to TF Layers: Building a Convolutional Neural Network" demonstrates how to use SessionRunHook to set up logging during training.
