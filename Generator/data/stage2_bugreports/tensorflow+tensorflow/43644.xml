You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

I then ran the inference through sample_detection.py.

TRTEngineOp is there, but it is not used for inference.
The defined TRTEngineOp should be used for inference.

As you have mentioned you are using tf version 1.13 which is very old version and there is no support for tf 1.x versions can you please upgrade to 2.x versions and let us know if this is still an issue.Thanks!
