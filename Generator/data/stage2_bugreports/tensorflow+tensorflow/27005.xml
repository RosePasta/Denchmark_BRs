		Removing:

In addition, variants of these types with the _ref suffix are defined for reference-typed tensors.

As well as:
DType(T)       .is_compatible_with(DType(T).as_ref) == True
DType(T).as_ref.is_compatible_with(DType(T))        == False
DType(T).as_ref.is_compatible_with(DType(T).as_ref) == True
from the reference documentation. Thanks for alerting us to this issue!
