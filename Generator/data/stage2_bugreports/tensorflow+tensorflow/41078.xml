	<summary>Dataset error with uc_merced dataset</summary>
	<description>
System information

Using Google Colab's default TF installation
TensorFlow version: 2.2.0
Python version: 3.6

Describe the current behavior
Dataset's samples are not all of the expected 256x256x3 shape, I found 44 out of 2100 samples with different shape. Currently, during preprocessing, I have to rescale the image if necessary.
Describe the expected behavior
All samples should have 256x256x3 shape.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

dataset, info = tfds.load('uc_merced',
                            split='train',
                            as_supervised=True,
                            with_info=True,
                            shuffle_files=True)

exp_shape = (256, 256, 3)
n = 0
for sample in dataset.take(-1):
    if sample[0].shape != exp_shape:
        n += 1

print('Found {} samples with wrong shape'.format(n))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
Found 44 samples with wrong shape

This may seem to be a problem with the original dataset (&lt;denchmark-link:http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html&gt;http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). If a fix is not possible, it may be a good idea to add a note in the documentation page &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/uc_merced&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/uc_merced&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to let new users know about the issue.
Alternatively, a possible solution that the user would have to implement is something like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def correct_dims(x, y):
    some_resizing_function(x, (256, 256, 3))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and after loading the dataset:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;dataset = dataset.map(correct_dims)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
