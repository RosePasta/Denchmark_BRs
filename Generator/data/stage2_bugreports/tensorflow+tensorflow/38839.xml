System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Tried on Windows 10 and on Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): tried 2.0.0 and 2.0.1
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.repeat(['a', 'b', 'c'], repeats=[3, 0, 2], axis=0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'repeat'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
I found that this works on 2.1.0 and 1.15.2

		It works in tf 2.2 as well. Also as you mentioned in tf 2.1 and 1.15 as well.
It does not work in 2.0.1. I checked it. Here is gist to reproduce error. &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/oke-aditya/d7d29ab4362dbb67fff7149bcc795390/test2.ipynb&gt;error_test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

we ran your code over nightly and it does not have any errors,please find the&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/a54afe6ca3b701d71af0432083c642df/38839.ipynb&gt; gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

is there any particular reason to run on 2.0.1, can you upgrade to later versions.

I can definitely use other versions, up to you :-0. Just FYI, at the moment, version 2.0.1 and 2.0.0 don't work. Furthermore, 2.1.0 has repeat and work in Linux, however, if I try to install 2.1.0 on my local windows laptop, it fails.
The summary is that, given that I only use stable releases, from the recent versions I can only use 1.15.2. I'll do that for the time being.
