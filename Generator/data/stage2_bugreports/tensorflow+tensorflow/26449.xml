Describe the documentation issue
None of &lt;denchmark-link:http://tensorflow.org&gt;http://tensorflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  is working on Safari (latest macOS) for me; seems related to Service Worker. Works fine on Safari Technology Preview and on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleChrome&gt;@GoogleChrome&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Might have visited the page during the last 48h (pre-launch).

		@eivind88 It is working on my Mac without any problem. Could you check it by clearing cache and reload it. Thanks!

		Emptied cache, and did a hard reload and got the site.
Did another normal reload – same error.
Restarted Safari, and it's the same thing.
Can only seem to get the new site when ignoring cache and reloading using alt+cmd+R (no hero-graphics, though) – every normal reload gives me the same error. Emptying my cache does nothing.
I'm thinking there's been an error with whatever service worker I hit first during the last couple of days, which leads to bad cache-handling in the browser.

		These seem related:

		Thanks. Tested on Safari and this issue seems resolved when the redesign rollout completed.

Actually, if this is what I suspect it is (bungled service worker at some point) you wouldn't be able to reproduce this issue if you didn't access the site at the same time as I must have originally done (at the time when the service worker was incorrect).
I'm still having the exact same issue.

		I can file an internal ticket, but will need to be able to reproduce the issue. Is there anything about your setup that needs to be taken into account? (JavaScript blockers, etc.) Thanks

		Hi @eivind88, I've filed an internal issue.
Can you load the site with the developer console open and let us know if there are any errors in the console? Thank you

		Hey, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Nothing in the console when loading:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/939844/55173423-113eb080-5152-11e9-948e-efbf3288eaee.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I empty the cache and reload, there's a bunch. All of them include "TypeError: Failed writing data to the file system" or otherwise failing to load resources. This is also similar to the Safari error-screen I see when trying to load the page normally, which is part of why I think it's related to service workers.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/939844/55173604-5f53b400-5152-11e9-856c-02f02f5b2062.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		@eivind88 are you experiencing this problem on all sites with Service Workers?
e.g. airhorner.com, chromestatus.com
There's very little control about where we store things—SW just lets us put data into Cache.

 no problem anywhere else.

		Still tracking this webserver bug internally but closing this since it's not a TensorFlow issue. Thanks
