	<summary>Request for documentation: quantize_training in python</summary>
	<description>
Poking around, I find &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=quantize_training&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=quantize_training&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However there is no documents that I can find describe how this can be used. Can we add some example and also documentation around it so that people can start to play with it?

 Is this deprecated code?

		Hi, the quantized training rewrites are documented and available here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/quantize&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/quantize&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Note, they will not work on all models, though we are working on improving how well they generalize.
You can convert these Fake quantized models to fully quantized mobile models via TensorFlow Lite.
