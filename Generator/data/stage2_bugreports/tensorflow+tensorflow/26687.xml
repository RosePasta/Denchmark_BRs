	<summary>Iterate on dataset/iterator when using @tf.function</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Archlinux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0-dev20190312
Python version: 3.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10
GPU model and memory: 1080 Ti

Describe the current behavior
Can't convert the dataset/iterator to its graph representation: I'm forced to loop in eager mode, but I want to have a graph representation of the loop too (since I need to export a SavedModel that contains the loop itself).
Describe the expected behavior
The iterator / the dataset should be converted in its graph representation.
Code to reproduce the issue
A code that loops using Tensorflow primitives (like for i in tf.range(10)) can be converted into its graph representation without any problem, while a code that creates a python iterator from a dataset object (using iter(dataset)) can't.
Moreover, maybe because we are in the early stage of the development, I'm unable to convert a loop that loops over a dataset to its graph representation.
import tensorflow as tf

def real_gen():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(real_gen, (tf.float32))

@tf.function
def itertest():
    tf.print(next(iter(dataset)))
itertest()

@tf.function
def loopiter():
    for real in dataset:
        tf.print(real)
loopiter()
The itertest() call fails because RuntimeError: dataset.__iter__() is only supported when eager execution is enabled.
While the loopiter() call fails because tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: Function __inference_Dataset_flat_map_flat_map_fn_22 is not defined. [[{{node ReduceDataset}}]] [Op:__inference_loopiter_35]

		I am closing this issue as this should now be supported as for TF 1.14 and TF 2.0-beta. Please verify and if you encounter a problem re-open this issue with up-to-date information.
