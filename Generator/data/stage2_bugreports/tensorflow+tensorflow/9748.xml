	<summary>Segmentation fault on help(tf.train.SequenceExample)</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to try and test the tf.train.SequenceExample class, but it wasn't in the official docs and using help crashed Python. Does anyone know how to use it or how to solve this issue?

		Please provide a simple repro case and we can look into it.
Also, which version/OS/etc.

		My Tensorflow version is 1.1.0-rc2 (GPU, Python 3.5) on Ubuntu 16.04.
Some information from :
system='Linux',
release='4.4.0-72-generic',
version='&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/93&gt;#93&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 31 14:07:41 UTC 2017',
machine='x86_64',
processor='x86_64'
import tensorflow as tf
help(tf.train.SequenceExample)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
The same problem happened when I tried to call the related classes such as help(tf.train.Feature).
Although I eventually figured out how to use tf.train.SequenceExample, this remains an issue to other users that are not familiar with it.

 could it be related to decorators?

		Sounds like a reasonable starting point, I'll take a look.

 It doesn't seem like a tf_decorator issue.
Compare
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/v1.1.0-rc2/tensorflow/python/util&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/v1.1.0-rc2/tensorflow/python/util&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/util&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/python/util&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

See that tf_decorator exists in 'master' but not in 1.1.0-rc2. I don't think the decorator work had landed when 1.1.0-rc2 was cut.

 is it just  or anything else? Can you call , say  for instance? Does  fail for anything else?

		To be more specific, segmentation fault only happened when I called help(*) with the following tf.train.Example-related classes:
# tf.train.Example
# tf.train.SequenceExample
#
#   tf.train.Features
#   tf.train.FeatureLists
#
#       tf.train.Feature    
#       tf.train.FeatureList
#
#         tf.train.Int64List
#         tf.train.FloatList
#         tf.train.BytesList
In contrast, help(*) with the following worked normally.
tf.train.AdamOptimizer
tf.train.Coordinator
tf.train.Saver
tf.train.Supervisor

tf.train.batch
tf.train.queue_runner

		It looks like it's a protobuf issue. We're working on that.
It should also crash with tf.GraphDef.
I could not repro on my system, though. It could be because you have loaded another protobuf via load_op_library, or something to do with protobuf on your system.
I'm closing in favor of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/9525&gt;#9525&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
