Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: - Bazel
version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from
source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
After saving and loading the model the output of the layer is different.
Describe the expected behavior
The output should be the same

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

 Thank you for the feedback!
AutoKeras is pending on this issue for the next release.
So it would be good to have an estimated timeline of resolving this issue,
so that our team can better coordinate to figure out a solution on our side.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/haifeng-jin&gt;@haifeng-jin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - because IndexLookup isn't officially exported yet, we need to treat it as a custom symbol. Can you try adding custom_objects={"IndexLookup": preprocessing.index_lookup.IndexLookup} to your load_model call? This worked for me at head in nightly.
