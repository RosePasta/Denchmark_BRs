	<summary>bug in Using the SavedModel format Guide</summary>
	<description>
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with the
documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go
here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ubuntu 18.04, system with two GPUs, tensorflow 2.2
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The guide, near the top, includes the following:
physical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if physical_devices:
tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
and on a multi-GPU system, this will lead to problems later because memory growth will only be managed on one of the GPUs.  It should instead be:
physical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
for device in physical_devices:
tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(device, True)
I am aware that this is really a minor documentation issue, and would prefer to simply upload the fix myself.  Unfortunately, I am not willing to sign the Contributor License Agreement.  I have many friends at Google with whom I have many technical discussions.  I don't want those discussions to automatically grant licenses to Google if I forget to say "not a contribution" at the beginning of them.

  Can you help me locate this piece of code.
I have tried to find this but was unable to locate may be you can help me.

		The page is at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I've
attached it as an ipynb file.  The lines in question are 128-130

In fact, this whole page is sort of terrible.  So on line 115, tmpdir is
set to tempfile.mkdtemp() and then the model is saved to
mobilenet_save_path, which is defined to be tmpdir/mobilenet on line 343.
But then on lines 471-475, the model server is invoked on /tmp/mobilenet,
which is not where the model actually is on my system.  I fixed that as
well, but then the tensorflow_model_server call actually fails with a fatal
error (something about not being able to open the connection to port 8501
written to the server log; let me know if you need me to go dig it up).  At
that point, I gave up.

Thanks for taking a look!

		Hi, may I submit a PR to fix this? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aavishkarmishra&gt;@aavishkarmishra&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Sorry, I didn't see the attached .ipynb file, could you please remind me where it locates? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mattginsberg&gt;@mattginsberg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yes, certainly submit a PR.  I can't submit a PR because I'm not willing to
sign the thing that says I have to curtail my conversations with all my
friends at Google!

The .ipynb file is what you get if you click "Download notebook" at
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Hopefully that is what you need -- thanks!

		Just tried out the notebook. There is no issue for me in the original notebook. Maybe that's a very specific memory issue for you?
And both

and

works for me. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mattginsberg&gt;@mattginsberg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yes.  It will fail on a machine with multiple GPUs because only the first
gets its memory growth managed.  This will eventually cause a problem
("Memory growth cannot differ between GPU devices") at

pretrained_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNet()

later on the page.
