I am trying to employing CollectiveAllReduceStrategy upon tensorflow official model resnet following the instructions from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute#multi-worker-training&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute#multi-worker-training&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Code: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/threeleafzerg/models&gt;https://github.com/threeleafzerg/models&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Steps:

Prepare dataset: python3 cifar10_download_and_extract.py --${PWD}/cifar_data
Start Worker1: https://github.com/threeleafzerg/models/blob/master/official/resnet/worker1.sh
Start Worker2: https://github.com/threeleafzerg/models/blob/master/official/resnet/worker2.sh
I expect that the distributed training could start successfully.

But unfortunately, I got python exceptions.
File "/home/zhouhaiy/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/resource_variable_ops.py", line 403, in _init_from_arg s

'Parameter group_size to broadcast_send must be at least 2.')
ValueError: Parameter group_size to broadcast_send must be at least 2.
Describe the expected behavior
Distributed training can start successfully.

I have uploaded my experiment code in my private branch: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/threeleafzerg/models&gt;https://github.com/threeleafzerg/models&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		byronyi,
Thanks for your quick response.
Following your instructions, I install tf-nightly. I found two issues with tf-nightly build.

There's bug in this line: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/distribute/estimator_training.py#L302. It should be "if 'evaluator' in cluster_spec.jobs:".
After fix 1) bug, it complains that we should use standalone client mode when using estimator.train
File "/home/zhouhaiy/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tensorflow_estimator/python/estimator/estimator.py", line 1180, in _train_model_distributed
hooks)
File "/home/zhouhaiy/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/tensorflow/python/distribute/estimator_training.py", line 310, in estimator_train
raise ValueError('Only STANDALONE_CLIENT mode is supported when you call '
ValueError: Only STANDALONE_CLIENT mode is supported when you call estimator.train

So I followed the following post to launch standalone client. But I still met the issue. Can you help check whether there's any issue in my procedure?
Post: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute#standalone-client-mode&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute#standalone-client-mode&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Step:

Launch cluster.
`#!/bin/bash

export TF_CONFIG='{
"cluster": {
"worker": ["192.168.20.50:1111", "192.168.20.52:1112"]
},
"task": {"type": "worker", "index": 0}
}'
python3 tf_std_server.pyand #!/bin/bash
export TF_CONFIG='{
"cluster": {
"worker": ["192.168.20.50:1111", "192.168.20.52:1112"]
},
"task": {"type": "worker", "index": 1}
}'
python3 tf_std_server.py`
tf_std_server.py is from ecosystem. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem/blob/master/distribution_strategy/tf_std_server.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem/blob/master/distribution_strategy/tf_std_server.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

2. Change Distribute Config
  distribution_strategy = collective_all_reduce_strategy.CollectiveAllReduceStrategy( num_gpus_per_worker=0) run_config = tf.estimator.RunConfig( experimental_distribute=tf.contrib.distribute.DistributeConfig( train_distribute=distribution_strategy, remote_cluster={"worker": ["192.168.20.50:1111", "192.168.20.52:1112"]}), session_config=session_config, save_checkpoints_secs=60*60*24, )
And run the real resnet model:
python3 cifar10_main.py --data_dir=${PWD}/cifar_data
But I encounter this assertion failure:

		The error message points out that you need to have two replicas to make CollectiveAllReduceStrategy to work. Either at least 2 GPUs on a single machine or multiple machines.
For distributed training, please use tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate API.
Closing this issue, feel free to re-open it.

My scnario is that we use CPU only to do the distributed training. So I pass num_gpus_per_worker=0 to CollectiveAllReduceStrategy. Do you mean currently CollectiveAllReduceStrategy doesn't support CPU only distributed training?

		If you use cpu only, you have to have at least two machines.

		Try not touch num_gpus_per_worker, i.e. leave it as it’s default, and try again.
I tried myself a couple of months ago and it did work with CPU only TF. Let me know if your case does not.

 Yes, I did do the distributed training on two machine with CPU only. (192.168.20.50, 192.168.20.52)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/byronyi&gt;@byronyi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I tried to leave num_gpus_per_worker as default. (=2) But the error is still the same.
Following is what I found after I debug the code:
In standalone client mode, CollectiveAllReduceExtended will use default init function _initialize_local_worker in which it will set num_workers to 1.
`
def _initialize_local_worker(self, num_gpus_per_worker):
"""Initializes the object for local training."""
self._is_chief = True

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if num_gpus_per_worker:
  local_devices = tuple(
      "/device:GPU:%d" % i for i in range(num_gpus_per_worker)
  )
else:
  local_devices = ("/device:CPU:0",)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

`
Thus its CollectiveAllReduce.num_workers is set to 1 too. That's why I got the error. "ValueError: num_workers * len(input_tensors) must be 2 or greater".
So does that mean standalone client mode is not suitable for multi machine distributed training?
I will modify code to use tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate so that I can use the independent worker mode.
Background: I am a developer from Intel tensorflow team focusing upon multi-node. Currently, we are using horovod as allreduce solution. But it's said that distributed strategy will be a trend in tensorflow for allreduce solution. So I am evaluating the impact of distributed strategy. Any comments and helps are highly appreciated!

		By the way, I could not find a way to get rid of the following warning:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING:tensorflow:It seems that global step (tf.train.get_global_step) has not been increased. Current value (could be stable): 0 vs previous value: 0. You could increase the global step by passing tf.train.get_global_step() to Optimizer.apply_gradients or Optimizer.minimize.

 might be something wrong with the model. I didn't see it with ResNet50. I'll re-run examples to reproduce this warning later.

 Thank you for your enlightening script. I tried it both on our company's cluster and my private machine.  On our cluster the worker script got hang and in my private machine (a cleaner environment), the worker script got error. I have pasted the log in &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/ca1b55e5a5423d5b3abb9efc6fd34b80&gt;https://gist.github.com/ca1b55e5a5423d5b3abb9efc6fd34b80&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I have no idea why you met 'https' scheme not supported in proxy URI problem. I never saw that before.
Could you replace localhost with 127.0.0.1? Also running in an TF docker might help.

  I set it as 127.0.0.1, but it's the same.
I found that it's caused by invalid setting of https_proxy. After I set https_proxy as the correct one, my private desktop got hang too as my clusters. Anyway, I think it's related with grpc's https_proxy, do you know how to disable https_proxy run-time for grpc?  Also, I am confused that even within single machine (localhost), the tf server needs https_proxy.

  I can run the distributed training successfully(CollectiveAllReduceStrategy) on my local machine. But it's still failed in our company cluster. (same set of software) Our clusters's is managed by slurm. Does it conflicts with gRPC? Is there any pre-cautions for using gRPC from network perspective?
