	<summary>Input pipe line with consuming CSV data (dictionary object) does not implement Batch</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 20.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): latest from source
TensorFlow version (use command below): latest from source
Python version: 3.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 3.6.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: 2070

Describe the current behavior
https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data#consuming_csv_data
titanic_slices = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(dict(df))
That code will have dictionary object slice.
element_spec returns {dict:XX} This throws exception if we use Batch from the same documentation,
def make_window_dataset(ds, window_size=5, shift=1, stride=1):
windows = ds.window(window_size, shift=shift, stride=stride)
def sub_to_batch(sub):
return sub.batch(window_size, drop_remainder=True)
windows = windows.flat_map(sub_to_batch)
return windows

Please confirm this issue is faced on windows, as we see you have mentioned linux and the code says windows.
