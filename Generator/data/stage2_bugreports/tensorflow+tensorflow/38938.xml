While using model.fit or model.fit_generator the sub iterations in epoch shows unknown number of iterations which is goes on despite surpassing the batch size.
Describe the expected behavior
While using model.fit or model.fit_generator the sub iterations in epoch must be definite.

		I checked the colab notebook and was able to reproduce the issue. For now, you may use tf -2.1 which does not contain this issue.

This was also resolved in TF nightly version(). Please check the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/86d88c05a705c79b7ee1df625ef7ccad/untitled44.ipynb&gt;here.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
