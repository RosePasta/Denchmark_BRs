	<summary>XLA bug w/ Keras: "Node name contains invalid characters"</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0+nv
Python version: 3.6.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: RTX 2080 Ti, NVIDIA Driver 418.43

Describe the current behavior
Shows the warning at the predict time:
2019-09-27 11:02:42.377419: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/process_function_library_runtime.cc:667] Ignoring multi-device function optimization failure: Invalid argument: Node '_arg_segments_ids_input_0_1_0_arg': Node name contains invalid characters
And doesn't enable XLA optimizations as I can see (performance doesn't improve)
Describe the expected behavior
There should be no problem at all.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Occured in a real-case keras-bert based code, but reproduces in the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.backend import set_session
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, Add
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.graph_options.optimizer_options.global_jit_level = tf.OptimizerOptions.ON_1
set_session(tf.Session(config=config))

seq_len = 80
batch_size=5000

tokens_ids_input = Input(shape=(seq_len, ), dtype='int32', name='tokens_ids_input')
segments_ids_input = Input(shape=(seq_len, ), dtype='int32', name='segments_ids_input')

output = Add()([Embedding(input_dim=5000, output_dim=16)(tokens_ids_input), Embedding(input_dim=2, output_dim=16)(segments_ids_input)])

model = Model(inputs=[tokens_ids_input, segments_ids_input], outputs=[output])

model.predict([np.zeros((batch_size, seq_len)), np.zeros((batch_size, seq_len))])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

, I executed on Colab with Tf 1.14.0. But it didn't throw any error. Please take a look at &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/gadagashwini/57dd2eae878e43da89dbc146409c59a5/untitled169.ipynb&gt;colab gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and confirm the expected behavior. Thanks!

		I'm able to reproduce the bug in the "tensorflow/tensorflow:1.14.0-gpu-py3" docker container. Google Colab has K80 GPU while I have RTX 2080 Ti, so I think this bug could be related to the 2080 GPUs and/or CUDA 10.1 only.

, Can you try with with CUDA 10.0. And,  Let us know if issue still persists. Thanks!

		That reproduces both with CUDA 10.1 and 10.0 (as in tensorflow/tensorflow:1.14.0-gpu-py3 image)
UPD: But "CUDA driver API" version is 10.1 in both cases (as it's the host's version and I'm running the code in docker containers)

 Can you try recently released  and let us know whether the issuer persists there? Thanks!

		The (mostly) same error in tensorflow/tensorflow:1.15.0rc2-gpu-py3:
2019-10-04 10:25:57.285825: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/process_function_library_runtime.cc:688] Ignoring multi-device function optimization failure: Invalid argument: Node '_arg_tokens_ids_input_0_0_0_arg': Node name contains invalid characters
The difference is that previously the problem was with "_arg_segments_ids_input_0_1_0_arg" node name and now with the "_arg_tokens_ids_input_0_0_0_arg". This error occurs because node names can't start with underscore, but for some reason in these cases they do.

		I don't think the log you're seeing signifies a hard error since it is a .  But CC &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/iganichev&gt;@iganichev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 who added the warning line.
As for why XLA does not provide a speedup, have you confirmed that XLA is kicking in?  You should see a Compiled cluster using XLA! log if it is kicking in.
Note that speedups using XLA is expected but not guaranteed.

		That error is indeed non-fatal. It is warning that some optimizations could not be performed.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sanjoy&gt;@sanjoy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 maybe some Keras folks can take a look at who produces these badly named nodes.

		<comment id='9' author='nikitos9000' date='2019-10-08T14:17:49Z'>
		Yes, you're right, I can't really tell if it disables all optimizations made or only a part of them due to this error.

		I can confirm that there is a considerable speed difference between networks where this warning shows up and networks where it doesn't. I can also see from profiling that the former case splits the network into multiple XLA clusters and the latter turns it into a single cluster. I'm still trying to find which difference causes the ghost underscore node to show up. It is not in the graph_def!

		I am seeing this issue on one of my models:

2020-05-12 18:32:58.336604: W tensorflow/core/common_runtime/process_function_library_runtime.cc:688] Ignoring multi-device function optimization failure: Invalid argument: Node '_arg_foo_input_bar_0_4_0_arg': Node name contains invalid characters

The model was created with TF Estimator on TF 1.15 w/ Feature Columns and Keras Layers.  The model is not compiled to TensorRT.  The model is being served with Nvidia's Triton with XLA enabled.

		I'm still seeing the issue as well. I'm not sure if it is causing any
performance issues, though.

		I'm not sure as well. From what &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmaniry&gt;@dmaniry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said there is.
Also there is the initial delay on the first inference this error appears. for me it was of about 40 seconds

		I have got the same issue, both on GTX 2080ti and V100s. Does anyone have a solution?
