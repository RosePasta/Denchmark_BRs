	<summary>Problem with documentation tutorial</summary>
	<description>
Hello tf team. I was trying the embedding tutorial as mentioned on the tf docs webpage.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word_embeddings&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The below two lines do give me error while I am following the same documentation as mentioned in the webpage.
train_batches = train_data.shuffle(1000).padded_batch(10)
test_batches = test_data.shuffle(1000).padded_batch(10)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47158509/77058288-3e3b4180-69fb-11ea-932a-df913d43c385.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have manually tried to fix the error by putting padded_shapes as [None] or [None, None] but both of them have thrown error.

The same does not work in RNN tutorial as well. The API change of padded shape seems to have broken both the tutorials.

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/khimraj&gt;@khimraj&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Seems to be working fine.
I think they need this as edit in documentation

		Maybe we can issue a pull request to fix this up. This  exists in two of the tutorials üòÑ

Any explanation why the  padded shape = ([None], []) is the parameter.

Please fix in https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_classification_rnn as well. Just the simple change should. @khimraj

I get the problem. In tf v2.1 API the argument was mandatory https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#padded_batch


Whereas in tf v 2.2rc API it is optional. https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.2/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#padded_batch This seems to confuse on the documentation page. The tutorial should mention this point. Then it would be clear.


Displaying the tensorflow version using print(tensorflow.__version__) in tutorial and above comment can make this stuff clear.

   that commit of mine (e449e964532654e11dc25ebe75d3e89c05266d51) clarifies this in all the tutorials that use . This should be published to tensorflow.org within 24h.
Thanks for reporting.
