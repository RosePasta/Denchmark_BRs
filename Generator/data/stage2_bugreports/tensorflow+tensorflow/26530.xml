Much like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25802&gt;#25802&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, documentation for tf.math.argmax is created from a generated file ; a link to the file that generates  would be handy for users.
Related files to be updated: tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api/api_def_ArgMax.pbtxt, /tensorflow/core/ops/math_ops.cc

 Can you create single issue with all the similar modifications? It is too much overhead to work on 8 similar issues and it will be better for everyone (including you). Could you combine rest of the seven similar issues into one issue? Thanks!

 Yes sure,my understanding was to create individual issues so that new GSoC students could easily pick them up as their first task .
Will combine them into a single issue by tomorrow!

 Can I take reference from &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html?highlight=argmax#numpy.argmax&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for adding examples just like it is mentioned in this Issue - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25802&gt;#25802&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Closing this in favor of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26532&gt;#26532&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as work has been done on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/26540&gt;#26540&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for both this and that
