	<summary>0.7.0 pip packages are not named properly (error: is not a supported wheel on this platform).  [Will be fixed in next binary release]</summary>
	<description>
My os is ubuntu 14.04
My python version is 2.7.6
Following the instructions for installing with pip I am getting this error:

$ sudo pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.7.0-py2-none-linux_x86_64.whl
tensorflow-0.7.0-py2-none-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
Storing debug log for failure in /home/terence/.pip/pip.log

It works fine installing older releases of tensorflow with pip but not this one.

		I had the same issues while trying to install tensor flow 0.70 GPU for python3 (pip3). For whatever reason, it was just the FILENAME which was wrong. It has to be in a special format to be legal. You can check yourself by following the instructions &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28107123/cannot-install-numpy-from-wheel-format&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which tupels of tags are legal for your machine. In my case the command
"sudo pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow-0.7.0-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl"
produced the exact error message you got above. However, when i downloaded the file myself and renamed it to "tensorflow-0.7.0-cp34-none-linux_x86_64.whl", then executed the command again with changed filename, it worked =)
Edit : OS = Ubuntu 15.10, Python = 3.4.3

 do you have 64 bit ubuntu or 32? (run )
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HellMood&gt;@HellMood&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for a workaround. I have to try it myself. We have intentionally used this name so that people with py35 don't have to rename it. It installs fine on 14.04 with py3 but we have not tried 15.10 yet.

		<comment id='28' author='terrybroad' date='2016-03-22T19:34:55Z'>
		We do support python 3.3 and 3.5 in that TensorFlow does work with them when compiled from sources.
However, since I suspect you mean provide pre-built pip wheels for 3.3 and 3.5 -- that is indeed what we would like to do, but we have not gotten around to yet.

Would be greatly appreciated if you could do this, I need to test a project which uses TensorFlow on Travis CI and don't want to have to build TensorFlow for each Python version every time I test.

		I have Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit and wanted to install tensorflow-0.7.1-cp34-none-linux_x86_64.whl and had the same error. This is what woked for me:

sudo pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp34-none-linux_x86_64.whl

You have to call a tensorflow python script like so:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#call it with python3.4
python3.4 tensorflow_demo.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 yes, that does not work. Python 3.5 will be part of net release. In the meanwhile you can try nightly build - &lt;denchmark-link:http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-python35-linux-cpu/&gt;http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-python35-linux-cpu/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I had the same problem with 0.8.0 with both python2 and python3 installed. Didn't work even after renaming the wheel file. My problem was that 'pip' was pointing to the python3 installation instead of python2. Either using 'pip2' or properly linking 'pip' to the default python interpreter (python2 in my case) fixed the issue.
To make sure the right pip version is used:
pip --version
pip 8.1.2 from /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
