	<summary>Strided slice op CHECK failure</summary>
	<description>
Two reports of a CHECK failure in the strided slice op have surfaced on Stack Overflow:

Tensorflow print value of a tensor
Tensorflow evaluate: Aborted (core dumped)

In both cases, the error message is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;F tensorflow/core/kernels/strided_slice_op.cc:316] Check failed: tmp.CopyFrom(input.Slice(begin[0], end[0]), final_shape) 
Aborted (core dumped)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

...which appears to match the  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d9c173fc7adf9443d58310dd08a84b9eb89d4c8f/tensorflow/core/kernels/strided_slice_op.cc#L90&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
It looks like both questions might be using the same model code, so I'll ask the questioner to post additional details if possible.

		I believe this bug has already been fixed (at least a month and a half ago). Did they specify what verison of TensorFlow they are using and if they tried it with the latest RC?

		Hi, I have encountered this issue on TF 0.10 release on my macbook pro (all of a sudden, I wonder what has changed, it has been fine all along.). It's MacOS Sierra 10.12.1.
and TF release 0.10 is encountering this issue, and changing it to 0.11 has already fixed the issue.

		Sounds like this has been fixed. Please reopen if this is still an issue in the latest release.
