	<summary>TypeError: 'InputLayer' object is not iterable</summary>

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS Catalina 10.15.6
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): using pip3 install
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.3.0-54-gfcc4b966f1 2.3.1
Python version: 3.8

Describe the current behavior
When I try to convert tensorflow model to CoreML model using coremltools I get this error: TypeError: 'InputLayer' object is not iterable
Describe the expected behavior
Tensorflow model should convert to CoreML model without any errors.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
model.save(modelFolder)
coreMLModel = convert(modelFolder, input_names = ['input'], output_names = ['output'])
coreMLModel.save(folderManager.modelsFolder)
