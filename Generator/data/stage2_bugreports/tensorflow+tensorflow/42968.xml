	<summary>Large number is multiplied with the embedding output</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The url with the issue is &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/transformer&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/transformer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

While, I was checking the transformers code from this &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/transformer&gt;tensorflow documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, in the  subsection under  section, I found that before adding positional encoding, square root of  is multiplied with the embedding output. I doubt what is the specific reason behind multiplying the embedding output with a large number. Attaching the screenshot of the specific code snippet from the link.

 tries to address the very same question.
Perhaps you can engage with the community there to know more. Thanks!
