System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
I want to change the
D.object_for_each_prior-&gt; tf.Tensor([0 0 0 ... 0 0 0], shape=(8732,), dtype=int64) want to change the position 8700 and 8701 to the 1 value
since the assign value is no longer available how should I assign spicific value to the specific location?

		Perhaps you can use &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Variable?version=nightly#assign&gt;assign&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 method from .
For example;
v = tf.Variable(1.)
print(v)
v.assign(2.)
print(v)
#Output 
&lt;tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=1.0&gt;
&lt;tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0&gt;
