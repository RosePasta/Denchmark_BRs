	<summary>Update Cmake minimum requirement to v3.5</summary>
	<description>
As it seems to have appeared an &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/17#issuecomment-258649999&gt;issue with Cmake 3.3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and the minimum known working Cmake version apparently is 3.5 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5071#issuecomment-255490169&gt;(see here)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Should the minimum requirement be updated on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/CMakeLists.txt#L2&gt;CmakeLists&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to 3.5 and the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/README.md#pre-requisites&gt;readme&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for minimum 3.5 up to 3.6?
If those changes look relevant and are the ones to be made I could update them and submit a PR.
