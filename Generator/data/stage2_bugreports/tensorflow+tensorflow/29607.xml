	<summary>How do I extract information (consistently) such as Accuracy etc,.. from the distributed example/context ?</summary>
	<description>
I was using your distribute example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/training_loops&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/training_loops&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I wanted to know how to properly extract some properties such as accuracy in this custom training loop example.
I have tried a couple of things but the documentation regarding this is not too specific.
Something I was initially looking at was:

passing in or returning a tf.Keras.metrics object, taking the logits and labels within the step_fn and getting predictions and then accuracy. But I am running into issues of tensor parsing. Should I be using tf.Summary.scalar in some way then?

A concrete reply would help.

		This question is better asked on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged//tensorflow&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it is not a bug or feature request. There is also a larger community that reads questions there and can provide better help to such issues. Thanks!
