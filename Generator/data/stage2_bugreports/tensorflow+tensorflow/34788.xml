Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): NO
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0
Python version: 3.6.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.2
GPU model and memory: 11G

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
When I set device to gpu, the code runs correctly. When I set device to cpu, the code raises error: tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: indices[4] = [4, -1] does not index into param shape [5,1] [Op:GatherNd].
Describe the expected behavior
Consistent results on cpu and gpu.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(2222222)

with tf.device('cpu:0'):
  a = np.random.rand(5, 1)
  print(a)

  b = tf.gather_nd(
      a,
      [[0, -1], [1, -1], [2, -1], [3, -1], [4, -1]])

  print(b.numpy())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

		This is a known issue in TF we cannot change without breaking backward compatibility; gather with invalid indices fails on the CPU but does not on the GPU :-/
