	<summary>The FixedLenFeature of parse_example?</summary>
	<description>
View&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/parse_example&gt; API DOC&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The description maybe wrong?
Each FixedLenFeature df maps to a Tensor of the specified type (or tf.float32 if not specified) and shape (serialized.size(),) + df.shape.
But the example shows:
For dense results in two serialized Examples:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[
  features {
    feature { key: "age" value { int64_list { value: [ 0 ] } } }
    feature { key: "gender" value { bytes_list { value: [ "f" ] } } }
   },
   features {
    feature { key: "age" value { int64_list { value: [] } } }
    feature { key: "gender" value { bytes_list { value: [ "f" ] } } }
  }
]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We can use arguments:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;example_names: ["input0", "input1"],
features: {
    "age": FixedLenFeature([], dtype=tf.int64, default_value=-1),
    "gender": FixedLenFeature([], dtype=tf.string),
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the expected output is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
{
  "age": [[0], [-1]],
  "gender": [["f"], ["f"]],
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The shape of output is (2, 1) not equal to (2, ) + (), where  (2,) is (serialized.size(),) and () is df.shape.

		A member of the TensorFlow organization has replied after the stat:awaiting tensorflower label was applied.
