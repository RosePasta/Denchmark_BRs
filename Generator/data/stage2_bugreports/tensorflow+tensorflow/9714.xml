		It's a SEGV, which looks like numpy. Could you answer the following:

What tensorflow version are you using? Which OS?
Can you build from source with debug symbols and try again?
Were you loading ops or using something in tf.contrib?
Any small repro?

		I'm using tensorflow 1.1.0 and my OS is Ubuntu 14.04
I couldn't build from the source. However, I uninstalled tensorflow and pip installed again. Everything seems to be working now.

		OK, please reopen if it happens again and you have a way to repro.
