	<summary>Feedback limitation in a documentation web page</summary>
	<description>
Hello tf developers team.
I'm coming to this page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/bitwise&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/bitwise&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and I see no indication whether this is implemented on GPU or CPU only. Will tf help me for my project or not? I find this information page extremely unhelpful for my purpose. As the overview should state clearly when to use the library and when not (I need only bitwise operations).
I left a feedback on your page giving two stars - but I can't write a string for you. How would you know what to fix if everyone are just saying the document is bad, and can't explain why and what they're missing?

		Thanks for the feedback ... it seems you found the place to enter it :)
I would suggest starting with the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/overview&gt;guides and tutorials&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to get started. Perhaps check out the beginner eager tutorial notebooks to look at GPU placement. Colab provides a option to toggle the between CPU and GPU (and TPU!). The API reference is a mixed bag since there are about ~5000 pages of them. But the docstrings are open source so contributions welcome.
Stars are used more for a signal. There are no plans to add a more featureful feedback widget.
