In order to expedite the trouble-shooting process, could you please provide the TensorFlow version, the complete code to reproduce the issue and the dataset you are using.
Also if you're using a GPU, try limiting GPU memory growth as per &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu#limiting_gpu_memory_growth&gt;this guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and let us know if it helps.
