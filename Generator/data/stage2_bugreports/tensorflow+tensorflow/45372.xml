	<summary>TextVectorization layer together with TensorBoard fails when trying to log the weights</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 Version 2004 &amp; Windows 10 Pro Version 20H2
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): PyPi
TensorFlow version (use command below):  v2.3.1 &amp; v2.4.0-rc3 &amp; 2.5.0-dev20201203
Python version: 3.6.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1.243
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (notebook) &amp; GeForce GTX 980 Ti

Describe the current behavior
When trying to use TensorBoard with a model, which has a TextVectorization layer, the log_weights function in callbacks.py of tensorflow/python/keras runs into an exception when it tries to get the name of the layer where the weights reside - which I guess might be because the TextVectorization layer is still experimental, and as such this might be why.
Describe the expected behavior
Either the weights would have a name, or they would be skipped when TensorBoard tries to log them.

I've made an example showing the issue using Google Colab, and it can be accessed through this link: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wRbFp-O6txoUv01GA_thlwJu_VxkPeyX&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wRbFp-O6txoUv01GA_thlwJu_VxkPeyX&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


For now I've added a few lines of code to TensorFlow locally, to just skip the layer if it's a TextVectorization layer - I don't know much about the internals of the layer, so I'm pretty much just shooting blindly there.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15278940/101026115-c906a100-3576-11eb-9f76-e97e19db43cf.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Traceback at the exception:

,
Looking at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41244#issuecomment-730210764&gt;this comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from a similar issue, I was able to run the code without any issues. Please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/bb9bafc3228d94eccd5d235e41a46e8d/45372.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

Yup, that seems to be related to the same problem!
Guessing this issue can be closed now then, since it has been referenced in the other issue, thanks!
