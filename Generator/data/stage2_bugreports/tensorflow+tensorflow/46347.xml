	<summary>layering check mismatch between internal and open-source TFLM bazel builds</summary>

The Google-internal bazel builds have layering checks turned on while the open-source builds do not. This results in PRs passing external checks but then failing internally (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/46242&gt;#46242&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as an example).
If we can have the same behavior in the OSS bazel build then there will be one less discrepancy between the internal and open-source builds.
