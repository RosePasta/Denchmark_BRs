Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):windows10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):2.4.0
Python version:3.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:11.0

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
Can not reshapes SparseTensor
Describe the expected behavior
Reshapes a SparseTensor
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf

sp = tf.SparseTensor([[1,1],[2,2]],[1.,2.],[4,4])
new_sp = tf.sparse.reshape(sp,[8,-1])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Program Files\Python37\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\ops\sparse_ops.py", line 902, in sparse_reshape
and sp_input.shape.is_fully_defined()):
AttributeError: 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor' object has no attribute 'is_fully_defined'

I have tried in colab with TF-GPU version 2.4 and i am not seeing any issue. Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/9262e45d524185a9efa89847f4aae52b/untitled586.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

		Sorry, I found this problem was caused by myself. I used "pickle" to load a SparseTensor, which caused the init function not be executed, so the correct SparseTensor._dense_shape_default was not obtained.
