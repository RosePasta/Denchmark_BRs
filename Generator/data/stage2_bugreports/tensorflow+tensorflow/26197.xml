	<summary>[TF 2.0 API Docs] tf.keras</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a documentation issue. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:doc_template
System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras

Describe the documentation issue

"Defined in python/keras/api/_v2/keras/.py" is pointing to a broken link:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/api/_v2/keras/__init__.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/api/_v2/keras/__init__.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Currently it has "Detailed documentation and user guides are available at keras.io."
It would be better to point users to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, otherwise the experience feels broken.
It would be great to list some key differences between tf.keras vs Keras as an independent project (keras.io). Or at least point out there is no 1:1 mapping and what each one has and the other one doesn't have. This has been discussed in blog posts and forums but the official documentation should at least have a high level overview with a few sentences.
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
Yes

 I read some other issues and found that .bzl and .py files are used for generating modules but I am not sure if these are the files we need to change. Can you please help .

  I wanted to give a shot at documenting the difference between tf.keras and keras.io .Can you point me to good resources (blogs etc.) which I can use for the proper documentation. What word count and line count are we looking at?

		Both the things were fixed: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/33443&gt;#33443&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Regarding difference between keras.io vs tensorflow.org/keras, contributions welcome :)

		There are a few things here:

Broken link on page: I no longer see any broken links. So we are good on this.
My comment on "Detailed documentation and user guides are available at keras.io". It is still pointed to keras.io. I thought keras.io is no longer really an active project any more. Why are we still point docs there?
Thanks all for volunteering to document the different between tf.keras and keras.io. Not sure if there is any point in doing so though. Keras.io is no longer having any new releases and tf.keras will be moved into the original Keras repo. So there is really just tf.Keras.
