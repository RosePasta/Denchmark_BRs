System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.15.4
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:  N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A

Describe the current behavior
I am working on distributed learning in tensorflow through estimators API using below simple code template:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# TrainSpec for training
    train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(
        input_fn=lambda: csv_input_fn(TRAIN_PATH, FLAGS.batch_size, True),
        max_steps=FLAGS.train_steps,
        hooks=[])
    # EvalSpec for test
    eval_spec = tf.estimator.EvalSpec(
        input_fn=lambda: csv_input_fn(TEST_PATH, FLAGS.batch_size, True))
    print("---training and testing---")
    tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(classifier, train_spec, eval_spec)
    print("---training finished---")

    # All role are workers, pick the task_index with 0 to save model
    if FLAGS.task_index == 0:
        classifier.export_saved_model(export_dir, serving_input_receiver_fn)
        # classifier.export_savedmodel(export_dir, serving_input_receiver_fn, strip_default_attrs=True)
    print("finish...")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I encountered the following error during training.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow_core/python/training/server_lib.py", line 158, in __del__
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'UnimplementedError'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I analyzed the source code and found that the errors object may be garbage collected.
I will submit a PR later, please pass it. Because I will use v1.15.4(v1.15.4 version on our production environment)
for distributed training on kubeflow,
I donâ€™t want to modify the code there every time.
Thanks!!!

,
TensorFlow 1.x is not actively supported. Could you please update TensorFlow to v2.4 and check if you are facing the same issue? Thanks!

Modify the source code to solve the problem by myself. You could try it, too.
