	<summary>Segfault reading dataset more than once (`make_batched_features_dataset`)</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.14 Mojave
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: NA
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary / pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.11.0-rc2-4-gc19e29306c', '1.11.0')
Python version: 2.7.10
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA

&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/brianmartin/2b43dca69453478ed33b49f1029e03fe&gt;Gist of full output of `./tools/tf_env_collect.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Exact command to reproduce:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brianmartin/4f221eb838dce8099342f829fb13253d/raw/00c2a1736b9a292f8a6fb88164d240a766468744/gistfile1.txt
$ python gistfile1.txt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the current behavior
Current behavior in 1.11.0, 1.12.0rcX is that the included script segfaults (11: SIGSEGV).
Describe the expected behavior
Expected behavior is no segfault. Version 1.10.1, 1.10.0, and 1.9.0 do not segfault. I have not checked lower versions.
Code to reproduce the issue
See a full script which reproduces this issue along two different code paths here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/brianmartin/4f221eb838dce8099342f829fb13253d&gt;https://gist.github.com/brianmartin/4f221eb838dce8099342f829fb13253d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The segfault occurs when reading the dataset a second time. The first read works as expected.
For reference the two code samples which produce datasets which cause a segfault on second read are:
    dataset = make_batched_features_dataset(file_pattern=data_file,
                                            batch_size=1,
                                            features=feature_spec)
I've also dug into make_batched_features_dataset and minified down to this repro:
    from tensorflow.contrib.data.python.ops import parsing_ops
    from tensorflow.python.data.ops import readers

    dataset = Dataset.from_tensor_slices([data_file]) \
                     .interleave(readers.TFRecordDataset, cycle_length=1) \
                     .batch(batch_size=1) \
                     .apply(parsing_ops.parse_example_dataset(feature_spec))
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide or help with! This is blocking us from upgrading to the latest Tensorflow version in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/spotify/spotify-tensorflow&gt;spotify/spotify-tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I've dug in a bit more. For a FixedLenFeature, this test case still succeeds on the first read and fails on the second read -- no change there. But it fails with an exception rather than the segfault we see with VarLenFeature.
I've updated the gist to reproduce in tensorflow&gt;=1.11.0 here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/brianmartin/4f221eb838dce8099342f829fb13253d&gt;https://gist.github.com/brianmartin/4f221eb838dce8099342f829fb13253d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The exception on the second, failing read (after seeing the first read succeed):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Attempting first read..

 Thank you very much for narrowing down the bug, we have fixed it and are going to submit it soon, will update you when that is done.
