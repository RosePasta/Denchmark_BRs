	<summary>[TF 2.0 API Docs] tf.keras.Model</summary>
	<description>
System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0 alpha
Doc Link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py

Describe the documentation issue
- Links:
A link to  would be appreciated for those who are new to  and TensorFlow 1.x and 2.0 - &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. E.g. See this Keras Model class API doc: &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/models/model/#model-class-api&gt;https://keras.io/models/model/#model-class-api&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
- Description:
Taking into account this is a 'heavy' module it may not be easy to write good docs for tf.keras.Model. Since tf.keras is a crucial API to TF 2.0, so let's make the docs a delight to read. The current documentation for tf.keras.Model is a bit incomprehensible for a novice or experienced user.
In terms of user experience for someone who is new or not new to TF, maybe the description should be improved and follow the keras.io docs more closely. For instance, arguments under  were apparently copy-pasted from  docs (&lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/models/model/&gt;https://keras.io/models/model/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). However, you have to scroll all the way down to see them here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#compile&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#compile&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ().
The description at keras.io is neater and more organized imo. It starts with a short description and jumps to args from compile. I'd suggest we follow the same structure.
Also, as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/models/model/&gt;https://keras.io/models/model/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we should include a link to the guide to  - &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - which is quite well written.
- Examples:
Not enough examples - they are mentioned here and there. See UX issues above under Description. Recommend to rewrite it to follow the original  module - &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/models/model/#model-class-api&gt;https://keras.io/models/model/#model-class-api&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - along with examples.
- Parameters, Returns, Raises:
UX issues - see Description above.
- Visuals:
Recommend to add visuals from &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/keras/functional&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
Yes, let's make tf.keras docs awesome.

		It's a known issue. This is the original: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. But the  URL is broken - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/api/_v2/keras/__init__.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/api/_v2/keras/__init__.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 lands you on a 404. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/margaretmz&gt;@margaretmz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has raised it here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26197&gt;#26197&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


@8bitmp3 I searched out into the docs repository but did'nt the file for tf.keras documentation can be please help me in finding the appropriate files.

 I found out that the API docs will be generated with the help of api_generator we have to create a build_doc API with the help of api_generator API to create docs! but I didn't get how this would be done!

		Is this issue still valid?
We now automatically links in the 2.0 ref docs to places it's used in the guide and tutorials. See the second section here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
