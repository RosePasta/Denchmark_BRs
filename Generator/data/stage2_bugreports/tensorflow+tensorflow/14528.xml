	<summary>Tensorflow would sometimes get rather slow during training</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4
Python version: 3.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 8.0 / cuDNN 6.0
GPU model and memory: GTX1060 6GB

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I train my network, at first it works properly, however sometimes it gets rather slower (about 10 times slower than normal speed, shown below). When I type nvidia-smi to check the GPU state, I find the GPU-Util is rather low (2-3%)
The normal speed is about 1 minute per 100 steps while it would sometimes cost 10 minminutes per 100 steps.
I used to use Tensorflow v1.1 and did not find this problem. However I updated Tensorflow to v1.4 several days ago and this problem occurred.

		Its a little challenging to debug without seeing the model code you're running. Could you please share that and then might be able to help you better.

 The model I run is Inception_v1 provided here &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/inception_v1.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The code is like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        with tf.name_scope('input'):
		tra_image_batch, tra_label_batch = input_data3.getbatch(BATCH_SIZE, 'inception_v1',
			224, True, 0)
		val_image_batch, val_label_batch = input_data3.getbatch(test_batchsize, 'inception_v1',
			224, False, 0)
	x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, IMG_W, IMG_H, 3])
	y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])
	is_training = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, shape=[])
	with slim.arg_scope(inception_v1.inception_v1_arg_scope()):
		logits, end_points = inception_v1.inception_v1(x, 1001, is_training=is_training)
	loss = tools.loss(logits, y_)
	accuracy = tools.accuracy(logits, y_)
	top5_accuracy = tools.top5_accuracy(logits, y_)
        train_op = tools.optimize_m(loss, learning_rate1, learning_rate2, my_global_step)
	try:
                for step in np.arange(MAX_STEP):
			if coord.should_stop():
					break
			tra_images,tra_labels = sess.run([tra_image_batch, tra_label_batch])
			_, tra_loss, tra_acc = sess.run([train_op, loss, accuracy], feed_dict={x:tra_images, y_:tra_labels, is_training:True})
			if step % 100 == 0 or step == MAX_STEP:
				nowtime = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", time.localtime())
				print (nowtime+'  Step: %d, loss: %.4f, accuracy: %.4f%%' %(step+global_step, tra_loss, tra_acc))

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Is that something we know about? Any way to debug?

		To close this and likely not with a great end.  I wrote this script a long time ago and it watches nvidia-smi for any type of GPU slow down.  I doubt that is the issue, but it was my issue yesterday and I was reminded about this ticket.  All it does is run NVIDIA-SMI, grep for a very basic Hardware slowdown as well as keep a log of each full nvidia-smi result.
