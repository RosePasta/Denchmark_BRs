&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autograph&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autograph&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

"Autograph capabilities and limitations." link points an out dated doc at:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/autograph/LIMITATIONS.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/autograph/LIMITATIONS.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


There was a similar bug in #22280 in 2018.
This issue was reported in the closed bug) but this comment did not get a reply. Thus, I'm filing a new bug.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Actually, this issue was fixed on Aug 6th, 1.5+ month ago.

		It seems like the link was fixed on Aug 6th, 1.5+ month ago, on GitHub.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/commit/c29c6fa8202fcd8da4ab8d8072c5f7dacf7c160a#diff-039832f2dbb662a37df6e0fa64ebe35e&gt;tensorflow/docs@c29c6fa#diff-039832f2dbb662a37df6e0fa64ebe35e&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm wondering why the live document is not fixed yet.
Isn't r2.0rc branch the version we use to create the site? Or we haven't pushed any document fixes at least since Aug 6th?

 TF team is working on updating the website for future 2.0 release. Once, TF2.0 is released, all the links will work as expected. Thanks!
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/autograph/g3doc/reference/limitations.md&gt;Here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the missing link.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0rc/site/en/guide/autograph.ipynb&gt;This autograph.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has correct links. Thanks!

		Do you mean we won't fix problems of exiting docs until tf2 is launched?

 As you mentioned and I also checked source doc which was fixed already. But, TF team is working on updating the TF website. It will take some time to update all the links. Thanks!

		I see. I'm not very happy about the fact that the website is frozen for months. But I understand the current status. Thank you for the advice, Vishnuvardhan.
BTW, when TF2 will be released? &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/roadmap&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/roadmap&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says .
Anyway, I'm closing this bug because there is no solution until TF2 is launched.
