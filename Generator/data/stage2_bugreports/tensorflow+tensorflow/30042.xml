	<summary>Installation documentation and mac wheels</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are no binary wheels for tensorflow 1.14 for mac (should be &lt;denchmark-link:https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.14.0-py3-none-any.whl&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and the documentation page still points to 1.13.
Is 1.14 still considered unstable? Was the wheel generation and documentation update simply forgotten? Or is it normal that it takes a couple of days after the release?

		Any update on when the wheels will appear on the googleapis storage? They exist on pypi?

		Seems there was a bug in the release process pipeline.
We'll (try to) solve this issue this week, sorry about this.

		Added &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/av8ramit&gt;@av8ramit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 too. I wonder if there's a desync between our upload scripts.

		It appears the 1.14 build upload was not completed. Can you try again now please?

		Yes, the downloads work now! The &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip&gt;documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 still points to 1.13 though.

		I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can fix the documentation link, assigning to him
