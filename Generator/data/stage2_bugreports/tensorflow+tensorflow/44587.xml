	<summary>Behaviour of ImageDataGenerator with subset='validation'</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator#flow&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator#flow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The documentation for keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator doesn't specify how it handles validation data.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In particular, documentation for the .flow() method doesn't specify whether transformations are applied to augment validation data, when validation_split has been given in the constructor and subset='validation' is passed.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Usage example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are no usage examples that use the parameter validation_split with a previously undivided dataset. All examples employ a dataset that is already divided in training/validation and then create two ImageDataGenerator objects with different parameters.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Other&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have read the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.3.1/tensorflow/python/keras/preprocessing/image.py#L808&gt;source code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in order to understand this behaviour. However, I end up in the definition of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/preprocessing/image.py#L400&gt;NumpyArrayIterator&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, a class that apparently inherits from itself, and I haven't been able to find its actual implementation or the meaning of this strange inheritance.

		It seems that  actually inherits from the implementation in the  module, which is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/preprocessing/image.py#L24&gt;imported&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in this implementation.
From what I've seen in that package's source code, I'd think that it doesn't distinguish between training and validation subsets, and applies transformations to both.
