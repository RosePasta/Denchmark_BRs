	<summary>why use "x_is_dict" to check y?</summary>
	<description>
In tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn/learn_io/data_feeder.py
On L325:
self._y = None if y is None else \ dict([(k, check_array(v, v.dtype)) for k, v in list(y.items())]) if x_is_dict else check_array(y, y.dtype) 
I happened to have a implementation where x is a dict but y is a numpy array, so I got an error. I wonder why we do not use y_is_dict here?

		This question is better asked on  &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it is not a  bug or feature request. There is also a larger community that reads questions there. Thanks!

		Ok thanks. I do think it is a bug though. A wrong variable is used here.

 looks like the same problem, with a little more context about the x/y confusion.
