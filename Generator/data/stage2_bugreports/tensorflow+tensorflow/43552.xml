	<summary>'Operation' object has no attribute '_unconditional_update' when using pre-trained model that used batchnorm</summary>
	<description>
When trying to use tf.keras.applications that use bacthnorm(like mobilenet or inceptionv3) i'm getting:
'Operation' object has no attribute '_unconditional_update'
Other keras.applications that do not use batch-norm(like vgg) work fine with the same code.
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): debian  8
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): conda
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3
Python version: 3.8.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: Nvidia titan xp

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
When trying to use tf.keras.applications that use bacthnorm(like mobilenet or inceptionv3) i'm getting:
'Operation' object has no attribute '_unconditional_update' when running fit
Other keras.applications that do not use batch-norm(like vgg) work fine with the same code.
Describe the expected behavior
to be able to run fit on keras.applications models
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
use applications model: model_base = keras.applications.InceptionV3(input_shape=INPUT_SIZE,weights = "imagenet",include_top=False)
add fully connected layers to it and then call fit()

Can you please share colab link or simple standalone code with supporting files to reproduce the issue in our environment.It helps us in localizing the issue faster.Thanks!

		I tried to isolate it,i found that this happens when eager mode is disabled with tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() , i disable it because i need to export a .pb file for deployment and export fails if eager is enabled, so it seems using pre-trained model(for transfer learning) with batch norm is mutually exclusive with exporting .pb file for deploy: i can do transfer learning but not deploy it, or i can deploy it but not with pre-trained model that uses batch-norm
