	<summary>ModelCheckpoint can't use "val_acc" even if fit() function receives validation_data argument</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.0.0-rc0-gpu
Python version: 3.6.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0
GPU model and memory: NVidia Tesla P100 (16 gb)

Describe the current behavior
Recently I switched from TF1 wrapped with native Keras to TF2 using the built-in tf.keras implementation. In my code I train my model like so:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(auto_save_path, monitor="val_acc", save_best_only=True)
callbacks.append(checkpoint)

keras_model.fit_generator(training_img_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=20, validation_steps=100,
    validation_data=validation_img_generator, callbacks=callbacks)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, with that code I do get the following warning message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING:tensorflow:Can save best model only with val_acc available, skipping.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

A full working example can be found as &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/haimat/65e9dddc9cd8004ea8870853f84d7b02&gt;Github Gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Describe the expected behavior
I don't understand this error, because I do provide the validation_data argument to the fit_generator() function. Also, I used exactly the same code with Keras on top of TF1, which worked fine there. This warning came now after switching to TF2 and built-in Keras API.

 I'm facing the same issue as you when using ModelCheckpoint in 2.0-rc0. As a work-around, I used tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-beta1 instead and changed 'val_acc' to 'val_accuracy' and the warning disappeared.
By the way, if you're using CSV logger, please also note that column names 'acc'  and 'val_acc' has been changed to 'accuracy' and 'val_accuracy' respectively.
Hope this helps.

		Any chance this will be fixed for the next RC or the final 2.0 release?

So unfortunately this has not been fixed in RC1.
Can you at least tell me if there are plans to fix this any time soon, for final 2.0 release?
If not, is there some kind of workaround (instead of going back to beta1)?

is there some kind of workaround

Looking into this issue, in the meantime compiling with "accuracy" and using "val_accuracy" in ModelCheckpoint should work

		Ok, so it seems with rc2 if you use "val_accuracy" it works fine.
I dom't know whether this is the final solution for TF2 or just a workaround, but fine for me for now.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?

 Sorry for the late reply, in TF2.0 it should use whatever you compiled with, i.e.  will log as "val_acc", otherwise it will log as "val_accuracy"
