	<summary>Layer test does not set weights when testing with Sequential API</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: No
OS Platform and Distribution: macOS 10.15
TensorFlow installed from: pip installed
TensorFlow version: 1.14.0 (v1.14.0-rc1-22-gaf24dc91b5)
Python version: 3.6

Current Behaviour
When using the layer_test util function in keras.testing_utils when testing the layer in the context of the Sequential API the weights are not set, and as a result the output of the layer will be different than expected. If expected_output is provided this will likely differ to the output from the layer and hence the test will fail.
I think that the weights on the layer should be set before calling the sequential model which can be solved with one extra line. This is done for all of the other tests already.
model = keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(layer)
# add `layer.set_weights(weights)` here to fix problem
actual_output = model.predict(input_data)
...
if expected_output is not None:
  np.testing.assert_allclose(actual_output, expected_output, rtol=1e-3)
