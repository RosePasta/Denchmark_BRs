	<summary>Windows Tensorflow load large than 4GB file will meet outOfRange error.</summary>
	<description>
System information
-OS Platform and Distribution: Windows
-TensorFlow installed from: binary
-TensorFlow version: 1.0.1, 1.15
-Python version: 3.6
Describe the current behavior
Tensorflow load large than 4GB file on Windows will meet outOfRange error.
Other info / logs
Tensorflow Windows version's file stat function by default use _wstat which represents the file size as 32-bit integer, once load large than 4GB file on Windows will meet outOfRange error. So I change the default to use _wstat64 which represents the file size as 64-bit integer to fix the issue.

		Does this manifest on master?

		The bug can be reproduced on TF 1.15 and I've tested the fix it worked. The related code has not changed for 3 years, so the master branch should have the same issue.
