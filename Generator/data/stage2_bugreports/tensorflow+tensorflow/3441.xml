	<summary>Documentation for 'Adding a new op'</summary>
	<description>
This is a feature request. Currently, I find the documentation for 'Adding an Op' quite minimal. There are a few important questions that remain unanswered:

How should one use multithreaded CPU code in an operation? Can we use OpenMP? How many threads should an op use? It is hard to find this in the implementations of existing ops, because they are all based on Eigen.
How should a GPU version of the op be written? Should it be a cuda kernel, or the code spawning cuda kernels? Maybe there could be a simple example for both CPU and GPU code not using Eigen.

		Can I use C++ threads in the CPU implementation of an op? And how should I choose the number of threads to use?

		I'm also interested in using CPU threads in an op. Did you ever figure it out &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tvogels&gt;@tvogels&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		No, sorry, I left it single threaded

 No problem, thanks anyway

		In random_op.cc, there is an example of a multi-threaded op in the CPUDevice FillPhiloxRandom:

It uses the Shard function declared in work_sharder.h to split work across multiple threads.

		Brilliant thank you very much! That's my weekend sorted :)

		Some documentation has been added, and should be available when documentation is next rebuilt.
