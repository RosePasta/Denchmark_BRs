You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
tf.math.reduce_mean hangs(?) or takes forever to compute for certain input (with dtype uint64 and uint32, and axis an array). Around when the slow down occurs, the function produces incorrect result.
This function affects other functions' performance: tf.math.reduce_std which calls tf.math.reduce_variance which calls tf.math.reduce_mean
Describe the expected behavior
It should not take forever to compute nor produce an incorrect result.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
An example that showed incorrect result:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import time

input_tensor = np.arange(4).astype('uint64')  # also occurs for 'uint32'

for i in range(20):
  axis = [0] * i
  print('axis = ', axis)
  start = time.time()
  res = tf.math.reduce_mean(input_tensor, axis=axis)
  end = time.time()
  time_diff = end - start
  print('result = ', res.numpy())
  print('-- took %d sec --' % time_diff)
An example that both became extremely slow and produced an incorrect result:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import time

# 15 is a magic number chosen for illustration
# a smaller number may not cause the slow-down but could still show the wrong result
input_tensor = np.arange(15).astype('uint64')  # also occurs for 'uint32'

for i in range(20):
  # produces incorrect result when i == 8.
  # slow down occurs around when i == 10
  axis = [0] * i
  print('axis = ', axis)
  start = time.time()
  res = tf.math.reduce_mean(input_tensor, axis=axis)
  end = time.time()
  time_diff = end - start
  print('result = ', res.numpy())
  print('-- took %d sec --' % time_diff)
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		I have tried in colab with TF version 2.1.0 ,2.2.0 and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/5261bff929134c88bd17f6fd57e05c39/untitled904.ipynb&gt;here.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
