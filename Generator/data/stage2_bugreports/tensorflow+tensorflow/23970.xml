	<summary>yolo-v3 has correctness issue at tf-nightly</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):NA
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Centos 7.5
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:NA
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):  tf-nightly==1.13.0.dev20181115
Python version: 3.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA


Start from tf-nightly==1.13.0.dev20181115, yolo-v3(&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mystic123/tensorflow-yolo-v3&gt;https://github.com/mystic123/tensorflow-yolo-v3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) meet correctness issue, the TF output did not consistent with the previous version

With same command, tf-nightly==1.13.0.dev20181114 can get the right result and plot the bounding box.

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		We have seen similar issue with Resnet50 where accuracy drops to a very low number. This commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0c1eb8861624d6d17c797b70d25330711df5eb2f&gt;0c1eb88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seems to be causing the issue.

 the commit your provided is not the root cause for yolov3, after check, this commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/89fa3c5ed66a4e543ba01c31febf3edb417808d0&gt;89fa3c5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should be the yolov3 correctness regression commit. this commit update the Eigen version.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martinwicke&gt;@martinwicke&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , can you please check this accuracy issue? Thanks.

, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guizili0&gt;@guizili0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 pointed at the Eigen update leading to a regression in YOLO quality.
This is sadly a very ill-defined regression -- &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guizili0&gt;@guizili0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you have any hints as to where this regression may manifest itself, i.e., where (which op) results start to differ?

 the commit shoule be &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/89fa3c5ed66a4e543ba01c31febf3edb417808d0&gt;89fa3c5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

can you check it? thanks.

 this is a commit updating Eigen. Since Eigen underlies almost all (CPU) computations in TensorFlow, the commit unfortunately doesn't help much in narrowing it down.

 it is hard for me to find the regression commit in Eigen, do you have any suggestion about this?

 may have some pointers for where to start.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rmlarsen&gt;@rmlarsen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , we would like to track down the correctness issue for yolo-v3 that this regression commit seems to have introduced.

		Is this problem still being observed in recently nightly builds?
