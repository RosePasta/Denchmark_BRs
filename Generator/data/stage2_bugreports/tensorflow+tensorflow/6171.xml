		Seems like that should be `six.iteritems(dict)`

  Is there more documentation for this tool.  The tool's output is hard to analysis for me.

_TFProfRoot (0us/312.56ms), what is the meaning of 0us, and what is the meaning of 312.56ms.

		I will add more docs.

x/y. x is the current ops stats. y is aggregated stats of itself and all
its descendants (according to name scopes)
In your case, the number is the sum of execution times of all ops.
