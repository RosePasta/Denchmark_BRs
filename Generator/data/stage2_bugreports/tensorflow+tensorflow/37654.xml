	<summary>Subclass of `tf.keras.Model` returns an empty list by `model.losses`</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):  yes, as follows

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    def call(self, inputs):
        self.add_loss(tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(inputs)))
        return inputs

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 5])
model = MyModel()
model(x)

model.losses  # returns []
model._losses # returns [&lt;tf.Tensor 'my_model/Mean:0' shape=() dtype=float32&gt;]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Catalina, 10.15.3
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.12.0
Python version: Python 2.7.17 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct 21 2019, 14:10:59)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] on darwin

Describe the current behavior
The current returned value of model.losses does not contain elements in model._losses
Describe the expected behavior
As we can see in the code of Network.losses, it should return
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;list(set(relevant_conditional_losses + unconditional_losses + self._losses))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If it does not contain tensors in model._losses, model.add_loss will not take any effects.

		Hi. I am new here but want to contribute.
So, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/siyuany&gt;@siyuany&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if this is what you are talking about :
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/7a39b6c62d43c25472b2c2476bd2a8983ae4f682/keras/engine/network.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 line no : 400
(link not working... please copy paste in new tab)
then we see that in line 439, we are returning 
So, will you please be little specific. Please dont mind if i am wrong coz i am totally new and just want to get a hang and contribute. Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/siyuany&gt;@siyuany&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Ok, are you saying we are not adding  to the returned list?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/siyuany&gt;@siyuany&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I see that  is initialized as empty list. Will you please tell where is  getting updated ?
I mean in which file?

Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HopefulRational&gt;@HopefulRational&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think you're talking about the independent keras. But I refer to the keras in tensorflow, . So the source codes are not the same. BTW, it works fine if I subclass  in the independent keras.

Hi @siyuany. I see that self._losses is initialized as empty list. Will you please tell where is self._losses getting updated ?
I mean in which file?




tensorflow/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/network.py


         Line 679
      in
      5b900cf






 return losses 





I think maybe here the property should return list(set(losses + self._losses)), or else losses added by model.add_loss will not be contained in the final list.
You can check the following scripts
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.python.eager import context
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils import tf_utils


class MyModel(keras.Model):

  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)

  def call(self, inputs):
    self.add_loss(tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(inputs)))
    return inputs


x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 5])
model = MyModel()
model(x)

print('model.losses: ', model.losses)  # returns []
print('model._losses: ', model._losses)
# returns [&lt;tf.Tensor 'my_model/Mean:0' shape=() dtype=float32&gt;]


def losses(self):
  # this function is copied from `Network.losses`, but revised the line commented.
  losses = self._unfiltered_losses
  if context.executing_eagerly():
    return losses
  relevant_inputs = []
  for i in range(0, len(self._inbound_nodes)):
    inputs = self.get_input_at(i)
    if isinstance(inputs, list):
      relevant_inputs += inputs
    else:
      relevant_inputs.append(inputs)
  ########## revised here!  ##########
  if not relevant_inputs:  
    # return losses
    return list(set(losses + self._losses))
  ###############################
  reachable = tf_utils.get_reachable_from_inputs(relevant_inputs, losses)
  relevant_conditional_losses = [x for x in losses if x in reachable]
  unconditional_losses = [x for x in losses if x._unconditional_loss]  # pylint: disable=protec
  return list(
    set(relevant_conditional_losses + unconditional_losses + self._losses))


print(losses(model))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/siyuany&gt;@siyuany&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks for such a quick reply.
I am sorry. I thought that the two keras are equivalent in implementation. I want to know where are we filling .
I think that in the  :
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/97103c3b9b447a9889be93fa36324b3ed3daf377/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer.py#L1172&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(again link is not working please copy paste link in new tab)
we are putting symbolic losses in  and thats the only thing we are putting in . Am I right?
And would you please also tell me how to link a line like the way you linked line 679. Thanks.

		It seems in tensorflow==1.15.0 the issue has been fixed.

Hi @siyuany. Thanks for such a quick reply.
I am sorry. I thought that the two keras are equivalent in implementation. I want to know where are we filling model._losses.
I think that in the add_loss :
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/97103c3b9b447a9889be93fa36324b3ed3daf377/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/base_layer.py#L1172
(again link is not working please copy paste link in new tab)
we are putting symbolic losses in model._losses and thats the only thing we are putting in model._losses. Am I right?
And would you please also tell me how to link a line like the way you linked line 679. Thanks.

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HopefulRational&gt;@HopefulRational&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes, it's the same as I understand.
For the second question, You can just click the line no., click the three dots in the left, and select 'copy permalink', and just paste the link in an isolated line, no extra characters at all. You can try.

. Thanks for quick reply.
So, I see that  is not there.
Is it that in , we are filling  and by  we are returning losses to solve the issue?
Thanks again. You have been very kind :-)

Thanks again. You have been very kind :-)

The bug had been fixed in higher version (tf&gt;1.12), so I just closed this issue.
