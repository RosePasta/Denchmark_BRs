	<summary>Can't enforce shape invariants with TensorArrays in while_loop</summary>
	<description>
I can't enforce shape invariants in a while_loop if one of the inputs is a TensorArray. Here's a minimal example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf

def body(i,ta):
    ta = ta.write(i,1.0)
    return (i+1,ta)

arr_size = 10
ta = tf.TensorArray(tf.float32, size=arr_size)

i = tf.constant(0,tf.int32)
input = (i,ta)
cond = lambda i,_ : i &lt; arr_size
output = tf.while_loop(cond, body,input,shape_invariants=(i.get_shape(),tf.TensorShape(arr_size)))

#works fine without shape_invariants:
#output = tf.while_loop(cond, body,input)

mat = output[1].stack()
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
print(mat.eval())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The code above works fine if the while_loop is not fed shape_invariants. Using shape_invariants though, I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: The shape invariant specified for TensorArray:1 is not compatible with the initial shape of the loop variable. It enters the loop with shape &lt;unknown&gt;, but the specified shape invariant is (10,).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?
Thanks!

		I think this problem is better suited for StackOverflow as apparently it's not bug with TensorFlow itself. They monitor there under the TensorFlow tag as well.

 Why do you think it is not a bug?

		TensorArray objects have a shape invariant value of None.  This is a
documentation bug.
