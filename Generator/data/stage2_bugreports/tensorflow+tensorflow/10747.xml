	<summary>Striding behaviour different between caffe and tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary (pip install)
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('v1.2.0-rc2-21-g12f033d', '1.2.0')
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0
GPU model and memory: Tesla P100-SXM2 16MB
Exact command to reproduce: python caffe_to_tf_test.py

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Caffe convolution produce different results then tensorflow with the same parameters.   This has something to do with striding - the attached test fails with striding equal to 2, and succeeds with striding equal to 1.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

		Could you show the weights and tensors outputs from this program? I don't have both TensorFlow and Caffe installed. If the tensor is too big to show can you try to create a very small example like on a 3x3 image with a 2x2 filter?

Here is a zip file with the (random) weights, (random) biases, caffe output and TF output in .npy format.

		How hard is this to repro on a very small example i.e. 1x4x4x1 image and 1 channel in 1 channel out filter of size 2 or 3? That might make it clearer what the problem is.

		I can't do much smaller, but here is a 1x16x16x1 with a kernel size 7

		P.S.  You can run a docker image of caffe from here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/docker&gt;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/docker&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

then simply pip install tensorflow

		this might be the issue?

Center Padding is happening in Gemmlowp,
is this you wanted.?
"tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_conv_ops.cc"
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        // What we're doing here is trying to copy and fill the im2col
         // buffer as efficiently as possible, using functions to set or
         // duplicate values en masse. We know we don't have to worry about
         // vertical edges because we dealt with that case above, so we
         // just need to handle filters that overlap the left or right
         // edges. Here's what that looks like:
         //
         // &lt; left_zero_count &gt; &lt; center_copy_count &gt; &lt; right_zero_count &gt;
         // +------------------+---------------------+--------------------+
         // |     (filter)     |       (image)       |      (filter)      |
         // +------------------+---------------------+--------------------+
         // in_x_origin        0                 input_width       in_x_end
         //
         // In reality it's unlikely that a filter patch will be wider
         // than an input, but this shows all the edge cases.
         // We use memset() to set the left and right sections to zeroes
         // and memcpy() to copy over the input data for the center. These
         // are preferred to std::fill and std::copy because they're much
         // faster on Android.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

, are you still looking at padding strategies in tf?

		Not really, but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yzhwang&gt;@yzhwang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 recently fixed a padding bug. I'm going to assume the issue is fixed since that was the only known padding bug; &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/amnonh-uw&gt;@amnonh-uw&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, please reopen if that's not the case in 1.7.
