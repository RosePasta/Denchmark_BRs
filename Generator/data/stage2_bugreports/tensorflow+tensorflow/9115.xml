 The tensorflow.org/code/... redirector service seems to return 404 for valid  paths. Could App Engine be intercepting those requests?

		Ooh, this is an interesting one. My current hypothesis: app engine routing doesn't like path segments with a leading underscore, maybe an overzealous check for routes like _ah?
Another failing sample url: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/labeled_tensor/python/ops/_typecheck.py&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/labeled_tensor/python/ops/_typecheck.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fails to route to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/labeled_tensor/python/ops/_typecheck.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/labeled_tensor/python/ops/_typecheck.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I'm going to file an internal bug to find out more. (I couldn't turn anything up in a Google search.)

		I believe that's an internal issue to our docs hosting system.  We'll look into it.  Thanks.

		As of now, those links are rewritten to point to github.com/ links, although pre-v1.1 documentation will not  be updated. So, on the scalar_summary page, it now points to:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow/contrib/deprecated/__init__.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
