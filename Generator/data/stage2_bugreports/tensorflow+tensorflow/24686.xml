	<summary>tf.print  can't print log in jupyter notebook.</summary>
	<description>
When I tried to use tf.print() or get the log_device_placement information in google colabratory. I just can't get the print output. I tried in my own jupyter, and I find the print log is in the cmd.exe windows. This behavior is very strange and I think it should be fixed.  The code is like below.
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')
b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))
print(sess.run(c))
the print output is just like this:

v1.12.0-0-ga6d8ffae09 1.12.0
[[22. 28.]
[49. 64.]]

but it should be with the log_device_placement information.

		By adding tf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.INFO) in your script you should be able to see the logging in the ipython console.

Thank you very much. But I tried this, it does't work. The reason of this problem maybe in the cooperation of tensorflow and Jupyter notebook. Because I can see the log information in the cmd.exe window which runs  jupyter.

		I think you're right, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lyhue1991&gt;@lyhue1991&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . It's a known limitation of tf.print, see RFC:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/14/files#diff-6dc73e00aed7c8a7fbc0f53d7981f296R365&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/14/files#diff-6dc73e00aed7c8a7fbc0f53d7981f296R365&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Thank you very much. This limitation is really painful.

 Hi, Tomer. Could you answer the question?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facaiy&gt;@facaiy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 what question still needs answering?
As you mentioned this is still a known limitation, because Jupyter notebooks don't capture C++ output.
We've decided to not add python-specific logic at this time (which we could do by running py_funcs internally) because it would prevent universal exporting of models that use tf.print
I've bumped the relevant issue on the ipython kernel's github:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/issues/110&gt;ipython/ipykernel#110&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For anyone who needs a workaround there's a number of scattered code on the internet that tries to redirect C++ outputs to ipython, e.g.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/minrk/wurlitzer&gt;https://github.com/minrk/wurlitzer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for your detailed explanation, and workaround :-) So can we close the issue, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lyhue1991&gt;@lyhue1991&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?

 Yeah, maybe the best approach to solve this problem is to let ipykernel capture output coming from C and C++ libraries. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tomerk&gt;@tomerk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thank you for your explanation.

		Just an update to this: We've actually come up with a solution to this inside of tensorflow, that should now be in the nightlies.

		If you are here for tf.Print in tf1:
When you use google colab, you can see the output in the runtime logs (runtime menu).
When you use jupyter lab (if it's your server) you need to check your terminal (from which you have launched jupyter lab).

 is  not currently printing in the cell output in both colab notebooks and jupyter notebooks? It should be, and if it's not we've had a regression and should fix it.
(Note that tf.Print in tf1 is not the same as tf.print)

 I'm talking about  in tf1.  works just fine. I had a bunch of pages talking about  and I answered here thinking it was another page. I will edit my text to avoid any confusion.
