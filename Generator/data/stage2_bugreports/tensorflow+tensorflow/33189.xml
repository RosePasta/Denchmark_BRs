	<summary>TFTRT:  Huge events file generated.</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.14
Python version:2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:10.1
GPU model and memory:T4

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
Very very large events files  are generated  when TF-TRT is enabled.  These files are so big that Tensorboard is able to handle those.  For example,  in one network, TF produces an event file of 4.6 MB size. The  same network after TF-TRT compile, generates an event file of 1.3 GB !!
Describe the expected behavior
A reasonable size.
Code to reproduce the issue
Not able to provide any code at this point.   However, the sympton is possibly reproducible with any large network such as ResNet1XX .

 Could you provide more details on TF-TRT compile so that we can find root-cause of the issue. If you can provide any standalone code would be better. Thanks!
