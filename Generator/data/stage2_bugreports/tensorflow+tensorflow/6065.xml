	<summary>Bug: _linear's optional scope argument is ignored</summary>
	<description>
Here is the relevant code from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def _linear(args, output_size, bias, bias_start=0.0, scope=None):
  # ...
  scope = vs.get_variable_scope()
  with vs.variable_scope(scope) as outer_scope:
    # ...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Update: A fix was proposed a few days ago in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/6009&gt;#6009&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Leaving this open until that fix is accepted.

 "It is hidden for a reason; you should not be using it. Use tf.contrib.layers.linear instead. The scope argument will be removed soon."
