	<summary>iPhone 6 crash: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION in v1.14.0-rc1</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Compiled on MacOS 10.14.5
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
iPhone6, iOS 11.4
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Source
iOS tensorflow lib built with the script: tensorflow/contrib/makefile/build_all_ios.sh
TensorFlow version (use command below):
v1.14.0-rc1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
XCode 10.2.1

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the current behavior
I have written an iOS app that uses TensorFlow from C++.
The app crashes on Session::Run() with Thread 6: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=1, subcode=0xd53be053)
XCode breaks and highlights an assembler line 329: -&gt;  0x1014e7f30 &lt;+1308&gt;: mrs    x19, CNTVCT_EL0
Describe the expected behavior
No crash. The same app built with TensorFlow v1.13.1 runs successfully.

This appears to have been introduced with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9a486811ca07b5ca3f60f6fd96e69fc1df889818&gt;9a486811ca07b5ca3f60f6fd96e69fc1df889818&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which was not in 1.13.1 but is in 1.14.0-rc0.
It introduces the struct , which calls  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v1.14.0-rc1/tensorflow/core/platform/profile_utils/cpu_utils.h#L58&gt;cpu_utils.h&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on initialization. On aarch64, this calls  which is the line XCode breaks on.
If I &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/travbid/tensorflow/commit/8b6b0d2ddb7fb3262c41f471e5f299b9ee377560#diff-5f82d595cba7425ac17d71e7615343d9&gt;exit that function with an early return&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 then the session runs without crashing.
After consulting the &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/latest/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile&gt;armv8 reference guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the instruction in question looks right to me and can be found in other code samples with a google search.
Unfortunately, I don't have any other iOS devices to test on currently.
I know little about assembler or ARM architectures and have reached the limits of my debugging ability here. Could this be a hardware bug in iPhone 6? Any insight appreciated.

		I have the same problem when I try to use my iPhone 6s plus or my iPad Pro 11" A1980 with Tensorflow 2.0.0-beta. When I test my application using the simulator (any of them), I can execute the method Session::Run() correctly. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/travbid&gt;@travbid&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, did you find out a solution for this problem?

 I worked around this by editing cpu_utils.h as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/travbid/tensorflow/commit/8b6b0d2ddb7fb3262c41f471e5f299b9ee377560#diff-5f82d595cba7425ac17d71e7615343d9&gt;travbid@8b6b0d2#diff-5f82d595cba7425ac17d71e7615343d9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and re-compiling TensorFlow.

 It also worked for me. Thanks.

 , can we get this fixed? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ymodak&gt;@ymodak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		1.14 is old and unsupported. contrib is no longer maintained. Makefile build is only community supported.

 , I understand, but the issue is fundamentally one about  library file. Apparently,  is a privileged instruction on Apple devices.
Moreover, it still occurs in 1.15 (which is still supposed to be supported for a few more months)

		Can you send a patch to 1.15  branch please? Mention me in the PR.

		Patch landed, we can close this now. Patch release will come today/tomorrow

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
