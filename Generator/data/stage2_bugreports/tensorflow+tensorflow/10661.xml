	<summary>tf.train.Scaffold missing global_step attribute</summary>
	<description>
According to the docstring of tf.train.Scaffold, there is a global_step attribute with the following description:

global_step: A tensor containing the global step counter.  Picked
from and stored into the GLOBAL_STEP collection in the graph by default.

(see 


tensorflow/tensorflow/python/training/monitored_session.py


         Line 84
      in
      f60b6bd






   * `global_step`: A tensor containing the global step counter.  Picked 




)
The problem is that no such attribute actually exists.

		It's a wrong documentation. I'll fix the documentation. History: Global step was part of the Scaffold when we were prototyping the first versions. We removed it while it was getting mature.
