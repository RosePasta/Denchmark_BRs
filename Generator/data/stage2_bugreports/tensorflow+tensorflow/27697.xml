Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): use plugin
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-py3
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.14.1-dev20190409
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the current behavior
As of 1.14.1-dev20190409, custom plugins fail to build with the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  In file included from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/include/tensorflow/core/framework/op_def_builder.h:24:0,

                                          ^
  compilation terminated.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This seems to be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6168f476b52d6d40eeff1823943ed2c0ea28adde&gt;6168f47&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  It appears that not all the files are placed in the proper locations after the installation.
Describe the expected behavior
Plugins should build successfully.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ docker run -it --rm tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-py3
# apt install -y mpich
# HOROVOD_WITH_TENSORFLOW=1 pip install -v horovod
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

 Is tf addons somehow using this BUILD file?

		<comment id='6' author='alsrgv' date='2019-04-10T20:34:52Z'>
		We don't use the BUILD file itself. We link to the pre-compiled libtensorflow_framework.
It looks like the op_def.pb header file is referencinng a file which is not where it is expected after the new protobuf install.

		Looks like the problem is when creating the pip package, we missed to copy header files that has .inc extension.

		Hi,
I experience this problem with 1.14.0 . From what I see in the sources, as well as bananabowl's comment / reference to the cherry picks, the needed changes are in 1.14.0. Still getting the problem.
Here is the error:

		I tried the master branch. Interestingly it seems to be 1.13.1 (because the generated PIP file is tensorflow-1.13.1-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl). The problem persist but it could be that master is not the right branch (is not actively used). Is it?

		ok guys, right, I found the file. The problem was that I needed to add the path to protobuf_archive to the include path of the compiler. I compiles now and it works! (I had asserts with 1.12.0 on batch inference which are gone).

		Hi,
what I did for my program was to pass a -I param to the compiler, so it does know where to look for the files.
I use a Makefile, and also export a TENSORFLOW_PATH variable, which contains the path to the headers. The headers can be extracted with a bazel target. For me the flag to gcc is :
-I$(TENSORFLOW_PATH)/external/protobuf_archive/src
