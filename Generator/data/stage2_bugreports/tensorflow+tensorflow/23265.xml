	<summary>No example exporting a model from an Estimator on TensorFlow.org</summary>

System information

TensorFlow version: 1.9

Describe the documentation issue
In this CNN tutorial example, there is no exporting savedmodel example. For users that need to save the trained model for future usage, it will be better to add exporting savedmodel part in the tutorial.
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/karmel&gt;@karmel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  I don't think we have a single modern Estimator -&gt; saved_model example.
Do you know who the right person to ask is?

		There's a section in the SavedModel guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model#savedmodels_from_estimators&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model#savedmodels_from_estimators&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But maybe we should have an example in the Estimator guide too.
