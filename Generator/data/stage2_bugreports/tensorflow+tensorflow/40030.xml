Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.7.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1/ V10.1.105
GPU model and memory: Geforce MX110 2GB

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
I created a simple model using tf.keras Sequential API and printed its metrics but it is outputting an empty list. No matter what I try, It returns an empty list.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
It should return
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[&lt;tensorflow.python.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy at 0x7f3e5e218320&gt;,
 &lt;tensorflow.python.keras.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError at 0x7f3e5c063a20&gt;]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Standalone code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, MaxPool2D
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(16,(3,3),padding='same', input_shape=(1,28,28),data_format='channels_first'),
    MaxPooling2D((3,3), data_format='channels_first')
])
opt = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.005)
model.compile(optimizer=opt,
              loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),
              metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy(),
              tf.keras.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError()]
              )
print(model.metrics)
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		I have tried in colab with TF version 2.2, nightly version and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/596178d7832c35f15db66df49febf958/untitled939.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.However i am not seeing any issue with TF version 2.1.0 .Thanks!

 This is expected and was notified in the  of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases&gt;2.2.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

Keras compile/fit behavior for functional and subclassed models have been unified. Model properties such as metrics, metrics_names will now be available only after training/evaluating the model on actual data for functional models. metrics will now include model loss and output losses.loss_functions property has been removed from the model. This was an undocumented property that was accidentally public and has now been removed.

Please close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!

		I tried this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/596178d7832c35f15db66df49febf958/untitled939.ipynb#scrollTo=kLDcDwDEWAsl&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 notebook but still, it is not showing metrics.

 As mentioned in the Release notes (Breaking changes), some functionality was unified. It will show the metrics only after training/evaluating the model on . Try to run training () or  and let us know whether you can see the metrics or not. Thanks!

		Yes, It is showing on model.fit. Thanks

		I still can reproduce the error on tf 2.4.0, using author's code. Any updates on this?

@ahmadmustafaanis As mentioned in the Release notes (Breaking changes), some functionality was unified. It will show the metrics only after training/evaluating the model on actual data. Try to run training (model.fit) or model.train_on_batch and let us know whether you can see the metrics or not. Thanks!

 As mentioned in the above comment, you need to run  or  with actual or toy data. Thanks!
