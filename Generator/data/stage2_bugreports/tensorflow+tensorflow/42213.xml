Describe the current behavior
tf.nn.max_pool3d crashes(floating point exception) when input is of type np.float16 AND strides=0 AND padding='SAME'
Describe the expected behavior
expect no crashes
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
input = tf.ones((1,1,1,1,1), dtype=np.float16)
tf.nn.max_pool3d(input=input, ksize=1, strides=0, padding='SAME')
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

I tried in colab and i am not seeing any issue if we give give  in code.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/a7183951523b0c440a894f53267c1e80/untitled237.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but   crashes(floating point exception) when input is of type np.float16 AND strides=0 AND padding='SAME'.
Thanks!

		I am able to reproduce the issue in colab with TF 2.3, nightly versions().Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/b1538e804cb9ede63700c745e895c179/untitled238.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

,

We shouldn't set strides = 0 neither in Convolutional Layers nor in Pooling Layers, as the minimum Striding Window should be of Size 1.
Regarding the Input with Data Type, float16, the Model works fine if we use Keras Mixed Precision Experimental Policy. Please find the Gist with working code. Thanks!

 Thanks for the clarification! Though an exception sounds better than crash (segfault) :)
