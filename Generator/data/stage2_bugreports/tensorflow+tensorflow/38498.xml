	<summary>Currently logs param is None for on_train_end() and on_test_end()</summary>
	<description>
You can see the current implementation of  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L950&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L1180&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) methods that the logs passed to the methods  and  are None which is as per the documentation can be changed in future.
In tensorflow/addons, There is addition of  callback. And recently I have raised PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/1649&gt;#1649&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to add code to make progress bar work in case of  too.
Here, we came across the problem that there are  passed to  method to update the progress bar. But after the epoch is complete and when  method is called, there are no  passed to that. Because of this, there is no metrics results passed to the method. But in my opinion and also from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shun-lin&gt;@shun-lin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/1649#issuecomment-612785521&gt;#1649 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it is good to pass logs which are output from the last call to  method. Currenly in tqdm callback, we are storing the  logs in class variable and using them in , which we think is temporary fix.
