Describe the documentation issue
In the "Install TensorFlow with pip", section "3. Install the TensorFlow pip package", the sentence "tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0-gpu â€”Preview TF 2.0 Alpha build with GPU support (unstable, Ubuntu and Windows)" is wrong.
It's should "tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-alpha0" instead of "tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0-gpu"
Because I can't install with "pip install --upgrade tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0-gpu"
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
