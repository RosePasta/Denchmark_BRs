	<summary>Linear alpha shape does not match the number of input channels.Node number 9 (GpuDelegate) failed to prepare.</summary>
	<description>
Dear TensorFlow developer,
I implemented my custom model in my app. And I tried to set GPU delegate.
But if I instantiate Interpreter with GPU delegate option, the following error occurs.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Linear alpha shape does not match the number of input channels.Node number 9 (GpuDelegate) failed to prepare.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What does this error message suppose to mean?
Or is there anything I need to be careful on TFLite converting?
Anything would be helpful.
Thanks!
The model I used is here.

		Thank you for your post. We noticed you have not filled out the fields in the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new?template=10-build-installation-issue.md&gt;template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Could you update them if they are relevant in your case, or leave them as N/A? Along with the template, please provide as many details as possible to find the root cause of the issue. It would be great if you can provide a small code to reproduce the error. Thanks!

		Thank you for your reply.
Issue template is shown below.
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS 10.14.2
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: on Simulator and on Samsung Galaxy S8
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version: 0.0.0-gpu-experimental
Python version: N/A
Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?: N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Android Studio version: 3.3


I implemented my custom model in my app following the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/gpu&gt;TensorFlow Lite GPU Delegate Tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The code of essensial part is below. The model I used in this code is already attached on above comment.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import org.tensorflow.lite.Interpreter;
import org.tensorflow.lite.experimental.GpuDelegate;

GpuDelegate delegate = new GpuDelegate();
Interpreter.Options options = (new Interpreter.Options()).addDelegate(delegate);
Interpreter interpreter = new Interpreter(model, options);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When interpreter is instantiated, the following error occurs.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Linear alpha shape does not match the number of input channels.Node number 9 (GpuDelegate) failed to prepare. 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What does this error message suppose to mean?
Need any special process when converting to tflite model in order to use GPU delegate?
Thanks!

 have you observed this before?

 No, I haven't seen this, but then again, I haven't seen models with PReLU flying by (that's where you get this error message).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ksekine&gt;@ksekine&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Sorry for quite a belated response on this; I just got looped in.  The error message means that the tensor shapes and network don't match.  It was checking whether the tensor's channel size matches the linear alpha vector size in PReLU, but looks like there was a mismatch?

		Thanks for the information that PReLU is the cause.
I can work around this issue by removing PReLU from the model.
So I'll close this issue if no one else is in trouble.
