	<summary>TFRecordWriter doesn't throw an error when disk partition gets out of space</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When tensorflow.python_io.TFRecordWriter(path) is initialized with a path leading to a device out of free storage space, one can still write() and close() it without receiving an error or exception. The resulting file is empty (0B).
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

TF v.1.0.1 installed from pip3 (package tensorflow-gpu) with Python 3.4.2 on a Linux server.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Minimal example&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;writer = tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter(output_file)
for i in files_in_shard:
  # ....
  # [prepare record]
  writer.write(example.SerializeToString())
writer.close()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Working example e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/data/build_image_data.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/data/build_image_data.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This is still an issue with v1.7.0. A loop that writes one record each iteration happily continues when the disk has run out of space.
