	<summary>tf.matching_files fails when there is a file with wrong permissions in a subdirectory</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip installed binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.8
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA
Exact command to reproduce: see below

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.framework.graph_util import convert_variables_to_constants

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    output1 = tf.matching_files('/some/dir', name='output1', )
    sess = tf.InteractiveSession(graph=graph)
    print(sess.run([output1]))
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This simple script fails if some dir contains a file without read access somewhere in subfolders of /some/dir. So for instance if I don't have permission to read /some/dir/subfolder/filebelongingtosomeoneelse, the script fails (while I have permissions for subfolder).
Strange thing is that neither read access needed to know its filename, nor it is actually will be listed in the output (so it should be skipped during scanning).
