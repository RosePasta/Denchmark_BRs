	<summary>PReLU operation throws error on tflite android benchmark tool with gpu</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: Redmi Note 8 pro
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Google Colab Tensorflow Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): tf  1.15 and tf 2.2
Python version: 3.6.9

Describe the current behavior
I converted a tf.keras model with PReLU operation into tflite format. The android tflite benchmark tool throws an error on the model with the default PReLU settings of shared_axes=Null
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;adb shell /data/local/tmp/benchmark_model_tf15 --graph=/data/local/tmp/prelu_model1.tflite --enable_op_profiling=true --use_gpu=true

INFO: Initialized TensorFlow Lite runtime.
INFO: Created TensorFlow Lite delegate for GPU.
**ERROR: TfLiteGpuDelegate Init: PRELU: Dimensions are not HWC**
ERROR: TfLiteGpuDelegate Prepare: delegate is not initialized
ERROR: Node number 2 (TfLiteGpuDelegateV2) failed to prepare.

ERROR: Restored previous execution plan after delegate application failure.
Failed to apply GPU delegate.
Benchmarking failed.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Now, with option shared_axes=[1,2], it runs the model without any error on gpu.
Also, the model runs without any error on CPU  in both settings.
Describe the expected behavior
The tflite model with default PReLU settings (i.e no shared axes ), should run without any errors on gpu delegate in android.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Colab Notebook: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pZRaeUB7Gj1HU1BR9DcSI6SxHfdsWbD_#scrollTo=_63mXS3A1m0r&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pZRaeUB7Gj1HU1BR9DcSI6SxHfdsWbD_#scrollTo=_63mXS3A1m0r&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs

prelu_model1.tflite: No shared axes and does not run on gpu
prelu_model2.tflite: Has shared_axes=[1,2] and runs on gpu
prelu_models.zip

The behaviour seems to be same for tf 2.2 models and corresponding android benchmark tools.
How can we make it run on gpu with default settings ie. no shared _axes?

Now, with option shared_axes=[1,2], it runs the model without any error on gpu.
This is an issue specific to the gpu delegate implementation. The error msg is emitted here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/gpu/common/model_builder_helper.cc#L252-L254


Also, the model runs without any error on CPU in both settings.

 So is it a bug? How can we fix it and properly run the model using gpu delegate ?

		We have a candidate and will check with your models.  Stay tuned :)

		Ok.  fix was submitted internally.  should go live sometime soon.  commit log should read something like "TFLite GPU: Expand how an HWC tensor is read."  I'll close this issue for now; reopen if needed.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
