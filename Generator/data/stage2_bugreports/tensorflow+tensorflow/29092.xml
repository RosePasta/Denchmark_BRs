Sorry if I'm something miss. It's my first attempt to make an issue.

In the :
tensorflow/contrib/cmake/python_modules.txt:
....
tensorflow/contrib/tpu
tensorflow/contrib/tpu/ops   &lt;&lt;&lt; line 435
tensorflow/contrib/tpu/profiler
tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python
...
But this module is not in the directory:

@trialzuki Could you provide more details about the issue and context?

I tried to bild project from commit b211c7a (last release at 28 may 2019) with

Windows 7
Visual Studio 2019
cmake
.. and got build error:
tensorflow/contrib/cmake/tf_python.cmake:217 module tensorflow/contrib/tpu/ops does not exist.

then
checked tensorflow/contrib/cmake/tf_python.cmake ..
checked tensorflow/contrib/cmake/python_modules.txt ..
and found that in tensorflow/contrib/cmake/python_modules.txt:435
notes module tensorflow/contrib/tpu/ops, but there no module "ops" in tensorflow/contrib/tpu, only in
tensorflow/contrib/tpu/python

    Move TPU ops to TF core.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Path tensorflow/contrib/tpu/ops was removed.
I think Jonathan Hseu forgot remove line 217 from tensorflow/contrib/cmake/tf_python.cmake file.
Can I fix it?

Sorry, i still have the problem "CMake Error at tf_python.cmake:217 (message):
Python module not found: tensorflow/contrib/tpu/ops"
and I download the tensorflow-r1.14 from github
Do you have any suggestion about the error? Many thanks for any information.
