	<summary>tf.train.init_from_checkpoint incorrectly raises ValueError</summary>

Describe the current behavior

Train a model.
Add a new variable to the computation graph.
Attempt to initialize the updated graph using tf.train.init_from_checkpoint.
Notice that a ValueError is raised instead of tf.errors.OpError.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File ".../model.py", line 53, in warmup
    tf.train.init_from_checkpoint(self._model_dir, {'/': 'model/'})
  File ".../tensorflow/python/training/checkpoint_utils.py", line 187, in init_from_checkpoint
    _init_from_checkpoint, ckpt_dir_or_file, assignment_map)
  File ".../tensorflow/python/training/distribute.py", line 1053, in merge_call
    return self._merge_call(merge_fn, *args, **kwargs)
  File ".../tensorflow/python/training/distribute.py", line 1061, in _merge_call
    return merge_fn(self._distribution_strategy, *args, **kwargs)
  File ".../tensorflow/python/training/checkpoint_utils.py", line 268, in _init_from_checkpoint
    tensor_name_in_ckpt, ckpt_dir_or_file
ValueError: Tensor params (params in /) is not found in [...] checkpoint
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Documentation for tf.train.init_from_checkpoint states that tf.errors.OpError should be raised. It's unclear if the docs are wrong or the implementation is wrong but I think it's the implementation.

		ValueError is a bit more standard/specific than OpError. Does seem like the docstring should be updated. Can you send a PR?

		Are there any other code paths in tf.train.init_from_checkpoint that could raise tf.errors.OpError? If so, simply updating the docstring doesn't seem like the right answer here. I'll also point out that making the doc change would make it harder to distinguish between two pretty distinct error modes: missing variables in graph vs. missing tensors in checkpoints.

		AFAICT the docstring was never correct. So unless there's a strong use-case for a different exception type I'd say it just needs a docstring update.

		Good to know. I won't be able to make the docstring change but hopefully someone can take this on.

 Created a PR for that.
