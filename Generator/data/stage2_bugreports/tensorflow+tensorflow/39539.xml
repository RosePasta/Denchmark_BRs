I followed the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/hexagon_delegate&gt;TensorFlow Lite Hexagon delegate&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 guide on Oneplus 5. Tensorflow Lite was failed to create Hexagon delegate.

I have downloaded the latest hexagon_nn_skel.run (v1.17) from the page but it still says Failed to fetch Hexagon NN version. This might be because you're using incompatible versions of libhexagon_interface and libhexagon_nn_skel. You must use compatible versions.

Do i need to pull some other so files from somewhere else or my device is not supported.
Thanks
Describe the expected behavior
The DSP delegate should be initialized as my SoC is in the list of supported hardwares.

		Hi


the title has OnePlus5 and in the body you say Pixel 3, can you please confirm which device you are using.


The logcat has "fopen failed for libhexagon_nn_skel.so. (No such file or directory)", please make sure the files are correctly packaged with the app.


please clear you gradle cache to make sure you're pulling the latest nightly and not an old one.


Thanks

1)Thanks a lot for quick response. I used a template from another user and that's why the body had pixel 3. I'm using a oneplus 5.
2)I have placed the directory as mentioned in the above body and as given in the guide. This is my directory structure straight from android studio.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17473554/81971156-451eb300-963e-11ea-931d-c6806368a182.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


I have cleared the gradle cache from ~/.gradle/cache and tried building and running the app again and still the issue persists with the same error log as posted above.

Thanks.

		Few questions/instructions:
In the initialize line for the delegate
(e.g.) hexagonDelegate = new HexagonDelegate(activity);
Can you print
activity.getApplicationInfo().nativeLibraryDir
and check that the shared lib files are on the device under the same path.
adb shell ls -al &lt;PATH_PRINTED_FROM_ABOVE&gt;
If you can paste the results in the reply will be good. Thanks

Hi, thanks for the prompt reply
1)I am using the Kotlin code so hexagonDelegate = new HexagonDelegate(activity); this is initialized like var tflite_hex: Interpreter? = null and then hexagonDelegate = HexagonDelegate(this); finally options.addDelegate(hexagonDelegate)
2) The directory which I'm getting from the activity.getApplicationInfo().nativeLibraryDir is
/data/app/com.example.sr_tflite-wK5_SXPZr9owo3sD9NNzpQ==/lib/arm64 and when I'm running the adb command I'm getting
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;adb shell ls -al /data/app/com.example.sr_tflite-wK5_SXPZr9owo3sD9NNzpQ==/lib/arm64
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 system system 4096 2020-05-15 02:39 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 system system 4096 2020-05-15 02:39 ..
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I see that these so files are not present in that directory? but I have laid them out in correct structure as stated in the documentation.
Thanks

		Hi,
Sorry for the late reply.
You probably have some other changes in your gradle files that impact packaging files.
You can try googling how to package share library in your project (in case you have some advanced gradle files).
If it is packaged correctly and doesn't work feel free to reopen the bug or create new one.
Thanks

Thanks for replying. I tried researching more around this issue and found that maybe the so files which are provided aren't compatible with my phone arch. So I found that you can generate your own so file using the bezel toolkit for dsp delegate using the command bazel build -c opt --config=android_arm64 tensorflow/lite/experimental/delegates/hexagon/java:tensorflow-lite-hexagon
But I'm getting an error

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yuqiu1233&gt;@yuqiu1233&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I didn't get the time to follow up with this issue as I shifted my focus to running models on GPU, but I think you need to run the ./configure script inside the tensorflow repository as provide the location of SDk as well as NDK and bunch of other things. This is how I was able to run things for the GPU. Hope it helps as this is all I know for now.

 Why do you want to build it ? Did you try to use the prebuilt packages - by putting them in your gradle files ?
Can you explain what issues you had ?

 I have generate three .so files by run tflite_hexagon_nn_skel_v1.20.0.0.run, and put these file in app/src/main/jniLibs. the same problem appear with you like this “Failed to fetch Hexagon NN version. This might be because you're using incompatible versions of libhexagon_interface and libhexagon_nn_skel. You must use compatible versions. Refer to Tensorflow Lite Hexagon Delegate Guide.“
Did you solve this problem？

use Snapdragon 855 chip
tensorflow2.1
python3.6

Thanks for you help!
This problem has been solved by pushing that three .so files to this path(activity.getApplicationInfo().nativeLibraryDir)
manually.  The problem now is how to package share library in android project. I will google and try other methods.
I also have another question:
Whether static-sized input must be need for both GPU and DSP accelerate? Is there any way to make the model dynamic input when using GPU or DSP accelerate?
Look forward to your reply

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yuqiu1233&gt;@yuqiu1233&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Hexagon DSP delegate supports dynamic batch size. it's only available now in C API
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/hexagon/hexagon_delegate.h#L25&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/hexagon/hexagon_delegate.h#L25&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and a full example is in this test, this part mainly
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/hexagon/builders/tests/batch_seq_config_test.cc#L105&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/hexagon/builders/tests/batch_seq_config_test.cc#L105&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  thanks for you reply!
I think you may misunderstand me, the dynamic input size doesn't means the batch size number but shape of input image.

 Nope i did understand you. Just saying what is supported at the moment :)

 what a pity it is! It is so meaningful in project that dynamic input with GPU or DSP accelerate. Hoping you can finish that function as soon as possible!
I really appreciate that you have solved the trouble confusing me quite a while!

		I'm using the QNP/SNPE SDK directly but I see the same problem. But I found a solution.
If I set minSdkVersion &lt;= 22, DSP works fine.

And I cannot use the DSP. Only CPU and GPU delegates.
Either this has something to do with the android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs  thing added to Gradle or the way dlopen is handled in sdkVersion &gt;= 23

This release updates the behavior of the dynamic linker. The dynamic linker now understands the difference between a library’s soname and its path ( public bug 6670), and search by soname is now implemented. Apps which previously worked that have bad DT_NEEDED entries (usually absolute paths on the build machine’s file system) may fail when loaded.
The dlopen(3) RTLD_LOCAL flag is now correctly implemented. Note that RTLD_LOCAL is the default, so calls to dlopen(3) that didn’t explicitly use RTLD_LOCAL will be affected (unless your app explicitly used RTLD_GLOBAL). With RTLD_LOCAL, symbols will not be made available to libraries loaded by later calls to dlopen(3) (as opposed to being referenced by DT_NEEDED entries).

 I have the same error log as you. I set  minSdkVersion&lt;= 22 but it still went wrong. I change build.gradle many times, but it didn't work. Android 10, OnePlus 7.Is any other difference you think may be wrong. May Android 10 didn't allow read DSP files? Your reply may be helpful for me. Thanks a lot.

I upgraded my OnePlus 5 to android 10 and I'm unable to access the DSP from then could be that issue. Will suggest to take a look at Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine and run basic examples there on DSP delegate and see if it works.

 Thanks for your reply. I have been working on this problem for a long time. Because I have installed an app I developed that always work well on DSP runtime and AIP runtime. But recently I suddenly found it didn't work. I use that app project in my master's degree paper. Thank you. I try on one SNPE SDK demo ( image-classifiers ), and the same error log happened always. I think it may be some permissions of Android 10 or .so files of system. I tried many solutions that didn't work either.  I also sought help form OnePlus tech. Hope it will help. I decide  to wait for OnePlus's reply. Thanks a lot.

I can say that we contacted Qualcomm regarding this issue and they said that it's upto OEM for locking of DSP. I think it's related to the DSP vulnerability found this year.
I figured out a way to use DSP by rooting my phone and using the selinux policy. This gave me access back to DSP.

 Yeah, I also found the report about the DSP vulnerability. So I always doubt if OnePlus lock it. I tried root my  phone temporarily and run "setenforce 0" , but "adb shell root" didn't work and it showed "Permission denied". Did you mean root the phone permanently? Thanks, you help me  so much.

I haven't tried temporary rooting, I rooted my phone permanently. Using the setenforce command it worked for me 1 time and didn't work for me after the reboot.
