	<summary>tf.image.extract_glimpse does not work as it should (tensorflow 2.1)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 64 bit
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): NVIDIA (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-release-notes)
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1
Python version: 3.6.9

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hello, I am trying to use tf.image.extract_glimpse and I realised that It does not work as it should.
The issue was the same than 4 year ago &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7681&gt;#7681&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it was solved. But It seems like that in the new version of tensorflow 2.1 it is not fixed.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

You can try to reproduce this code:
BATCH_SIZE = 1
IMAGE_HEIGHT = 7
IMAGE_WIDTH = 7
CHANNELS = 1
GLIMPSE_SIZE = (3,3)
image = tf.reshape(tf.range(49, delta=1, dtype=tf.float32),
shape=(BATCH_SIZE, IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, CHANNELS))
output1 = tf.image.extract_glimpse(image, size=GLIMPSE_SIZE,
offsets=[[1,1]], centered=False, normalized=False)
output2 = tf.image.extract_glimpse(image, size=GLIMPSE_SIZE,
offsets=[[2,2]], centered=False, normalized=False)
output1 = [[  0.   1.   2.]
[  5.   6.   7.]
[ 10.  11.  12.]]
output2 =  [[  0.   1.   2.]
[  5.   6.   7.]
[ 10.  11.  12.]]
The results are the same, that we got in issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7681&gt;#7681&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

 I think you are referring to PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/12829&gt;#12829&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		Yes, I am referring to that issue that was solved 4 years ago. But it seems like that for tf 2.1 the error still persist. Am I wrong?

 The PR was merged but seems to have been reverted at one point. Just re-submitted the PR in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/38549&gt;#38549&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It should fix the issue if merged.

		Perfect. So, to solve this issue in my machine, how should I proceed? I installed tf through NVIDIA containers (&lt;denchmark-link:https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tensorflow/tags&gt;https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tensorflow/tags&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Is this change applied automatically? Thank you.

 After the PR is approved and merged, it will show up in tf-nightly automatically (and will show up in the next version of the release, likely TF 2.3.0+ as TF 2.2.0 release is already imminent).
