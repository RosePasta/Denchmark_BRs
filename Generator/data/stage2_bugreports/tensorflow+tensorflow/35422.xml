	<summary>x/Unknown while training the first epoch.</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Code is ran on Google Colab (However, my machine is Windows 10 Version 1903 if that matters)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): No knowledge, using the already installed version on Google Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.1.0-rc1-0-g064e1535a7 2.1.0-rc1
Python version: 3.6.9
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 8.3.0
GPU model and memory: No knowledge, using the given Google Colab hardware.

Describe the current behavior
When fitting the model, on the first epoch, it counts steps like "337/Unknown", the Unknown stays there until the first epoch fitting is over(at step 582) but that issue gets fixed after the first epoch is over. The text turns to "582/582" and it shows like "x/582" on the next epochs.
Describe the expected behavior
It should say like "x/582" at the first epoch too.

Try doing the "Train the model" part. You should encounter this problem when you start fitting the model.

		Uhm, sorry but no, it's still the same. I made sure that I was on version 2.1.0-dev20191226 and it still shows like "x/Unknown"

 Actually, an iterator generates data dynamically. So the length of a dataset iterator is unknown untill you iterate through it. &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52264469/determine-number-of-records-in-tf-data-dataset-tensorflow&gt;This resource&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has more detailed explanation for your question.
You could pass steps_per_epoch argument to the model.fit as shown below. Then, it prints as you are expecting.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; history = model.fit(train_batches,
                    epochs=initial_epochs,steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch,
                    validation_data=validation_batches)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 is the gist for your reference. Thanks!
I am closing this issue as it was resolved. Please feel free to open new issue if you encounter any related issues. Thanks!

		I had the same problem. My guess is this is due to the fact the code was previous version (before 2.x).
Solution: In the fit function, specify batch_size and steps_per_epoch, and it shall work beautifully. At least, worked for me.
