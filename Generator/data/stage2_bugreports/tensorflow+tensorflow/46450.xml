	<summary>unable to load weights from directories other than the working directory</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): linux ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):  binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): tf-nightly-gpu v2.5.0.dev20201214
Python version: 3.8.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA v11.0
GPU model and memory: Tesla T4 15109MiB

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
If i use model.load_weights(dir) and specify a directory similarly to how it's done in the docs:
checkpoint_filepath = "./checkpoints/training_checkpoints_tests/cp.ckpt"
checkpoint_dir = os.path.dirname(checkpoint_filepath)
if os.path.exists(checkpoint_dir):
model.load_weights(checkpoint_filepath)
print('Checkpoints loaded')
else:
!mkdir -p './checkpoints/training_checkpoints_tests'
print('No checkpoints found')
however the script never actually reads into the directory i'm specifying. If i instead load checkpoints directly from the working directory:
checkpoint_filepath = "/training_checkpoints_tests/cp.ckpt"
checkpoint_dir = os.path.dirname(checkpoint_filepath)
if os.path.exists(checkpoint_dir):
model.load_weights(checkpoint_filepath)
print('Checkpoints loaded')
else:
!mkdir -p '/training_checkpoints_tests'
print('No checkpoints found')
it works no problem. This second approach is fine if you have few models or checkpoints, but the direcotry quickly fills with folders and folders of checkpoints of different models and runs and it'd be better to keep all checkpoint in a folder
Describe the expected behavior
load checkpoints from sub-directories

		checkpoint_filepath = "./checkpoints/training_checkpoints_tests/cp.ckpt"
what is the pwd here? Please write the entire path.

There are too many indentation errors, can you please share your code on a colab gist with the error reported.

		While preparing the code to be linked here i think i found the issue
in the docs &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 checkpoint filepaths are specified with double quotes ""
i.e: model.load_weights("pretrained_ckpt")
this is not the correct way to specify filepaths/directories or files in linux, Single quotes '' are to be used
when specifying working directory paths, using double quotes works probably because python handles the paths as entities, while using os.path.exists may not correctly identify paths written inside double quotes.

		i ran a test and loading the checkpoints in a subdirectory, without using os.path.exists, will indeed load the checkpoints
