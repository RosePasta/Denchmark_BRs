		There is a similar issue I found here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/38465&gt;#38465&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. But I am not using the graphics api and I cannot find a solution from that ticket neither.

I ran the code shared, and do not face the same error faced by you. Please find &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/c87c26439e009db172c8408a38d2f5ee/untitled162.ipynb&gt;the gist &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  Sorry for the inconvenience, the old one relies on some files in the directory. I have delete unnecessary code. And here is the new version:
