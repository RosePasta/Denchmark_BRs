	<summary>default installed version of tensorflow lite arduino library is pre-compiled, causing confusing error reports</summary>
	<description>
hiya &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/petewarden&gt;@petewarden&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ive been re-porting my demos (hooray) for Arduino boards
&lt;denchmark-link:https://learn.adafruit.com/tensorflow-lite-for-edgebadge-kit-quickstart&gt;https://learn.adafruit.com/tensorflow-lite-for-edgebadge-kit-quickstart&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

right now when folks install the TensorFlow library it defaults to the pre-compiled version, which causes very obscure errors about register arguments if they are not using the exact same processor.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://learn.adafruit.com/tensorflow-lite-for-edgebadge-kit-quickstart/troubleshooting#uses-vfp-register-arguments-and-libtensorflowlite-dot-a-does-not-error-10-2&gt;https://learn.adafruit.com/tensorflow-lite-for-edgebadge-kit-quickstart/troubleshooting#uses-vfp-register-arguments-and-libtensorflowlite-dot-a-does-not-error-10-2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

please make the default non-pre-compiled...Arduino IDE has a huge collection of supported boards, and as is, will confuse a lot of people :)

		hihi checkin' in on this issue - i saw also SFE bumped into the same issue

NOTE: It is imperative that you install the non-precompiled version of the library. Installing the pre-compiled library will only lead to failure and sadness.

		The Arduino team now have a pending PR which they believe should fix this problem:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/pull/512&gt;arduino/arduino-cli#512&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you take a look and provide feedback? Thanks for your patience!
