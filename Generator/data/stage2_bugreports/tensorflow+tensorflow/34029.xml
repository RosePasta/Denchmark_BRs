	<summary>error on saving RNN layer with recurrent_dropout parameter as saved_model</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;layer_input   = Input(shape=(10, 100)) 
    layer_bi_rnn  = Bidirectional(GRU(units=10,recurrent_dropout=0.2, return_sequences=True))(layer_input)
    layer_dense   = TimeDistributed(Dense(5))(layer_bi_rnn)
    layer_act     = Activation('softmax')(layer_dense)
    model         = Model([layer_input], layer_act)

    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

save this model as saved_model on tf-nightly 2.1.0-dev20191104 raise bug as :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Attempted to save a function b'__inference_forward_lstm_1_layer_call_fn_19037' which references a symbolic Tensor Tensor("dropout/mul_1:0", shape=(None, 256), dtype=float32) that is not a simple constant. This is not supported.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

after trying to change some parameter, i got the conclusion that this issue happens because of recurrent_dropout parameter. Any suggestion?

When tried running the given code for, i got the following error. Kindly find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/oanush/8eda00767d8043f8415d7911c6eee738/34029.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		same error, saving any recurrent model with dropout or recurrent_dropout will raise a error.

 i can save the model just using dropout. would u try?

 I just figure out that if you call

adding dropout or recurrent_dropout will cause a error.
however, if your given file path ended with '.h5', everything works just fine.

 actually i want to save the model as SavedModel. As the tensorflow documentation on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the code is .  I have no problem on saving as the .model of .h5 even with tensorflow only (not using tf-nightly)

 thx. I will give it a try.
I was using tf.keras to build my recurrent network

save model using tf.keras will cause the problem.
I didn't test  method

 There are lots model type we can use to save. This tensor &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load&gt;doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 may help you.

		Can we open this back up? I'm having this same issue and I'm running on a relatively new tensorflow nightly deploy.

		same error! use dropout &amp; recurrent_dropout in GRU, when complete train and use tf.saved_model.save will raise an error. I try to save model directly without train, that will be ok.

 Just make sure the save_path of your model ended with ".h5", which solved my own problem.

		Thanks! but I should save in tf format to use tf serving.
