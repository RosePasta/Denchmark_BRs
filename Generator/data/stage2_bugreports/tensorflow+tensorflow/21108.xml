	<summary>Higher iterations_per_loop values in TPU training lead to NaN gradients!</summary>
	<description>
Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Cloud Platform (Linux Debian)
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.9
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA (TPU)
GPU model and memory: NA (TPU)
Exact command to reproduce:
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am using TPU and my model trains properly with tpu_config=tf.contrib.tpu.TPUConfig(iterations_per_loop=20) but when I increase iterations_per_loop to say 50 or 100, the gradients becomes NaN during the training (see the error below). I consistently see this behavior with higher values of iterations_per_loop while lower values (e.g &lt;20) never lead to NaN gradients.
I tried to set num_shards=1 but the problem is the same.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Gradient for ic_enc/ic_enc_2_ics/logvar/b:0 is NaN : Tensor had NaN values
	 [[Node: CheckNumerics_11 = CheckNumerics[T=DT_FLOAT, message="Gradient for ic_enc/ic_enc_2_ics/logvar/b:0 is NaN", _device="/job:worker/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](Read_13/ReadVariableOp)]]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This question is better asked on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 since it is not a bug or feature request. There is also a larger community that reads questions there.
If you think we've misinterpreted a bug, please comment again with a clear explanation, as well as all of the information requested in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new&gt;issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, including code that can replicate the bug. Thanks!
