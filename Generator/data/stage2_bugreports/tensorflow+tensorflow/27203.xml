	<summary>install page wrong for version 2.0 alpha</summary>
	<description>
on page &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

change "tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0" to "tensorflow==2.0.0-a0"    (two instances)
change "tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-alpha0" to "tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-a0"
change "tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0-gpu" to "tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-a0"
on page &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

change "tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0" to "tensorflow==2.0.0-a0"
i had to make these changes on my ubuntu-18-04 system to get it to install.

		pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-alpha0 and
pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0 work as expected.
I was able to download the wheel and install it successfully.

		you are right, they are both there.  I had tried "tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0-gpu" and when that did not work just went looking around and came across the a0 aliases.
I do believe that that "tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0-gpu" reference is actually wrong, but the others are correct.

		Yes you are right about the tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0-gpu we have to correct it. Thanks!
