	<summary>Image artifact with tf.keras data augmentation</summary>

Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): RUN pip install --upgrade tensorflow tensorflow-gpu
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.3.0-54-gfcc4b966f1 2.3.1
Python version: Python 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: V10.1.243
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 108 / 261MiB / 11178MiB

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
When using the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomFlip('horizontal'),
  tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomRotation(90),
])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I see black lines around the edges of the augmented images. I do not see this when I use plain Keras:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=model_params['rotation_range'],  # randomly rotate images in the range (degrees, 0 to 180)  
    horizontal_flip=model_params['horizontal_flip'],  # randomly flip images
    vertical_flip=model_params['vertical_flip'],

)  
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also, when I upgrade to tf-nightly it goes away.
Describe the expected behavior
I would expect the black lines to not be there.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nRpmyMrXkV43W82nI2fP2F05JndeGdg0?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nRpmyMrXkV43W82nI2fP2F05JndeGdg0?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
I guess my question is whether or not these black lines are truly being fed into the network when using data augmentation.

		Was able to reproduce the issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/32d1f447194b885ef65cbeb2ece787af/44501.ipynb#scrollTo=boucrfpl-SrX&gt;TF v2.3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and as mentioned issue seems to be resolved in the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/2c65092d39820454d5f73e58dd6d63dc/44501-tf-nightly.ipynb#scrollTo=boucrfpl-SrX&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Please find the attached gist. Thanks!

		The fix is available in newly released TF 2.4.0-rc0 as well. Hence we can expect it in TF 2.4 final version as well.
Thanks!

Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ymodak&gt;@ymodak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. And just to clarify, TF 2.4.0 isn't released yet, correct? So should I use tf-nightly in the interim?

		<comment id='4' author='tjdurant' date='2020-11-03T19:25:29Z'>
		That's correct, 2.4.0 is yet to be released. For now you can use 2.4.0-rc0 or latest nightly version (2.5.XXXX)
