	<summary>Request for tflite using Android NDK documentaion</summary>
	<description>
Thank you for submitting a TensorFlow documentation issue. Per our GitHub
policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests, and
build/installation issues on GitHub.
The TensorFlow docs are open source! To get involved, read the documentation
contributor guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue: https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/discuss/sye03udicMI/sDr6MQvIDAAJ&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing): No resources anywhere about tflite usage using Android NDK.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have a .tflite model which involves lots of post processing.
After following &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference#load_and_run_a_model_in_c&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference#load_and_run_a_model_in_c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  I have written the code in cpp and tested on linux and adb shell.
Now I want to use this code in the sample Android apk .(&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
Is there any documentation/sample usage of tflite cpp in Android?
I have only found this(&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zimenglyu/TFLiteExample&gt;https://github.com/zimenglyu/TFLiteExample&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) but not able to follow this :(
Any help would be desperately appreciated.

 Are you raising a PR to update the docs? When you raise a PR, just mention it here so that we will close after it gets merged. Thanks!
