	<summary>Is the task type "master" for distributed training deprecated?</summary>
	<description>
Should task type "master" be immediately replaced with "chief"?
For example, CollectiveAllReduceStrategy only use "chief" (not "master") and "worker":



tensorflow/tensorflow/python/distribute/multi_worker_util.py


        Lines 159 to 161
      in
      36f817a






 # Other jobs such as "ps" shouldn't call this function. 



 if task_type not in ["chief", "worker", "evaluator"]: 



 raise ValueError("Unexpected `task_type` %r" % task_type) 





However, in some environment such as Google Cloud ML Engine, environment variable TF_CONFIG with "master" (not "chief"), "worker", and "ps".
Do you have any plan to keep compatibility?

		Hi, we don't have plans to support "master" job right now. GCP also doesn't have a strong reason to use "master". So for now, we'll stick to "chief".

, this results in a bad experience with AI Platform, since  gets confused about . I would love to see this documented somewhere.
