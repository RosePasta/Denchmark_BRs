&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It's said that tensorflow 2.1.0 is built by bazel 0.26.1, but when I use bazel 0.26.1 to build, I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Please upgrade your bazel installation to version 0.27.1 or higher to build TensorFlow!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, what is the correct bazel version?

		I think there is a mistake in the documentation page. Will send an update for that.
In any case, the true version is the one mentioned in ./configure, giving you the above error. Starting past week, master has Bazelisk set up so you won't have to manually install Bazel anymore, if building from master.

		Worth mentioning that if you plan to use Ubuntu to build TF 2.1 with TensorRT then you might have to still tweak the 2.1 source to allow bazel 0.26.1 as 0.27.1 seems to fail... (See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35115#issuecomment-580860705&gt;#35115 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for details).
Without TensorRT it wouldn't matter, 0.27.1 will be fine.
