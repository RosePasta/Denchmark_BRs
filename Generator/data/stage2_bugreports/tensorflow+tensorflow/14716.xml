###Problem###
My original model is with node "FusedBatchNorm", when I run the script   and 
Everything seems fine, but the result file is empty. And I traced the code, founding that code returned at file 'resolve_constant_binary' 's function 'EvaluateBinaryOperatorOnConstantInputs'.
My model can be get &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.dropbox.com/s/09xivpuboecge56/mobilenet_0.75_0.50_model-388003.zip?dl=0&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
God help me! Thanks a lot!

		It looks like you only provided a checkpoint. Could you provide python source code for the model?
