	<summary>keras ConvLSTM2d not working with eager execution</summary>

TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.13.0-dev20190130
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10/7.4.2.24

Describe the current behavior
While using Eager Execution keras ConvLSTM2D seems like not initialized.
After that we tried implement our model using gradient tape and it seemed fine but after loading checkpoint results was different than expected.
The second issue probably has something in common with the first, so i'm posting code to reproduce first one and logs.
Describe the expected behavior
ConvLSTM2D works with Eager Execution
Code to reproduce the issue
DATA_PATH = 'path/to/directory/with/grayscale/jpg/images"

import os
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Sequential

tf.enable_eager_execution()
filenames = [os.path.join(DATA_PATH, x) for x in sorted(os.listdir(DATA_PATH))]
tf_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(filenames).map(lambda x: tf.image.decode_jpeg(tf.read_file(x), channels=0))
tf_dataset = tf_dataset.batch(10).batch(10)
tf_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.zip((tf_dataset, tf_dataset)).prefetch(tf.contrib.data.AUTOTUNE)

model =  Sequential([
    layers.ConvLSTM2D(filters=3, kernel_size=3, padding='same')
])
model.compile(optimizer=tf.train.AdamOptimizer(), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(tf_dataset)

		I encountered the same preblem in tensorflow-gpu-1.9

		I think the issue should be the fixed by the recent commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/391bee73641f1c23ef90cc40a9e8893f343c30fc&gt;391bee7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can u try the same snippet with tf-nightly and see if it works?

I install  tf-nightly -1.14.1-dev20190304, I re-run the code to find it started wording.
thank you!
