In micro's CONTRIBUTING.md, the path to a script to run tests prior to submitting a PR uses (what is now, at least) an invalid path.



tensorflow/tensorflow/lite/micro/CONTRIBUTING.md


        Lines 204 to 208
      in
      7958e0c






 1.  Run all the tests for x86, and any other platform that you are modifying. 



 



     ``` 



     tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/tools/ci_build/test_x86.sh 



     ``` 





The fix is trivial and on its way.
