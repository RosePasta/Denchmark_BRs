	<summary>[Doc] Are partial batches supported with MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.0
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input#partial_batches

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The release note states

tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy adds support for partial batches.

However the documentation/tutorial states

Currently this is supported for all strategies except tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy.
[...] Partial batches are supported for all strategies except tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy.

This sounds like those contradict each other. What is the actual reality? Can the documentation or the release notes be updated to clarify?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Flamefire&gt;@Flamefire&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for pointing this out. Partial batches are now supported with MWMS. A documentation change has just been submitted and I will update this thread when it goes through.

		Closing this issue now because &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input#partial_batches&gt;documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has been updated to be consistent with the release notes. Thanks again for spotting this one!
