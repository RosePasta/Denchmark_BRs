	<summary>Convert to TFLite Unexpected value for attribute 'data_format'. Expected 'NHWC'</summary>

I'm trying to convert a frozen Tensorflow graph. See model &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=15g1aNF3WdJ7Yw8GRPVEWzBbkaZPIvCGC&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		TF Lite's Conv/MaxPool/AvgPool operator only supports NHWC data format right now. I think your model uses NCHW format in those ops. Could you try switch your data format to 'NHWC'?
		</comment>
		<comment id='2' author='paulbauriegel' date='2019-07-31T08:40:52Z'>
		I would like to switch the data_format, but that is actually not so easy because the model was build in Pytorch-&gt;convert to ONNX-&gt;convert to frozen graph. And I cannot change the data format of a node without rebuilding the entire graph. Is there some tool from Tensorflow to do that?
		</comment>
		<comment id='3' author='paulbauriegel' date='2019-07-31T18:25:07Z'>
		There isn't such tool that I'm aware of to convert data format from a graphdef. One way to do this is to manually insert transpose nodes before each of those ops in your graphdef(which could be tricky).

 Ok, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/paulbauriegel/tensorflow-tools/blob/master/convert-model-to-NWHC.py&gt;modifying the GraphDef&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and adding Transpose nodes before and after the convolutional operations let me convert the model. Thanks for the hint

hi, currently we don't have concrete plans to support it on our roadmap. Sorry about that. If you can share some common scripts that could help walk-around this issue, that will be great. thanks!

@haozha111 Ok, modifying the GraphDef and adding Transpose nodes before and after the convolutional operations let me convert the model. Thanks for the hint +1

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/paulbauriegel&gt;@paulbauriegel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Could you please elaborate on how to do that? I have the exact same issue, but I am not sure where to put the transpose and how to modify the GraphDef. Thank you very much!

		Thanks for the quick response! I hadn't noticed the link (it points to the wrong url!), I have now tried it, and it gives me an error on the first node processed:

It seemed that the order of the strides channels was not the right one for me. After this change, I managed to convert to NHWC with no problem.
Hope it helps!

Ha ha I just figure out something like that right now even not reading your post)))
Did you convert you model to TFlite. I cant do it even with resnet18 got something like
Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: Dilation2D
Which is completly weird because resnet18 does not have any dilations in convs

 Yes, forgot to transfer the attributes for the Conv2D layer. I added the fix to the script. As for the  error look at the solution from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/38102&gt;#38102&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 maybe that helps:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS,

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow/issues/595&gt;This issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 leading to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow/pull/613&gt;this fix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 might help you, It's an issue when converting to TFlite,  as ONNX -&gt; Frozen pb graph incorporates Dilation2D layer, even when dilations are 1 (by default dilations are 1 in Conv layers)

I use your script and get a pb file,but i convert pb to tflite file get a error like this:

 Hard to say without having a closer look at your model. You can open a issue in my Repo and we can continue the discussion there.
