	<summary>Possibly outdated docs on iOS selective registration</summary>
	<description>
The documentation at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c941c087a9dfd5b27eff00ead928c9ee208e9a35/tensorflow/examples/ios/README.md#reducing-the-binary-size&gt;tensorflow/examples/ios/README.md #reducing-the-binary-size&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 features the following (two-year-old) snippet:

After that, you can manually look at modifying the list of kernels included in tensorflow/contrib/makefile/tf_op_files.txt to reduce the number of implementations to the ones you're actually using in your own model. We're hoping to automate this step in the future, but for now manually removing them is the best approach.

Today, selective registration uses  and commit
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c4ef927b5eaf144dbf1e0419c0d1d3fd968177bd&gt;c4ef927&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 introduced the  option in  which automates its creation.
I think the documentation (and possibly tooling) for iOS selective registration need to be updated.

		Thanks for the report.

, you seem to know a thing or two about this new setup I could approve a docs-update PR if you send one.
It may be hard to find people to help with this given that the old tf-mobile set up is getting deprecated in favor of TFLite. Ref:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/164099ee4688432d614c754b1e01d56715811062&gt;164099e&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gargn&gt;@gargn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can advise. Who's the right person to update this doc?

		Not sure. I'm guessing either &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/miaout17&gt;@miaout17&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/petewarden&gt;@petewarden&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 might have some context. I added both of them to this bug.

		 links to  which has an (up-to-date) "Optimization" section. In the iOS "Reducing the binary size" section, I'd replace the offending text with a hint to that section. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/21521&gt;#21521&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I'm not familiar with TF Mobile selective registration.
I think the readme change make sense.
