	<summary>Quantization code in different path to where specified in Help Documentation</summary>
	<description>
Following the documentation here to Quantize - &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/how_tos/quantization/index.html&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/how_tos/quantization/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

seems to be wrong.
I had to change
bazel build tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools:quantize_graph bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/quantization/tools/quantize_graph \ --input=/tmp/classify_image_graph_def.pb \ --output_node_names="softmax" --output=/tmp/quantized_graph.pb \ --mode=eightbit
TO
bazel build tensorflow/tools/quantization/quantize_graph bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/quantization/quantize_graph \ --input=/tmp/classify_image_graph_def.pb \ --output_node_names="softmax" --output=/tmp/quantized_graph.pb \ --mode=eightbit 
ie it seems like it's moved from tensorflow/contrib to tensorflow/tools/
