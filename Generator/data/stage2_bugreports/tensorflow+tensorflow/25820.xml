		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dynamicwebpaige&gt;@dynamicwebpaige&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Sorry, this is my first contribution to TensorFlow. Should I wait for a person to review this issue before working on this, or can I go ahead and send a PR? I got a bit confused with the label.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dynamicwebpaige&gt;@dynamicwebpaige&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is this issue still open? I wrote two books on TensorFlow and I am happy to help with the documentation... I teach deep learning at the university and maybe I can help with doc issues... Let me know. I noticed that some material has been added already.
