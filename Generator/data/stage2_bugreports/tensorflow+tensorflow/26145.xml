	<summary>Tensorflow 1.13 - can't deprecate tf.layers.conv2d - no existing replacement</summary>
	<description>
I'm updating to Tensorflow 1.13 from 1.12.
tf.layers.conv2d is being deprecated.
The note states:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;conv2d (from tensorflow.python.layers.convolutional) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use keras.layers.conv2d instead.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

First, there is no 'keras.layers.conv2d'.  This is a 'keras.layers.Conv2D', but that is a different function and a direct replacement for 'tf.layers.Conv2D'.
Therefore, either make a 'keras.layers.conv2d' function or remove the deprecation warning for 'tf.layers.conv2d'.
Here's the link to the conv2d fuction.

Thanks,

		I am in the same situation. I want a functional API, is that going away for good?

		Same here!

		We are consolidating the high level APIs and remove duplications. Under the hood, tf.conv2d is using exactly the same code as tf.keras.layers.Conv2D. The functional API is just a wrapper around the keras API. With the new keras layer API, the existing tf.conv2d can be rewrite as follow:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Old functional API
output = tf.conv2d(inputs, *other_args)

# New OO API
output = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(*other_args)(inputs)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 can you simply update the documentation and warning one gets?
The current documentation is wrong. It leads users to a non-existing function. The documentation should simply state what you just wrote above.
Thanks

		Its actually been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a4f5558529a56d72bdcec9c0c8d0a3fb2a91fb64&gt;a4f5558&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but hasn't reach the stable release yet.
