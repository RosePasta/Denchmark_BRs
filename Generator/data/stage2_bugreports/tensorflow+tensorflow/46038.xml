After installing tensorflow2.4rc4 version on windows10, cudnn initialization error appears when running the training code.

tensorflow version:  tensorflow 2.4.0rc4

Please try setting a hard limit on the total GPU memory as shown in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu#limiting_gpu_memory_growth&gt;this guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and check if it helps.

		I tried to limit the hard limit on the total GPU memory many times, but still not fixed this issue, but use tf-nightly==2.5.0,  it's not this issue, but tf-nightly==2.5.0 can't use activation='tanh' in the Conv2D function. if use activation='tanh' in Conv2D, then the tranning process will crash. BTW, I try to use CUDA11.0 + cudnn-10.2-windows10-x64-v8.0.5.39, the tensorfow==2.4.0rc4 have not this issue(Could not create cudnn handle: CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED...), but if use Conv2D, then will be no gradient drop during training.

		I use the follow set GPU memory code let it can not show this issue. (use  tensorflow2.4.0rc4 + CUDA11.0 + cudnn-11.0-windows-x64-v8.0.4.30)
config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.per_process_gpu_memory_fraction = 0.4
session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)
but there will be no gradient drop during training when use Conv2D.

		use tf-nightly==2.5.0, gradient drop is normal during training when use Conv2D, but can't use activation='tanh' in the Conv2D function,  the traning process will be crash

		I did also run into the issue:
2021-01-03 18:22:53.254748: E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:336] Could not create cudnn handle: CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED

However, after rebooting Windows it worked fine, only with the second run after the reboot I got the error. I downgraded from TF 2.4.0 to 2.3.0, which resolved this issue for me.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?
