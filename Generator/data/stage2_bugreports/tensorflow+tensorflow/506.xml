	<summary>ptb_word_lm.py error: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'Tensor' and 'int'</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I ran the ptb_word_lm example from models/rnn/ptb. however I got the unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'Tensor' and 'int' for line 139 in ptb_word_lm.py.
I also managed to fix it, by changing
139 self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / batch_size
to
139 self._cost = cost = tf.div(tf.reduce_sum(loss), tf.constant(batch_size, dtype=tf.types.float32))
And it works fine so far.

		Thanks for letting us know about this. Could you tell me whether you're using Python 2 or 3? (Although we're using from __future__ import division, this smacks of a Python 3 compatibility issue....)

		I'm using 2.7, however when I commented out the from __future__ import division the original code worked fine. So it is some "v3" trickery.

		This may be a 'feature' -- tensors are intentionally rather strict about
implicit conversions, so I think they don't have olddiv. Try casting
the int to a float.

		Attempt 1:
from __future__ import division
self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / float(batch_size)

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'Tensor' and 'float'

Attempt 2. maybe numpy?
from __future__ import division
self._cost = cost = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / np.array(batch_size, dtype=np.float32)

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'Tensor' and 'float'

With from __future__ import division just the way in the original issue I wrote seems to work.

 you got it :)
First I got AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__version__'
After updating to 0.6.0 , the original code works fine. My bad, sorry for the mistake guys!
