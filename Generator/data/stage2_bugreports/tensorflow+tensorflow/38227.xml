	<summary>train_speech_model.ipynb TUTORIAL with colab not working</summary>

@tensorflow/micro
System information

Host OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Tensorflow version (commit SHA if source):
Target platform (e.g. Arm Mbed OS, Arduino Nano 33 etc.):

Describe the problem
I am trying to use this to train a set, the base tutorial will not compile the train.py section. I am copying and pasting the commands to colab to test and get a MODULE NOT FOUND ERROR.
I have used this in the past about a month or so ago and it worked fine. Something must have been changed recently to cause this issue.
Here is the output I get when trying to run the "Begin Training" section:
2020-04-04 20:08:28.890032: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:44] Successfully opened dynamic library libcudart.so.10.1
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "/content/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/input_data.py", line 35, in

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.contrib'
Please provide the exact sequence of commands/steps when you ran into the problem

		I found that line 35 in /content/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/input_data.py is no the same using the git in the instructions of the tutorial. I changed it manually to match what is currently in the git hub and it compiles further but is still having issues finding "contrib_audio"

  Currently, Tf-nightly-gpu version is 2.2.0.dev20200405, For additional information please refer this &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly-gpu/&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
To install tf 1.15, try pip install tensorflow==1.15. Thanks!

		TF nightly installs TF 2.x version and contrib module is no longer part of TF from 2.X.
Also we don't save pipy packages of older tf nightly versions such as 1.15.0.dev20190729
You can try using stable TF 1.x versions for using contrib module.
Thanks!

		I have be able to get version 1.x to complete but the tensor board doesn't
work anymore. It makes it difficult to gauge progress. Can you try and run
it on version 1 and see if tensor board works for you?

		If you can open a new issue and explain the tensorboard problem perhaps we can take a look and assist you. Reason being, we want to keep one issue thread specific to one topic so that it helps for users referring it in future. Thanks!
