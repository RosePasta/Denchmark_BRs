	<summary>tf.pad does not support SparseTensor in r1.0</summary>
	<description>
This works
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
session = tf.InteractiveSession()
pad = tf.pad([[1,2]], [[0,0],[0,150]], mode='CONSTANT')
pad.eval()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But this doesn't work
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
session = tf.InteractiveSession()
tensor = tf.SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 0], [0, 1]], values=[1, 2], dense_shape=[1, 2])
pad = tf.pad(tensor, [[0,0],[0,150]], mode='CONSTANT')
pad.eval()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The following error is thrown
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/Users/sromano/Dropbox/uba/tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/array_ops.py", line 1646, in pad

    raise err
TypeError: Expected binary or unicode string, got &lt;tensorflow.python.framework.sparse_tensor.SparseTensor object at 0x116288450&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My use case is that I'm reading a csv file where each row has a different amount of elements and I want to turn it into a matrix of a fixed length. I use string split in each row and I get a SparseTensor, so then I need a different padding in each row to complete the expected width.
I'm using Python 2.7 and Tensorflow r1.0

		Did this work for you  previously?

		No. I updated from r0.10 to r1.0 to see if it will get solved. But it did not work in any of the two versions

		Yes, unfortunately, it is difficult to support every operation for sparse tensors, and currently it is only supported by a few special ops. With the current sparse form this is unlikely to be a super efficient operation, since to produce paded values, you'd need random access to access values for a gather based approach to producing padded values. It's definitely possible, but we haven't found a need for it yet. What is your use case. Would you be willing to work on a PR to add support?
Thanks for posting this issue!
