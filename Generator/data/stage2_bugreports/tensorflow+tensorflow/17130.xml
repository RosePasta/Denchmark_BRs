	<summary>Java: SIGSEGV when `Tensors.create`-ing from an uninitialized array</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
macOS 10.13.3
JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_121-b13) (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): maven

    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.tensorflow&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;tensorflow&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.4.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;

TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.4.0
Python version: N/A
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce:

    // JUnit test case
    public void testSigSegv() {
        byte[][] bb = new byte[3][];  // note: new byte[3][1] doesn't crash, presumably it is initialized by the compile

        bb[0] = new byte[] { 0 };
        bb[1] = new byte[] { 1 };
        // no bb[2]

        // next line sigsegv's
        Tensors.create(bb);
    }
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using Tensors.create to get a Tensor&lt;String&gt; from an uninitialized 2D byte array (byte[][]) results in a SIGSEGV from JNI. See full log below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running the above test case, I get the following output.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x000000010571f0b3, pid=30179, tid=0x0000000000001a03
#
# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_121-b13) (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.121-b13 mixed mode bsd-amd64 compressed oops)
# Problematic frame:

#
# If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit:

#

Process finished with exit code 134 (interrupted by signal 6: SIGABRT)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm not familiar enough with JNI in general to know if I'm expecting too much. I won't be surprised if you mark this wontfix, I was just surprised to be able to crash the process with a segfault given some bad data. Easy enough to work around (I will size/init my arrays more carefully) but thought you might want to know.
Cheers! Thanks so much for this library!

		Thanks very much for the report! Yes, this is indeed a bug (it should not be possible to cause the JVM to segfault when using the Java API :).
Will send a fix shortly.
