Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Here is some code:
class MultiHeadAttention(keras.layers.Layer):
def init(self, d_model, num_heads):
super(MultiHeadAttention, self).init()
self.num_heads = num_heads
self.d_model = d_model
assert self.d_model%self.num_heads == 0
self.depth = self.d_model // self.num_heads
self.WQ = keras.layers.Dense(self.d_model)
self.WK = keras.layers.Dense(self.d_model)
self.WV = keras.layers.Dense(self.d_model)
self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(self.d_model)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def call(self,q,k,v,mask):
    batch_size = tf.shape(q)[0]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jacketchan&gt;@jacketchan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

could you please check the gast version. Tensorflow 2.x supports gast ==0.2.2.
let us know if that helps,Thanks!
