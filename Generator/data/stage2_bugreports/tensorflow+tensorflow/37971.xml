	<summary>Broken link for tf.debugging.assert_same_float_dtype</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/index.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/index.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The link for tf.debugging.assert_same_float_dtype is dead
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The previous link leads to: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/assert_same_float_dtype&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/assert_same_float_dtype&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The new link must be:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/assert_same_float_dtype.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/assert_same_float_dtype.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(The .md file extension is missing in the link)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Yes, will be updating the issue soon enough

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/theadityasam&gt;@theadityasam&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I just checked &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/index.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/index.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , let's call that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0/site/en/api_docs/python/index.md&gt;index&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and none of the links work. It's not only for , they do however work when I append  at the end. I guess this means a complete modification of the contents of the file .
Please update your title as well as per the issue.

		Is it okay if I look into this instead? Should be pretty easy for me.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Rubix982&gt;@Rubix982&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Sure, work on the issue. I saw your PR, from what I gather, the index.md is generated by some script and I guess it's not as simple as adding .md to the url's(not really sure about that, need to ask the code owners once). Also, I believe the API docs were moved to the TF website and were deprecated in the previous versions.
