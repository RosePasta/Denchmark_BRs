	<summary>normalization in cosine similarity</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The documentation for the cosine similarity does not state whether y_true and y_pred
are expected to be normalized vectors. The provided equation loss = -sum(y_true * y_pred)
suggests the need to be, but looking at the source, they are normalized as part of the computation.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;y_true = nn.l2_normalize(y_true, axis=axis)
y_pred = nn.l2_normalize(y_pred, axis=axis)
return -math_ops.reduce_sum(y_true * y_pred, axis=axis)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As a special case, the doc does not state what happens in the case of either being zero.
(Also, isn't the above implementation suboptimal in terms of speed, as each element is divided by
the norm, instead of simply dividing the result once?)

		Yes, can you send a PR?
The code is here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/losses.py#L1097-L1141&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/losses.py#L1097-L1141&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you make a PR please use &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html&gt;doctest format&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, for example code so that it is testable (prefix code lines with ).

		I think this could be closed since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/37090&gt;#37090&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is merged ?

 Thanks for the note. I am closing this issue as the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/37090&gt;#37090&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 related to this issue already merged. Thanks!

		The documentation is still lacking for the  class, and contains a sign error.
I have submittd &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/37343&gt;#37343&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for that.
