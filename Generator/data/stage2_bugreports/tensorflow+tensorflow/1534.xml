What could be wrong with my gpu setting?

		This still happens on latest code, it seems that it tries to create the same device multiple times. Under gdb I found that multiple threads are calling BaseGPUDeviceFactory::CreateDevices simultaneously. Is this the desired behaviour?

		Hmm, this is probably wrong (we at one point had GPU devices created statically once per process).  I'll try to get a fix for this at some point soon.

		The error turned out to be caused by my GPU setting (one user of the machine had set the compute_mode to be EXCLUSIVE_THREAD). This concurrent behaviour seems to cause no harm.

		Ahh, good to know!  I had seen a report of this before and thought we were doing something wrong.  Glad to hear it's supposed to work in this fashion too :)
