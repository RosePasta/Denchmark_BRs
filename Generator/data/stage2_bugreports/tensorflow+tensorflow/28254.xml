Adding these lines in the main file running the model, worked like charm for me.

Glad my solution helped you.
You could add these lines at the top of your main script file and run your python file in the command line too with python filename.py
or you could bash script these lines in your bash rc file. You can search it on google, how to add and run script in the bash file. But I wouldn't recommend that as it might unnecessarily acquire your GPU resource.
