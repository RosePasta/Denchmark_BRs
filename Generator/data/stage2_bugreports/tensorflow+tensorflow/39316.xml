Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip install
TensorFlow version (use command below): tensorflow-gpu 2.2.0 and 2.1.0
Python version:python3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:10.1
GPU model and memory:8g

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"
my code is:

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;-- coding: utf-8 --&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow import feature_column
from tensorflow.keras.experimental import SequenceFeatures
volume = feature_column.sequence_numeric_column('volume')
lstm_columns = [volume]
features = tf.io.parse_example(..., features=feature_column.make_parse_example_spec(lstm_columns))
sequence_feature_layer = SequenceFeatures(lstm_columns) #返回特征列的长度和 tensor
sequence_input, sequence_length = sequence_feature_layer(features)
Describe the current behavior
Traceback (most recent call last):

'Given: {}'.format(column))
ValueError: All feature_columns must be _FeatureColumn instances. Given: SequenceNumericColumn(key='volume', shape=(1,), default_value=0.0, dtype=tf.float32, normalizer_fn=None)
it looks like a bug ? can you fix it?
Describe the expected behavior

I solved the problem by reinstalling tensorflow, but another problem bothered me. The cases in the official tensorflow documentation are as follows:
dnn_activation='relu'
volume = tf.feature_column.numeric_column('volume', shape=number_shape)
l_list=[volume]
features = tf.io.parse_example(
serialized=record, features=tf.feature_column.make_parse_example_spec(l_list))
input_l=keras.layers.DenseFeatures(l_list)
dnn1=keras.layers.Dense(300,activation=dnn_activation)(input_l)
output=keras.layers.Dense(1,activation='tanh')(dnn1)
model = Model(inputs = [input_l],outputs = [output])
model.compile(loss = "mae",optimizer = "Adam")
I tried to input the feature column to keras model, but the code features = tf.io.parse_example (
serialized = record, features = tf.feature_column.make_parse_example_spec (l_list))
In the case of serialized = record, what type of object should be filled here to complete parse_example? I studied the official API carefully, but the official API filled in serialized = ... instead. I can't understand how to complete the code. I tried to fill in various methods such as tfrecord, fill in tensor, and I couldn't complete the code. My data is a csv file. Can you provide a complete example, including data reading, feature column processing, and training?? I really cannot complete the code. Thank you very much, this is very important to me. Thank you very much, my email: &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:402868327@qq.com&gt;402868327@qq.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
