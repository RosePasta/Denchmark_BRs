System information

OS: Windows 10 18362
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): sourece
TensorFlow version (use command below):  v2.0.0-rc2-26-g64c3d382ca 2.0.0
Python version: python 3.68

Describe the current behavior
The func read() does not work (it return noting) and terminates my program.
Describe the expected behavior
In the doc, read() shoud return the contents of the file as string
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf 
image = tf.io.gfile.GFile(r"..\datasets\icdar2015\img_1.jpg", 'r')
image.read()
My TF2.0 version below has the same problem with the beyond.
image_data = tf.io.gfile.GFile(os.path.abspath(path), 'rb').read()
My TF1.x version below run well
image_data = tf.gfile.FastGFile(os.path.abspath(path), 'rb').read()

@Jinof, I tried replicating the issue with Tf 2.0.0 but it worked as expected. tf.io.gfile.GFile(path).read() returns the content of the file as string. Please refer this link. Thanks

Yeah i have made it.My program does have some problem.What puzzles me is my TF2.0 version quit without reporting any error but my TF1.X version report my errors correctly.
It interesting that arfter restarting my computer both of them work well.And the error info can be reported by TF2.0 correctly.
