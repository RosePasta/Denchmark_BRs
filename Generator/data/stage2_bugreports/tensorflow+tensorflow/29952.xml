	<summary>Error when using tf.keras.backend.function() in 1.14.0-rc0/1.14.0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def input_derivative(model, x, goal):
  """ Calculate derivatives wrt the intputs """
  y_true = Input(shape=(10,))
  ce = categorical_crossentropy(y_true, model.output)
  grad_ce = tf.keras.backend.gradients(ce, model.inputs)
  func = tf.keras.backend.function(model.inputs + [y_true], grad_ce)
  output = func([x, goal])
  return output
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Here is my code try to calculate gradients.
It is work in tensorflow1.13.1
but get error message at tensorflow1.14.0-rc0 like the following
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InvalidArgumentError: 2 root error(s) found.
  (0) Invalid argument: Expected size[0] in [0, 0], but got 1
	 [[{{node softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits/Slice_1}}]]
	 [[gradients/conv2d/Conv2D_grad/Conv2DBackpropInput/_101]]
  (1) Invalid argument: Expected size[0] in [0, 0], but got 1
	 [[{{node softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits/Slice_1}}]]
0 successful operations.
0 derived errors ignored.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture).  Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the exact code snippet to reproduce the issue included in your test case. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;the Github new issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!
