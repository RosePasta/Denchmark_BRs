Describe the current behavior
When I trying to remove training node with the function tf.graph_util.remove_training_nodes, a Identity node named "FeatureExtractor/MobilenetV2/expanded_conv_13/expansion_output
" is not removed.

I tried this in Python2 and there is no such issue. Could you look into it?

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
You can get the model from &lt;denchmark-link:http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz&gt;http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After untar, you'll see ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.pb.
import tensorflow as tf
input_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
with open("ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.pb", "rb") as f:
    input_graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
    out_graph_def = tf..graph_util.remove_training_nodes(input_graph_def)
    tf.io.write_graph(out_graph_def, "./", "fused.pb", as_text=False)
Then you can review it in &lt;denchmark-link:https://lutzroeder.github.io/netron/&gt;https://lutzroeder.github.io/netron/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		I was able to reproduce the behavior using TF 1.15.2
However unfortunately &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/graph_util/import_graph_def&gt;tf.graph_util.remove_training_nodes&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is deprecated and no longer part of TF 2.
