Hi,
I am trying to use ScipyOptimizerInterface() in the tensorflow, but it gave the following attribute error
AttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute 'compat'.
By going through the discussion threads at Tensorflow github page, I have upgarded "dask", downgraded pandas, reinstalled tensorflow and scipy packages. Unfortunately, it is still giving me same AttributeError. Does anyone having similar issues and can help me to resolve it? I can use tensorflow normally for other minimizations algorithms (tested ADAMS) but for scipy's BFGS implementation, I am getting this attribute error.
I am running code on Linux Centos system with python 3.6 and tensorflow 1.12.0. Version for pandas is 0.24.0. I tried to downgrade the pandas to 0.19.2 but it broke other parts of my code which use f2py library.
Any thoughts on how to fix this issue?

		I have just solved this problem. I had a similar issue, It may be a problem caused by package conflicts.  .You can try this in your console:
conda upgrade --all -y
This command above can solve the following two questions.
Issue 1：
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "/Users/hyg/soft/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/__init__.py", line 42, in &lt;module&gt; from pandas.core.api import * File "/Users/hyg/soft/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/api.py", line 26, in &lt;module&gt; from pandas.core.groupby import Grouper File "/Users/hyg/soft/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/__init__.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import GroupBy  # noqa: F401 File "/Users/hyg/soft/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py", line 20, in &lt;module&gt; import pandas.compat as compat AttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute 'compat'

		Thanks for your reply. I updated the conda as per your suggestion. I am having the following error now
AttributeError: type object 'scipy.interpolate.interpnd.array' has no attribute 'reduce_cython'

		Thank you for your post. We noticed you have not filled out the fields in the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new?template=10-build-installation-issue.md&gt;template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Could you update them if they are relevant in your case, or leave them as N/A? Along with the template, please provide as many details as possible to find the root cause of the issue. Are you getting the error during installation or during running some code. It would be great if you can provide a small code to reproduce the error. Thanks!

		For 0.25,0.24,0.23, as in doc
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Warning

The pandas.core, pandas.compat, and pandas.util top-level modules are PRIVATE. Stable functionality in such modules is not guaranteed. 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

as in 0.23
&lt;denchmark-link:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23/api.html?highlight=compat&gt;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23/api.html?highlight=compat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

update: downgrade to 0.23 works for me too, thx!
and in 0.24

and in stable(Now 0.25)

		In my case, this error was caused my mixing package installations via pip and conda. In my case, I had installed pandas via pip by mistake, while using conda as a main package manager.
To check use:
conda list
If the Channel of a package is "pypi", it was installed via pip.
The solution was:
pip uninstall pandas
conda install pandas

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hongyonggan&gt;@hongyonggan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , after upgrading conda it works fine.
