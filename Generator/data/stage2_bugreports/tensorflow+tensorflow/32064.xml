	<summary>Installers for C-API do not include copyright/license information for Tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
System information


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Windows, Linux and OSX


Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
N/A


TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
Binary, using the instructions from C-API page at:
(https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c)


TensorFlow version:
1.14.0


Python version:
N/A


Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?:
Installed by following instructions at C-API page (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c)
, basically extracting from tarball or zip file.


Bazel version (if compiling from source):
N/A


GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
N/A


CUDA/cuDNN version:
N/A


GPU model and memory:
N/A


Describe the problem
The problem I see is that there is no COPYRIGHT or LICENSE information for the TENSORFLOW library itself. There is a LICENSE file under \include\tensorflow\c\LICENSE, but that gives all of the LICENSE information for the 3rd party libraries that tensorflow uses, but there is nothing for tensorflow itself.
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem
Windows:
Unzip the zip file
LINUX/Darwin
Detar the compressed tarballs
Any other info / logs
None

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gadagashwini&gt;@gadagashwini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Yes I believe that would be correct. However, I'm not a TF dev. The installers typically have the licensing information included with the installation. This is actually the first one I've encountered that does not.
Thank you.

, You can get the Tensorflow license info by using the command  . Please take a look at screenshot below. Thanks!

		Thank you for the workaround &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gadagashwini&gt;@gadagashwini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . This will work for folks that have PIP, python, etc. installed. We are using the C-API, Binary distribution specifically because we don't want/need, all of that underlying stuff that we don't actually need. We just use the Binaries.
We are trying to ensure that we follow appropriate licensing requests/guidelines. However, the distribution for the C-API binaries does not have any licensing information for Tensorflow itself included in it. So technically those distros could be viewed as unlicensed.
I'm pointing out an enhancement that should be made to those binary distributions so that the Tensorflow products and licenses are protected.
Thank you for your consideration.

		Thank you very much for reporting this.
You are correct, the license file was missing in some of the distributables.
The fixes are merged into master. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/32852&gt;#32852&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will fix this in 2.0 branch. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/32853&gt;#32853&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will fix this in 1.15 branch. We will push new binaries with the fixes within 1 week.
