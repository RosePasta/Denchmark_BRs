	<summary>keras.utils.Sequence instance can't be deleted from memory after training</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Windows 10 x64
TensorFlow version (use command below):2.3.1
Python version: 3.8
CUDA/cuDNN : 10.1, 7.6.5
GPU model and memory:

Describe the current behavior
I have created a custom class that inherits from keras.utils.Sequence
This class is reading some images with opencv into memory when constructed
If i just instantiate this class and after this i call
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import gc

myObj = Myclass(imgpaths)
del myObj
gc.colect()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

everything is ok, but, if i am creating an instance + performing training:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import gc

train= Myclass(imgpaths)
validation= Myclass(imgpaths)

model = MyCustomModel()#i just used the pretrained Xception with 2 custom layers at the top for my case
model.fit(train, validation,...)
del train
del validation
gc.collect()
#...
#here i am doing other things
#...

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

then i can see that memory is not freed when calling gc.collect() and is freed only when the process is stopped
Describe the expected behavior
model should free the Sequence class passed to it when training is finished
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
#create a simple Sequence instance that is reading some images when constructed
#create an Xception model and call fit() with that sequence
#import gc, call del train_sequence, call gc.collect()
#create a for loop so that you will be able to see that memory is not freed (for i in range(1,999999999999999999): a=5)
#inspect RAM consumption and observe that RAM use is not decreasing after gc.collect(), meaning that keras model stores internally a reference of the Sequence object and it is not allowing to free the memory

		Please can you share a very minimal buy runnable standalone example or Colab?

Is this still an issue.

 , yes, but i don't have time to provide an (minimal) example now. So, i'll close this issue and will re-open when i'll have time for an example in Colab
