	<summary>Cannot load saved model when using multiple tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.StringLookup layers</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 20.04.1 and Colab
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.1
Python version: 3.8.5 (Ubuntu) and 3.6.9 (Colab)
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A

v2.3.0-54-gfcc4b966f1 2.3.1
Describe the current behavior
I am unable to load a saved model that has multiple tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.StringLookup layers.
When I load the model, I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: The same saveable will be restored with two names: layer_with_weights-1/_table/.ATTRIBUTES/table
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
I expect to be able to load the model.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BrlOjxYVyVM3lEJRmeK9lNvev8Z4MVwT?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BrlOjxYVyVM3lEJRmeK9lNvev8Z4MVwT?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The notebook does the following:

Create a model with two tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.StringLookup layers.
Save the model with tf.saved_model.save in the same Keras model
Reload the model with tf.saved_model.load
ValueError is thrown

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to

It works when using a single StringLookup layer.
I have observed the same problem with tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.TextVectorization.

		I tried your code with the latest tf-nightly, and it works perfectly. I also tried with tensorflow==2.4.0rc4 and also works. I would suggest upgrading your TensorFlow version.

 thanks for the quick response! This is great news, and I am a bit embarrassed that I did not try the release candidate before posting. I will close the issue and upgrade to the bleeding edge  Thank you for your time.
(I have verified now that it worked for my use case in 2.4.0 RC4)
