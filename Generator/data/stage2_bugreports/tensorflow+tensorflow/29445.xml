Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No. this is a stock example, see collab notebook here to reproduce
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O8dCWeYBVjFEax-ZK1XbJE_vfEzB2Ieq
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:

TensorFlow version (use command below): '2.0.0-dev20190605'
Python version:
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: Collab

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0:

		I was able to reproduce the issue on Colab (GPU) with TF 2.0.0-dev20190610 but the code ran fine on TF 2.0.0-alpha0.
