		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/leimao&gt;@leimao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Just to verify, your CUDA version is 10.0 and cuDNN version is 7. Thanks!

		<comment id='2' author='leimao' date='2019-06-28T15:25:34Z'>
		Note that I was using your official container. My local environment is CUDA 10.1 and I did not install cuDNN.

 Per &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/29632&gt;#29632&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this does not look like an issue directly related to the Docker images, since it's failing alongside the official installation instructions as well.

		Is this problem related?

		Have you tried &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/using_gpu#limiting_gpu_memory_growth&gt;Limiting GPU memory growth&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 option?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/config/experimental/set_memory_growth&gt;tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		<comment id='7' author='leimao' date='2019-07-03T19:12:55Z'>
		I used some magic code which some other people have mentioned:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.compat.v1 import ConfigProto
from tensorflow.compat.v1 import InteractiveSession
config = ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = InteractiveSession(config=config)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Somehow it worked and the code looks similar to yours. However I don't like the code since it does not make sense to me and there is session in the code. (TF 2.0 has no sessions!) I have a very small model (3 layers of conv) and running on 2080 TI, I don't think GPU memory is an issue here.

		<comment id='8' author='leimao' date='2019-07-03T19:13:26Z'>
		Can you please justify why I should use the above code (either yours or the ones I mentioned)?

		<comment id='9' author='leimao' date='2019-07-03T19:14:30Z'>
		This cuDNN open problem seems to be universal for both TF 1.x and 2.0.
