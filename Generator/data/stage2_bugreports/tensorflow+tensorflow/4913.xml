 thanks for pointing to the updated &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4852&gt;#4852&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, I'm not sure if it is related to  in my case? I see in the log of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4852&gt;#4852&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that something with  happens. This is not the case in my code. The model I want to save was stored by TF with . No numpy involved inbetween this saving and restoring a few lines later. Also, it seems that according to the error message above it wants to access some  temp file, which it should not try to access.

		A quick experiment confirmed: If the above save_path is something like ~/tmp/ (i.e. in my local home), the problem does not exist. So the global /tmp causes problems. tensorboard logs into /tmp without problems, as additional information.

 Going a bit through the history, this seems to be related to a larger change introduced some time ago here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/02adcaeec5f541870750e46ef5b1663bd9b61246#diff-1cc1b8538a5abd0cad0209d2aa34b116R134&gt;02adcae#diff-1cc1b8538a5abd0cad0209d2aa34b116R134&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Your most recent comment leads me to suspect this might be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4921&gt;#4921&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Could you please take a look at that?

		<comment id='7' author='osdf' date='2016-10-15T07:18:02Z'>
		I took a closer look. What is the save_path you're passing to self.saver.restore? If it's a value like /tmp/foo then FileSystem::GetMatchingPaths is going to go digging around in your /tmp directory. It needs to be a value like /tmp/foo/bar-?????-of-nnnnn which is returned by Saver.save(). So the save_path parameter really should be called save_pattern.

		<comment id='8' author='osdf' date='2016-10-15T07:29:49Z'>
		It is /tmp/6d7079c109e5_0-saver_853, returned by Saver.save() (though I set this name there, too). So you are saying that it needs to be in a separate directory in /tmp, e.g. like /tmp/6d7079c109e5/ (away from computer, can't check)?

 This one sounds like it could be a file i/o related bug. I'm not sure if it's necessarily related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/4921&gt;#4921&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Although there does appear to be overlap.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/osdf&gt;@osdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'm stating the painfully obvious here, but sudo might be a workaround for the time being.

		I think for a short term fix, can you make it sub dir? I need to change GetMatchingFiles to ignore some of these permission failures and not throw an error.
The way get matching files works is that it finds the top level directory that doesn't have a wildcard which is /tmp and then recursively looks into it to find matches. So making a subdir will not only fix this but make this go faster too.
But I agree that we need to refine the saver / GetMatchingFiles behavior to not do so badly on such cases.

		I made &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c15bb7b6f64fbc4bfd19aeccfd8b8df99012b74c&gt;c15bb7b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This should help a bit I think. Hopefully this would mean that the Permission denied error directories aren't being looked at. I'll fix that too now though.

 for your effort!! I resolved the issue now by having a subdirectory with-in , which then is used to write saver objects. Actually, this is much cleaner and easier to handle (just move the whole subdirectory out of ). Should I close this issue?

		<comment id='14' author='osdf' date='2016-10-28T20:03:09Z'>
		Actually I would like to fix this entirely (i.e. even without the sub-dir). Could you try that out and let me know if there are still issues?

		I think this should be fixed now. Closing issue now. Please reopen if you still face problems.
