&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The FGSM  implementaiton in the documentation seems to be incorrect.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the doc, image_probs which is equal to the value model.predict(image),  is used to calculate the perturbation.
perturbations = create_adversarial_pattern(image, image_probs)
The create_adversarial_pattern function takes input_image and input_label. So the above code is the same as the blow code.
perturbations = create_adversarial_pattern(input_image=image, input_label=model.predict(image))
However, input_label must be not the predicted probability of the model, but the (one hot encoded) correct label of input_image, I think. In fact, it is calculated that
prediction = pretrained_model(input_image)
loss = loss_object(input_label, prediction)
in the create_adversarial_pattern function.
Sorry if I have misunderstood.

If my understanding is correct, I will submit a PR. But I do not have confidence that my understanding is correct yet.
