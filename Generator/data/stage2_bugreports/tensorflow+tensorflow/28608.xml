from __future__ import print_function

with tf.device('cpu:0'):
    val0 = tf.ones((1,), dtype=tf.float32)
    val0 = tf.Print(val0, [])
    a = tf.atan2(val0, val0)
    b = tf.atan2(val0 + 1, val0 + 1)
    c = tf.concat([a, b], axis=0)
    c = tf.identity(c)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(c))

 I could reproduce this with TF1.13.1. However, with TF2.0, the results are what you expected. &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/40edc993f3c1ce726a47dddd5bff7c6d/untitled151.ipynb&gt;GitHub Gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is here for TF2.0.0-alpha0. Thanks!

 In your link tf.Print is removed (I believe it was deprecated and removed in 2.0?). However, removing the tf.Print op in 1.13 also "fixes" the behavior, so this does not address the problem.
My concern is that this bug is some memory problem, and "just use 2.0" isn't a solution. It's also not possible for everyone to just upgrade to 2.0 since tensorflow is often integrated into large projects where upgrading takes a significant amount of time.
The answer I get for the second value is 1.1071488 which is equal to atan2(2.0, 1.0), so tensorflow may be reading memory erroneously. If so, this is very concerning and undercuts any results I get in tensorflow: how do I know they're correct if there are bugs like this? Is there a way to avoid this specific bug in tensorflow 1.13?

		This looks like a grappler bug which was fixed a few months ago. Can you reproduce it on nightly?

 After installing tf-nightly (1.14.1) it does indeed seem to be fixed. Thanks! Do you by chance know which commit fixed this issue?
