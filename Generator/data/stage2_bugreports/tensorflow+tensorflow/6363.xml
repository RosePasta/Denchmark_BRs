It would be great if there was a section in the tensorflow.org website where the community could provide tutorials for new users. There are a lot of great tutorials in the web and having some on the tensorflow.org website would be very valuable for people just starting out. Thoughts?
Here is an example of what I would love to share:

		Please add them to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/resources/index.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/resources/index.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is less prominent than we'd like at the moment, but whatever new place will be seeded with information from there.
