	<summary>import_graph_def's input_map doesn't remap control inputs</summary>
	<description>
If a graph g has a node y with a control input like ^x, I would have thought that tf.import_graph_def(g, input_map={"x": z}) would result in a graph having a node y with a control input^z.
Instead I get an error: ValueError: Attempted to map inputs that were not found in graph_def: [x:0].  This is on master.
Complete example:
import tensorflow as tf
g1=tf.Graph()
with g1.as_default():
    x=tf.constant(0.0, name="x")
    with tf.control_dependencies([x]):
        y=tf.constant(1, name="y")
g2=tf.Graph()
with g2.as_default():
    z=tf.constant(1.0, name="z")
    tf.import_graph_def(g1.as_graph_def(), input_map={"x": z})

		Nice reproducible example!
It works if you do ^x instead of x
   tf.import_graph_def(g1.as_graph_def(), input_map={"^x": z})
Looking at the relevant logic, in importer.py, it seems it takes name of node directly from graphdef, so "x" would have two names, "x" and "^x" depending on the role, and you'd need to specify two remapping rules for it. Not ideal, not sure if there's an easy way to fix it, cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry&gt;@mrry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 because he left a comment there
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  for i, input_name in enumerate(
      [_CanonicalInputName(x) for x in node.input]):
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thanks! Unfortunately, if you use the C API via TF_GraphImportGraphDefWithReturnOutputs in analogy to the above example, it still doesn't work to use ^x instead of x as the remapping key.
AFAICT, mapping control inputs is impossible in the C API.

		Reassigning this to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/skye&gt;@skye&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, who's currently reconciling the Python and C APIs for importing graphs.
(If the trick &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yaroslavvb&gt;@yaroslavvb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested works, that's only by accident, since we didn't originally intend to provide a way to remap control inputs using . It doesn't seem too problematic to allow it though...)

		As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yaroslavvb&gt;@yaroslavvb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 noted, you should use "^x" in the input map. Using "x" in the input map is equivalent to "x:0", i.e. the non-control output of .
However, when I try running your code snippet above with "^x", it looks like that functionality is broken. I'll work on patching it.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/malmaud&gt;@malmaud&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the C API should work with control inputs. You'd use something like the following:

Note the use of -1 to indicate a control edge. This should be documented in the header comment, sorry for the confusion. For those following along, this functionality is only checked in on master (not 1.0).

		Thanks! I did eventually figure out the  magic constant and wrote &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/7724&gt;a PR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to document it.

 any updates on the patch?

		Oops, forgot to update this issue.
This has been resolved. To remap a control input, use the  method: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/c/c_api.h#L922&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/c/c_api.h#L922&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The -1 trick should still work too, although I think is technically undefined behavior.
