	<summary>Deep MNIST Tutorial would benefit from some diagrams of the neural network architecture</summary>
	<description>
The basic version of this tutorial has a &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/images/softmax-regression-scalargraph.png&gt;nice diagram&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that makes it really clear what model the code is attempting to reproduce.
The Deep MNIST for Experts tutorial however doesn't have such an image, especially for the Multilayer Convolutional Network that is the heart of the article. I had a hard time (and still do, a bit) visualising what exactly the model code is attempting to do. I think the tutorial would benefit from some diagrams.
I am willing to contribute this if someone could handhold me a bit as to how the graphic above was generated and what the bar is for contributing to the docs.

		I think that's reasonable to have. Just submit a PR, and we'll handle it from there. Images are a bit tricky for us to sync, so we might remove them from github and push them separately to the documentation site. Feel free to open a PR and CC me on it.
