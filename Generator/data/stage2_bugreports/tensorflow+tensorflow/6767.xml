 is there some existing benchmark that tracks dynamic_rnn?

		There have been a number of chanes.  There are internal benchmarks but no red flags.
Any chance you could send the chrome traces (from tf.Timeline) from 0.12 and master?  We're looking for:

All ops still running on GPU
All ops still running on the same GPU

depending on which one of these is different, I can help more.

 I'm not quite understand 'chrome trances tf.Timeline' how to ?
I find below warnings might these hurt perfomance?
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.2 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use AVX instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.

		Here are instructions for generating timeline: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1824#issuecomment-225754659&gt;#1824 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Those warnings were added recently and they are probably irrelevant to your case

		Not sure if it is ok just to trace one sess run step, below are the two generated chrome trances.

 Is this still an issue?
Could you comment and/or close this issue if it is resolved?

		I think there has been a regression in tf 1.4; i don't think it's specific to dynamic_rnn, but other models are seeing it too.  We can close this as a duplicate but the timeline here is useful.  However, I do think someone from core TF team should be looking at these TF performance regressions in v1.4.

		Actually; i see this is for TF 1.0 vs tf 1.2.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chenghuige&gt;@chenghuige&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 what is the performance like with TF nightly?
