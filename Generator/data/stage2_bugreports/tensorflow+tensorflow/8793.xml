	<summary>python StagingArea documentation missing</summary>
	<description>
StagingArea (and perhaps other structures in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py&gt;data_flow_ops.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) are not present in the python documentation. They are however mentioned in the 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/346bd59b3c99055c3fdcbc0d0b0710418f48c5c6/RELEASE.md&gt;release notes&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What other attempted solutions have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A search of the docs for &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/s/results/?q=StagingArea&gt;"StagingArea"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 doesn't reveal any of the docstrings present in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py&gt;data_flow_ops.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/stage&gt;Stage&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and Unstage are present in the C++ documentation.

		StagingArea was added under tf.contrib.staging.StagingArea with this commit 8 days ago:   &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/90733a8024532f6993d11f0a89deaecb2bba59fe&gt;90733a8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This will allow the documentation to be generated for it.  The new docs should go up this coming weekend.
