	<summary>tf.keras.preprocessing.image.save_img() flips dimensions of images created from tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory()</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS Big Sur 11.1
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.4.0-rc4-71-g582c8d236cb 2.4.0
Python version: 3.8.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
GPU model and memory: Intel Iris 1536 MB

Describe the current behavior
-&gt; A directory hierarchy with the following format is created
/Project
|-- data
|    -- class-1
|        -- image1.jpg
|        -- image2.jpg
|        -- ...
|    -- class-2
|        -- image1.jpg
|        -- image2.jpg
|-- venv (tensorflow, pillow)
|    -- ...
|-- bug.py
in which the images have uneven dimensions (ie. 640x360 as opposed to 256x256)
-&gt; A dataset is imported from a directory using tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory()
-&gt; A single image is taken from the dataset using next(dataset)
-&gt; The image is saved using tf.keras.preprocessing.image.save_img()
Unexpected Behavior: the resulting image has dimensions 360x640 instead of 640x360 and is heavily warped
Describe the expected behavior
The image should have the same dimensions as when it was imported ie. 640x360
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
Github repo (couldn't figure out how to get it into a Jupyter notebook)

		Realized this was a bug with my own code, I was inputting my dimensions incorrectly. In the Image_dataset_from_directory() function call I was passing in image_size=(640, 360) instead of (360, 640). This caused the warping which I blamed on the function rather than the incorrect order of parameters
