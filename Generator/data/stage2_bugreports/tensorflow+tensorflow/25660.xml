I am trying to build the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/examples/android&gt;TF Lite detect app&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with using NNAPI, but when I set useNNAPI to  it crashes with an exception:

But, when I set useNNAPI to  it runs without any issue. On the other hand, I also tried to use NNAPI with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/examples/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/demo/TFLiteImageClassifier.java&gt;TFL Classifier app&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it runs flawlessly (it means there is no problem with my phone). The question is that, is it possible to use NNAPI with detector app or not?

Changed few lines in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/examples/android/app/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/demo/TFLiteObjectDetectionAPIModel.java#L120&gt;TFLiteObjectDetectionAPIModel.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Post-processing ops of the model used by the TF Lite detect app are not supported by NNAPI.

		Thanks for your answer. Do you have any update when will NNAPI support that Post-processing op?

		The new NNAPI delegate should support this path, and doesn't require the full model be delegated.
