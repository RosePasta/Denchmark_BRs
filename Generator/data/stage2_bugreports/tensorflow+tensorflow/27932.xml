For gardient clipping in case of Adam optimizer, I'm using below code.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Create an optimizer.
opt = AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)

# Compute the gradients for a list of variables.
grads_and_vars = opt.compute_gradients(loss)

# grads_and_vars is a list of tuples (gradient, variable).  Do whatever you
# need to the 'gradient' part, for example cap them, etc.
capped_grads_and_vars = [(MyCapper(gv[0]), gv[1]) for gv in grads_and_vars]

# Ask the optimizer to apply the capped gradients.
opt.apply_gradients(capped_grads_and_vars)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But I'm getting error

NameError: name 'MyCapper' is not defined

Fulltraceback:
`grads = [(MyCapper(gv[0]), gv[1]) for gv in grads_and_vars]
NameError: name 'MyCapper' is not defined`
Pleae help.

		The above code snippet is taken from the official TensorFlow website &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/Optimizer&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  function has been called there.

 You need to write MyCapper function according to your requirement. If you don't want to constrain your gradients, then comment that line (where  is there) and run. Thanks.
I am closing this issue. Please post this kind of support questions in Stackoverflow. Thanks!
