	<summary>Autograph fails for keyword-only arguments</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip install tf-nightly-gpu-2.0-preview
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-1847-gc095504 2.0.0-dev20190514
Python version: 3.7.3

Describe the current behavior
Autograph complains when compiling functions with keyword-only arguments.
Example output:
W0515 01:46:22.158518 139635868194560 ag_logging.py:145] Entity &lt;function f at 0x7eff8120c1e0&gt; could not be transformed and will be executed as-is. Some features (e.g. tensor-dependent conditionals and loops) may not work as expected. Error details can be found in the logs when running with the env variable AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY &gt;= 1. Please report this to the AutoGraph team. Cause: Unexpected error transforming &lt;function f at 0x7eff8120c1e0&gt;. If you believe this is due to a bug, please set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10) and attach the full output when filing the bug report. Caused by: inconsistent nodes: None (NoneType) and None (NoneType)
Describe the expected behavior
Autograph works for keyword-only arguments
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
@tf.function
def f(*, a):
     return a*2

f(a=0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I have reproduce the mentioned output with TensorFlow version 2.0.0-dev20190515 on Colab.

		Thanks for filing the bug! At a glance, it looks related to the lone * arg without a name; probably its name field is None in the AST. We should have fix soon.
