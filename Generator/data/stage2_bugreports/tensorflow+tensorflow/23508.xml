	<summary>AttributeError: 'Estimator' object has no attribute '_distribution'</summary>

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.11
Python version: 3.6
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.2/7.2.1
GPU model and memory: TitanXp 12Gb

When I use an Estimator with a MirroredDistributionStrategy, I encounter the error "AttributeError: 'Estimator' object has no attribute '_distribution'". This seems to be tied to this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a6d8ffae097d0132989ae4688d224121ec6d8f35/tensorflow/python/estimator/estimator.py#L1330&gt;line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which has . I'm pretty sure this should be .
The estimator is clearly never assigned a '_distribution' attribute (this is the only line on which its referenced) so I assume this is just a typo. Let me know if I'm missing something.

		Same problem on a fresh install from source from the master branch. I made that change and it works perfectly.

  This should not be a problem with TF version 1.12. Have you tried with 1.12 ?

 This was broken when I did it on the master branch a few days ago, which is v1.12.

		I havenâ€™t tried with 1.12 although the reference to _distribution still exists in the source of 1.12, so not sure that would do anything. I can test later today
