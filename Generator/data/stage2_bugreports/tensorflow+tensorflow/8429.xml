	<summary>Versions Web Page Needs Updating</summary>
	<description>
This really is a small issue but I couldn't submit a PR as I couldn't find the file for it.
At &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the current version is stated as 0.12 when it should be 1.0!
The docs at root (i.e. in tensorflow.org/api_docs) refer to the most recent stable branch (in this case, r0.12)
That's it. Sorry for raising an issue for such a trivial detail! Thanks

		This has been fixed. Now it should say "most recent stable branch (in this case, r1.2)". Thanks!
