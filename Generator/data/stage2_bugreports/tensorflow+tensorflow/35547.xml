System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): gLinux (like Debian)
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-21487-g2e8d5e5 2.1.0-dev20200102
Python version: Python 3.7.5rc1
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A

Describe the current behavior
Importing TensorFlow prints an unnecessary and unhelpful warning:

WARNING:tensorflow:Falling back to tensorflow client, its recommended to install the cloud tpu client directly with pip install cloud-tpu-client .

Describe the expected behavior
Importing TensorFlow should not print any messages about Cloud TPUs.
This is a normal desktop installation that doesn’t have anything to do
with TPUs, and doesn’t need them.
Code to reproduce the issue
python -c 'import tensorflow' 2&gt;&amp;1 | diff -u /dev/null -
