	<summary>[ja] Remove references to tf-nightly-2.0-preview package</summary>
	<description>
The tf-nightly-2.0-preview package does not exist anymore. Please upgrade all notebooks to use %tensorflow_version 2.x like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;try:
  # %tensorflow_version only exists in Colab.
  %tensorflow_version 2.x
except Exception:
  pass
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Affects:

/site/ja/lite/convert/python_api.md
/site/ja/guide/function.ipynb
/site/ja/tutorials/load_data/csv.ipynb

		Thank you for your notification, we'll update &amp; fix them.

		I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/152&gt;tensorflow/docs-l10n#152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixed this issue. However, we have to update these outdated documents.

/site/ja/lite/convert/python_api.md
ja/tutorials/load_data/csv.ipynb (it's broken as mentioned  https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/issues/138)

I'm going to update them and make two PRs for each document.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AseiSugiyama&gt;@AseiSugiyama&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for taking a look.
Now that Colab defaults to TF 2.2, we can remove the %tensorflow_version 2.x block from notebooks.
Mark just merged &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/152&gt;tensorflow/docs-l10n#152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which should remove them, but we may need to keep an eye on any outstanding pull requests

		Right, I would like to contribute to the TF community to be an "eye" ðŸ‘€
By the way, I found it is hard to update translated documents to follow the original document since we lack the sync tool like nb_code_sync.py after separating docs repo and docs-l10n repo. Do you have any ideas about this?

 Hello.  should still work, you can pass it the  argument.
But, point taken, I'll look into streamlining that tool now that the repos are separate

 How about the result of your taking a look? I think it is not obvious the way to maintain the  directory and other languages' directory that we can use  with git only because  and  are separated.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AseiSugiyama&gt;@AseiSugiyama&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , thanks for taking a look.
I made the command-line errors a little easier to read in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/175&gt;tensorflow/docs-l10n#175&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but the script seems to work-as-intended:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Install deps:
$ pip3 install --user absl-py

# Assume you've downloaded both tensorflow/docs and tensorflow/docs-l10n repos
$ cd docs-l10n

$ ./tools/nb_code_sync.py --src=../docs/site/en/guide/function.ipynb \
    ./site/ja/guide/function.ipynb

Error: Notebooks must have same amount of code cells to sync between.
Please manually compare the source and destination notebooks.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Unfortunately. these Japanese notebooks are quite out-of-date and missing a number of code cells that are in the en/ source-of-truth. This script assumes that the number of code cells matches between the two notebooks to properly sync.
Quickly looking at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/blob/master/site/ja/guide/function.ipynb&gt;Japanese version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I can see that it's missing the "Debugging" section in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/guide/function.ipynb&gt;English version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (and maybe more).
For something like this, you'll have to manually look through and make sure it's structurally similar to the en/ version. nb_code_sync.py is really just meant to keep any code changes up-to-date and avoid too much drift.

 Thank you for your kindly reporting! It sounds nice that we will be able to use the  after updating these three notebooks (maybe). I made a PR for csv.ipynb &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/176&gt;tensorflow/docs-l10n#176&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and try to update all these notebooks.

		I updated related documents by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/176&gt;tensorflow/docs-l10n#176&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/190&gt;tensorflow/docs-l10n#190&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/pull/220&gt;tensorflow/docs-l10n#220&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and they've been marged 
I guess we can safely close this issue. Thank you for your work, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
