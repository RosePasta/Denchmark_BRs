	<summary>Tensorflow not working in Zeppelin 0.7.0</summary>
	<description>
There seems to be some issue using Tensorflow in Zeppelin 0.7.0 and it throws this error:
NameError: name _interactive is not defined
Another user reported the &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42757433/tensorflow-can-not-work-with-zeppelin&gt;same issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on SO. The fix suggested there seems to be really hacky.
The issue seems to be that in tf_logging.py file [.\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\platform\tf_logging.py] the _interactive variable is not triggering for Zeppelin.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Determine whether we are in an interactive environment
try:
  # This is only defined in interactive shells
  if _sys.ps1: _interactive = True
except AttributeError:
  # Even now, we may be in an interactive shell with `python -i`.
  _interactive = _sys.flags.interactive
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		It looks the code meant to have  before the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/platform/tf_logging.py#L40&gt;block&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Would you be willing to file a PR?
