	<summary>Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime.

Otherwise, if you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Here is a list of builtin operators you are using: ADD, CAST, CONCATENATION, CONV_2D, DIV, EXPAND_DIMS, FILL, FLOOR, GATHER, GATHER_ND, LEAKY_RELU, MAXIMUM, MEAN, MINIMUM, MUL, PACK, PAD, RANGE, RESHAPE, RESIZE_BILINEAR, RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR, SHAPE, STRIDED_SLICE, SUB, TRANSPOSE_CONV, UNPACK. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: MaxPoolWithArgmax, Size.</summary>

		You can convert your model with Select TF operator set. Please take a look:
