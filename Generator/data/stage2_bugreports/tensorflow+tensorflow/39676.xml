Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the exact command if possible to produce the output included in your test case. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new&gt;the Github new issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

"I confirmed numerous times again, that recurrent_dropout promotes exploding gradients (nan loss &amp; weights) "

i use
same problem with Tensorflow : 2.0.0 and Keras : 2.2.4-tf
with prebuilt tensorflow pip package under windows

		i am try wit TF 2.2 at colab

		Hi
i write standalone code to reproduce the issue
tested with TF 2.2 at colab
problem related to GRU and timesteps value

 I think this was resolved already. Please check the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/cbe0be8152adfa6680d1665c0adbba1e/gru_recurrent_dropout_bug.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with . I had checked on local also.
