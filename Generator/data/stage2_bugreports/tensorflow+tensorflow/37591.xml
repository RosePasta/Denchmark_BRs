&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/rgb_to_yuv?version=nightly&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/rgb_to_yuv?version=nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

(1) The example image x has pixel values which are not in the range of [0,1]. So, it can't be fed to rgb_to_yuv directly without scaling it.
(2) Users of the API need example which is close to practical scenario. In this case, nobody wants to see the values changed by the function but they want correct implementation and pre-processing example.
