THE PROBLEM: The Docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:1.13.1-gpu-py3-jupyter doesn't build as per the instructions here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu_support_2&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu_support_2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Using the tensorflow/tensorflow:1.13.1-gpu-py3-jupyter Docker image the build fails at the first step. (./configure) There's nothing in the /tensorflow directory.
Using the tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly-devel-gpu-py3 Docker image everything works fine and after being built tensorflow can be imported in python within the Docker container. In this image there is source code in /tensorflow.
ALSO, in this Docker container /usr/local/lib has only python3.5. In the nightly-devel-gpu-py image there is a bazel directory

		Hmm... those docs may be out of date;  is a legacy Docker image.  is the newer equivalent with . &lt;denchmark-link:https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/&gt;Our Docker Hub page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 may help explain our available tags.
Ping &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lamberta&gt;@lamberta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		OK, devel-gpu-py3 appears to have all the pieces I was looking for. I've pulled a copy of the image and have started a build using the commands on the old possibly out-of-date page. I'll report back tomorrow as to the results.
Thanks for the help and I need to learn about this ping thing going on here! :-)

		devel-gpu-py3 appears to be Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, I'm 18.04 LTS which is python-3.6. After installing python-3.5 on my system I am able to run tensorflow in a virtual environment created using python-3.5 and it see my GTX 960 so it's a big win. Thanks! However is there a 18.04/python-3.6 Docker image to make it a more direct install on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS?

		The images are all based on Ubuntu 16.04 (some of the older images were updated to 18.04, but are no longer used) -- we just haven't had the time to update them (you can find the infrastructure in tensorflow/tools/dockerfiles, if you are interested in updating them). The 16.04-based images should still work for you if you don't mind using the older Python version.

		Hi. Can someone update these files with the correct info? Thanks
