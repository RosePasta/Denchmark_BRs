	<summary>tf.assign_from_checkpoint_fn needs write_version argument to pass to tf.Saver</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/slim/slim_walkthough.ipynb&gt;slim_walkthrough.ipython&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, when we load from checkpoints we can use  function.
But (maybe i thought) inside of slim.assign_from_checkpoint_fn, it create tf.Saver but there is no write_version args. And in my case, I have some ckpt with saver V2 but default saver version is 1 and slim.assign_from_checkpoint_fn doesn't have any code about this version issue so I can't load model using this function.
Any clue or plan to handle this issue?
Thanks.

		It looks like this request is to get write_version added as an argument to tf.assign. Could you take this on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/concretevitamin&gt;@concretevitamin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or comment on what a better way to solve this problem might be. Thanks!

: if I understand you correctly, I think you

Used the master branch to produce a V2 checkpoint.
Try to load it with some code (in this case, some contrib code) in an official release (or candidate).

This is not a supported use case.  If you do your second step also in master, it should work (I pushed out the default version switch this week).
