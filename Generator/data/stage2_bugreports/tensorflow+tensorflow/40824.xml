	<summary>Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Y
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0
Python version: 3.74
GPU model and memory: Intel(R) HD Graphics 530

I write in C# and use ML.net but the error comes from Tensorflow library.
While trying to Fit the model
ITransformer model = trainingPipeline.Fit(trainingDataView); 
it gives following error:
Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore

 Thank you for your answer.
I generated an image classification model with Visual Studio. After I tried to change some hyper-parameters like number of epochs, batchsize, etc to see if it will give better results. But it gave me an error "Saver not created because there are no variables in the graph to restore". I began to look for an error, returned initial parameters and tried to recreate default model:

CreateModel() works good till the moment when it calls

Here something goes wrong and I have the error.

You will find the code here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kwijik/ict&gt;https://github.com/kwijik/ict&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

There are 5 .cs files and a folder  with images.

 No problem. You can use the code from  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kwijik/ict&gt;https://github.com/kwijik/ict&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . If for some reason you cannot, follow these steps:
1 Install Visual studio 2019
2 Download images from my repository
3 Install ML.Net and Model Builder
4 Try to generate image classification model (here is an example &lt;denchmark-link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder&gt;https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
After I describe my actions here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/40824#issuecomment-651021357&gt;#40824 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
