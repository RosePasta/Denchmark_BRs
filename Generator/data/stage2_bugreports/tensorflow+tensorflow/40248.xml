System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colab
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3
Python version:3.8
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: colab
GPU model and memory: gtx 1060

I'm getting the following error,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;

Function call stack:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The error log is pointless that it doesn't even tell me where the error could be in my code.
