	<summary>DOCS for offsets in extract_glimpse don't match Implementation</summary>
	<description>
Docs state:

offsets: A Tensor of type float32.
A 2-D integer tensor of shape [batch_size, 2] containing
the x, y locations of the center of each window.

whereas &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/754048a0453a04a761e112ae5d99c149eb9910dd/tensorflow/core/kernels/attention_ops.cc#L92&gt;the implementation states&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

 // calling TensorFlow operates with (y,x) as indices.


Notice x,y vs y,x
Here is a rough demo of the issue:
arr = np.zeros((1,5,5,1), dtype=np.float32)
arr[0, 3,2] = 1
arr = tf.constant(arr)
glim = tf.image.extract_glimpse(arr, (1,1), offsets=tf.constant([(2,3)], dtype=tf.float32)[:,::-1] + 1, normalized=False, centered=False)
sess.run(glim)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; array([[[[ 1.]]]], dtype=float32)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It appears that the docs are wrong and that the comment is right.

		yes, this looks like a bug in the docs.  I'll submit a fix to the docs.

		Is that the right place to fix or would it be better to take x y which is more normal and would simplify op code ad well.

		Also not sure if there are any additional docs fixes outlined in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/2134&gt;#2134&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		In the immediate term, fixing the docs seems good to do since any changes in the behavior will break backwards compatibility and so requires more stages to accomplish.

		Since the expected shape of the input is [batch_size, height, width, channels], then I think y,x makes some sense since it's the same order as values in the input shape.
