Describe the current behavior
saved_model_cli
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/tarrade/anaconda-release/conda-env/env_test/bin/saved_model_cli", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from tensorflow.python.tools.saved_model_cli import main
  File "/Users/tarrade/anaconda-release/conda-env/env_test/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/tools/saved_model_cli.py", line 51, in &lt;module&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
with TF 2.1:
saved_model_cli
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;usage: saved_model_cli [-h] [-v] {show,run,scan,convert} ...
saved_model_cli: error: too few arguments
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and if we pass all needed argument then it is working as expected
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
just use the command line:
saved_model_cli
