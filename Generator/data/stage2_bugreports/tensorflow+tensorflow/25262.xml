	<summary>Usage of tf_stack.extract_stack in registry.py breaks TensorFlow R client</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Fedora 29
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: NA
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): nightly
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): NA
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): NA
CUDA/cuDNN version: NA
GPU model and memory: NA

Hi,
this usage of tf_stack in registry.py
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;stack = tf_stack.extract_stack()
user_function = stack[2]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

breaks the TensorFlow for R client, because at that point, when called from R stack is of length 2, with both elements being of length 6.
This is analogous to the recently fixed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25067&gt;#25067&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jtkeeling&gt;@jtkeeling&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
It would be awesome if this could still be fixed for the 1.13 release, as I'm aware of no workaround and we have users that want to register a custom gradient.
Many thanks!

		Yes, this is entirely analogous to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/25067&gt;#25067&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I've authored a fix and sent for review.

 This is another piece of code that uses tf_stack. I've sent you another change that fixes this one.
