	<summary>Wrong error message during compiling</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Amazon Linux 2017.03
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): release v1.3.0
Python version: 3.6.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.5.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 7.5/cuDNN 5.1.10
GPU model and memory: Tesla K80
Exact command to reproduce: remove patch command and try to compile

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There's a wrong error message when you try to compile TensorFlow without patch command installed. It's not a big deal but could take a couple of hours to figure it out.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 we should update the pre-requisites.
Thank for reporting this, @eaperz! If you want to send a PR, that's also great.

		Is it good to check whether  is installed before it is invoked &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/12a628a623a5dae81b8fc699792eaf414e6ace41/tensorflow/workspace.bzl#L110&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I think it should be checked in a pre-requisite stage, along with all other pre-requisites to build. Unfortunately it's my first contact with tensorflow and I have no idea where in the code is this verification done.

		@eaperz  I agree with you. Since I'm not familiar with bazel, I don't know how to do pre-check yet.

		Best place would probably be in the (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/configure.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/configure.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) script.
