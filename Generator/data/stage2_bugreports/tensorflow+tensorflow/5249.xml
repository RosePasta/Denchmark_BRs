 This is straight from our pip package. I don't see how this could have passed the tests.

 that is the rc1 package. I looked at the  and it's not like . Not sure if v2 saving is supposed to work there. Since the code is there, I assume it's supposed to work.

		saver.py does indeed have save_v2, but ops/io_ops doesn't have Register.*V2.

 could you take a look?

		I'll take a look tomorrow.

		Sorry for the troubles -- rc2 will likely not have this issue (we either will completely release the V2 functionalities, or none of it will go in; TBD).
Are you eager to use V2 right now to save peak memory?
		</comment>
		<comment id='7' author='cyc' date='2016-10-28T17:37:09Z'>
		No, using v2 is not hugely important. I just tried it out because I heard v1 was going to be deprecated soon.
		</comment>
		<comment id='8' author='cyc' date='2016-10-30T07:30:18Z'>
		OK, closing. rc2 will do it, and you can use v1 in rc1.

		I am getting this same issue using rc2 on Mac OSX el capitan.  Python 2.7, CPU only in Anaconda.  It works fine when I build from source, but using the pip package it does not work.  I downloaded the rc2 pip package today to check and installed using pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL while my environment is activated.  $TF_BINARY_URL was set using export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-py2-none-any.whl
If it matters, I had a previous version of tensorflow installed in this environment (0.11, rc1) before installing the pip package.  Also, when running in my built-from-source environment, I ran my code by copying it into the source (tensorflow/example/) directory, and building it with Bazel similar to the "image_retraining" example.

 can you try installing that pip package using a fresh environ?

 Tried a couple of things:
First, same environment, I ran  (not no upgrade here).  Same results.
Second, (still the same environment) I ran pip uninstall tensorflow then pip install --ignore-installed $TF_BINARY_URL.  Same results.
Third, I created a new environment (conda create -n test python=2.7 -y), then source activate test then pip install --ignore-installed $TF_BINARY_URL.  Same results as before.
The pip package created when building from source works when installing to a clean environment.

, thanks for your feedback. Let me take a look at our pip packages and get back to you.

, could you give "pip install" with $TF_BINARY_URL=&lt;denchmark-link:https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-py2-none-any.whl&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-0.11.0rc2-py2-none-any.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 another shot?

		That is working now.  Thank you for the quick responses.
