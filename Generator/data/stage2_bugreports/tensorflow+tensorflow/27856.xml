You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the current behavior
I get the following error message when I use tensorflow in GPU mode. When I use tensorflow in CPU mode, such error message doesn't occur.

AttributeError: module 'tensorboard.summary._tf.summary' has no attribute 'summary_scope'

Describe the expected behavior
I expect no error when I call tf.summary.scalar() in TF2.0 in both GPU and CPU mode.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
#!/usr/bin/python3

import tensorflow as tf;

def main():

    log = tf.summary.create_file_writer('checkpoints');
    with log.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss',1., step = 0);

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main();
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
