	<summary>Tensorflow V2.2.0 boot fail on aarch64</summary>
	<description>
When I run a testcase on my aarch64 platform, it reports error as:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorflow/core/platform/profile_utils/cpu_utils.cc:106] Failed to find bogomips or clock in /proc/cpuinfo; cannot determine CPU frequency
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And I found core/platform/profile_utils/cpu_utils.cc not support aarch64 yet as follows:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#if (defined(__powerpc__) || \
     defined(__ppc__) &amp;&amp; (__BYTE_ORDER__ == __ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__))
    retval = sscanf(line.c_str(), "clock              : %lfMHz", &amp;cpu_freq);
    freq_factor = 1.0;
#else
    retval = sscanf(line.c_str(), "bogomips : %lf", &amp;cpu_freq);
#endif
    if (retval &gt; 0) {
      const double freq_ghz = cpu_freq / 1000.0 / freq_factor;
      if (retval != 1 || freq_ghz &lt; 0.01) {
        LOG(WARNING) &lt;&lt; "Failed to get CPU frequency: " &lt;&lt; freq_ghz &lt;&lt; " GHz";
        return INVALID_FREQUENCY;
      }
      const int64 freq_n =
          static_cast&lt;int64&gt;(freq_ghz * 1000.0 * 1000.0 * 1000.0);
      LOG(INFO) &lt;&lt; "CPU Frequency: " &lt;&lt; freq_n &lt;&lt; " Hz";
      return freq_n;
    }
  }
  LOG(WARNING)
      &lt;&lt; "Failed to find bogomips or clock in /proc/cpuinfo; cannot determine "
         "CPU frequency";
  return INVALID_FREQUENCY;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But my proc/cpuinfo is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;BogoMIPS        : xxx.xx
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which not match bogomips : %lf
Could anyone help to fix this issue?

A similar issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39185&gt;#39185&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, was fixed in TensorFlow v2.3. Could you please update TensorFlow to v2.3 and check if you are facing the same issue?
Also, please provide the exact sequence of commands or the code that you executed before running into the error? Thanks!
