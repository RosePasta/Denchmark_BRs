	<summary>Should we remove deprecated and ignored field 'version' in graph.proto</summary>
	<description>
We noticed that the version field in graph.proto has been deprecated (since 5 years ago). When we tried to generate GraphDef scala code by sbt-protoc from this proto file, it produced annoying "deprecation" warnings during the compilation stage.
Should we remove it from tensorflow's codebase?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/graph.proto#L24-L27&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/graph.proto#L24-L27&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

According to the description in the codebase:

// Deprecated single version field; use versions above instead.  Since all
// GraphDef changes before "versions" was introduced were forward
// compatible, this field is entirely ignored.

This field seems to be completely not used, no matter old or new versions.
We appreciate any feedbacks. Thanks!

		Hey, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ymodak&gt;@ymodak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for assigning correct tags on this issue. Is there any update?
I think we just need to remove the deprecated version field since it is not used at all.

		I don't think we can remove it until we are sure there is no client that expects to see it in the proto. Otherwise, said client will get a bad parse, segfault or exhibit other unwanted behavior.
