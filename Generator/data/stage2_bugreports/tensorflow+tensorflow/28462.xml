System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Centos7.5
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.12
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.19
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 6.3

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
I build tensorflow from source code for debug with the options "-c dbg"
I also remove the build options: "-c opt --copt=-O3"
With this debug version, I only get 1/10 performance comparing with the release version.
I don't know it's normal in your aspect?
Which one(add "-c dbg" or remove "-c opt --copt=-O3") may majorly cause this problem.
Describe the expected behavior
Debug version and release version has similar performance.
