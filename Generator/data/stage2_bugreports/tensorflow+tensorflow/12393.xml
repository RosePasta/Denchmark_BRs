	<summary>Anaconda installation example doesn't match the description on web site</summary>
	<description>
On this page:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#installing_with_anaconda&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#installing_with_anaconda&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Step 4 says:

where tfBinaryURL is the URL of the TensorFlow Python package. For example, the following command installs the CPU-only version of TensorFlow for Python 2.7:

However, the example command below it actually installs TensorFlow for Python 3.4, not 2.7:

pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade

		This was fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/17f9320b33069ecda689bc71a917f5df5911666f&gt;17f9320&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 at head (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/11708&gt;#11708&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), however it seems that that change didn't make it to the r1.3. branch and the website content is now from the r1.3 branch.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/av8ramit&gt;@av8ramit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 : Could you take a look - should that change be merged into the r1.3 branch and the website re-pushed?
