	<summary>Wrong inputs shape for 1D-inputs in keras with run_eagerly=True</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colab
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): default v2 for Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.0.0-0-g64c3d382ca 2.0.0
Python version: default for Colab
Bazel version (if compiling from source): No
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): No
CUDA/cuDNN version: Colab
GPU model and memory: Colab

Describe the current behavior
When compiling keras model with run_eagerly=True and passing 1D-inputs, model reshapes it into 2D.
When compiling with run_eagerly=False everything works as expected: layer obtains 1D-input.
Describe the expected behavior
Model should not corrupt inputs shape.

 I think this was resolved in recent . Please change the first line of your code to  and run the colab. Here is the output when  was selected.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;This should be (None,) because of 1D-input:  (2,)
1/1 [==============================] - 0s 1ms/step - loss: 4.0000
&lt;tensorflow.python.keras.callbacks.History at 0x7ff3319e4518&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For the same option (run_eagerly=True), earlier output is as follows which was not correct.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Train on 2 samples
WARNING:tensorflow:Model was constructed with shape Tensor("input_2:0", shape=(None,), dtype=float32) for input (None,), but it was re-called on a Tensor with incompatible shape (2, 1).
This should be (None,) because of 1D-input:  (2, 1)
WARNING:tensorflow:The list of trainable weights is empty. Make sure that you are not setting model.trainable to False before compiling the model.
2/2 [==============================] - 0s 5ms/sample - loss: 4.0000
&lt;tensorflow.python.keras.callbacks.History at 0x7fcb970bc4e0&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am closing this issue as it was resolved. Please feel free to reopen if I am mistaken. Thanks!
