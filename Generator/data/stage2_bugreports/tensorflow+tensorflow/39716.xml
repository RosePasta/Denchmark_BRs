	<summary>TF 2.2.0 ptxas issue</summary>
	<description>
Running in linux some code I get the following warning:
You are using ptxas 8.x, but TF requires ptxas 9.x (and strongly prefers &gt;= 9.2.88).  Compilation of XLA kernels below will likely fail.
However when I run with the flag TF_CPP_VMODULE=asm_compiler=2 I get this output:
2020-05-20 14:57:36.735438: I tensorflow/stream_executor/gpu/asm_compiler.cc:169] Looking for ptxas at /usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin/bin/ptxas
2020-05-20 14:57:36.735500: I tensorflow/stream_executor/gpu/asm_compiler.cc:169] Looking for ptxas at /usr/local/cuda/bin/ptxas
2020-05-20 14:57:36.735521: I tensorflow/stream_executor/gpu/asm_compiler.cc:178] Using ptxas at /usr/local/cuda/bin/ptxas
So it seems that when it's looking in cuda-10.1 it's going in the wrong dir (there is no cuda-10.1/bin/bin, the ptxas binary is in cuda-10.1/bin). Does anyone know how to fix this?
The situation is somewhat similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33375&gt;#33375&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the exact command if possible to produce the output included in your test case. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new&gt;the Github new issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

		Managed to find a workaround with
export XLA_FLAGS=--xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=path_to_cuda
