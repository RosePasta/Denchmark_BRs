	<summary>python documentation for tensorflow.abs out of sync</summary>
	<description>
I checked out the master branch tonight:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d4b5c606fc9fbd1a20b5b113b4bc831f31d889a3&gt;d4b5c60&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I installed the code with pip into a conda environment
It seems the tensorflow.complex_abs() function has been merged into the overloaded tensorflow.abs() function.
The docstring, along with the rest of the python documentation don't seem to reflect this change:

In [53]: tf.abs?
Signature: tf.abs(x, name=None)
Docstring:
Computes the absolute value of a tensor.
Given a tensor of real numbers x, this operation returns a tensor
containing the absolute value of each element in x. For example, if x is
an input element and y is an output element, this operation computes
\(y = |x|\).
Args:
x: A Tensor or SparseTensor of type float32, float64, int32, or
int64.
name: A name for the operation (optional).
Returns:
A Tensor or SparseTensor the same size and type as x with absolute
values.
File:      ~/src/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/math_ops.py
Type:      function

		This change is being documented as part of the 1.0 release process. Please see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Are you suggesting that we change the docstring above to say something like "Given a tensor of real or complex numbers x, this operation returns a tensor [...]"? If so, maybe this would be an easy opportunity for you to make a contribution to the codebase. We'd be grateful for a pull request. Otherwise maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xmbrst&gt;@xmbrst&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could take a look.
