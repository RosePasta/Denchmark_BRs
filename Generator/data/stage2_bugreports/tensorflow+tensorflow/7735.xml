	<summary>API Documentation with Links to Source Code</summary>
	<description>
I think it would be a really great improvement if the API documentation &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 would contain links to the corresponding source code file on GitHub, similar to python package documentations on readthedocs.org, e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/layers/base.html&gt;https://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/layers/base.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
This would also make it much faster to create pull requests that fix errors in the documentation.

		This is actually happening in the new docs. All the way on the bottom, e.g.: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/DType&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/DType&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Doesn't work for all things, but close.

		Oh wow, sorry for that! I guess I was looking for it in the wrong place...
That's really nice, but sometimes it's not clickable, e.g.: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/minimum&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/minimum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We're planning to move up the include line to the top of the file soon so it's more visible.
Not sure what to do about the generated ops though.

		We have a plan for the generated ops, which involves rejigging our build to
place generated files into a predictable location. But it's a little bit
away.
