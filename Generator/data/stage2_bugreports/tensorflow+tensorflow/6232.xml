	<summary>Format Error on the Website</summary>
	<description>
Hi, on tensorflow.org there is part of documentation accidentally formatted into code. It's not a serious problem.  It's about initializer on r0.11. I didn't check if other versions have the same problem. Just  want to post it here for your information.

 (this actually won't lead you right to the location because of the error ).

		This seems fixed at head. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xmbrst&gt;@xmbrst&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is this worth fixing in earlier versions?
