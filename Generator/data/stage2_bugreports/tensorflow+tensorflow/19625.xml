	<summary>Raw pointer member variables of tflite::Interpreter are not initialized or released properly.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.8.0
Python version: 3.6.4
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.13.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.9)
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9/7
GPU model and memory: K80
Exact command to reproduce:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;bazel build -c opt --copt="-D TFLITE_PROFILING_ENABLED" tensorflow/contrib/lite/tools:benchmark_model
./bazel-bin/tensorflow/contrib/lite/tools/benchmark_model --graph=model.tflite
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Graph: [model.tflite]
Num runs: [50]
Inter-run delay (seconds): [-1.0]
Num threads: [1]
Warmup runs: [1]
Use nnapi : [0]
Initialized session in 0.002312s
Running benchmark for 1 ddditerations: 
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

There are two raw pointer member variables within tflite::Interpreter.


profiling::Profiler* profiler_ is not initialized.
It may cause segmentation fault if profiler_ is initialized with a nonzero value and users don't set it by tflite::Interpreter::SetProfiler.


ErrorReporter* error_reporter_
The default error reporter pointed by error_reporter_ will not be released.

		The raw pointer member variables are not owned by the Interpreter, but good point about the the profiler_ pointer, I am going to send a patch.
