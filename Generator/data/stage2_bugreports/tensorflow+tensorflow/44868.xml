	<summary>Micro_speech error when given new model</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code : Only changed the model and everything the model requires (size of it)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Nano 33 BLE Sense
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Arduino Library
TensorFlow Version: 2.1.0-ALPHA

When ran I get this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Feature generation failed
Requested feature_data_ size 536907080 doesn't match 1960

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It should be the basic micro_speech output with words found and time of them found.
It was originally working with this model, but for some reason, it is not longer working.
Code: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/michealcarac/TempMicroSpeech&gt;https://github.com/michealcarac/TempMicroSpeech&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In micro_speechwithfinal.ino:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;int8_t feature_buffer[kFeatureElementCount];

 kFeatureElementCount = (kFeatureSliceSize * kFeatureSliceCount);

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

in micro_features_micro_model_settings.h
However,
when
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;static FeatureProvider static_feature_provider(kFeatureElementCount,
                                                 feature_buffer);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

in  micro_speechwithfinal.ino
then in feature_provider.cpp
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
FeatureProvider::FeatureProvider(int feature_size, int8_t* feature_data)
    : feature_size_(feature_size),
      feature_data_(feature_data),
      is_first_run_(true) {
  // Initialize the feature data to default values.
  for (int n = 0; n &lt; feature_size_; ++n) {
    feature_data_[n] = 0;
  }
}

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

BUT for some reason, feature_size_ is 536907080 yet kFeatureElementCount was 1960 in the beginning...

		Issue fixed by creating a new model on TF 1.15.
