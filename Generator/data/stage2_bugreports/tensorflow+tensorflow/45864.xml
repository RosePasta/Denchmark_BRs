	<summary>Converting speech_embedding hub module to tflite results in `Encountered unresolved custom op: TensorArrayV3.Node`</summary>
	<description>
System information

Colab default settings
TF version: 2.4.0


Converting speech_embedding module ''&lt;denchmark-link:https://tfhub.dev/google/speech_embedding/1&gt;https://tfhub.dev/google/speech_embedding/1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
'' to tflite results in:
RuntimeError: Encountered unresolved custom op: TensorArrayV3.Node number 2 (TensorArrayV3) failed to prepare.
during inference.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;HUB_URL = 'https://tfhub.dev/google/speech_embedding/1'
TEST_PATH = '.'

embedding_layer = hub.KerasLayer(HUB_URL, input_shape=(16000,), trainable=False)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    embedding_layer
])

model.save(TEST_PATH)
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(TEST_PATH)


converter.allow_custom_ops = True
tflite_model = converter.convert()
tflite_model_file = 'converted_model.tflite'

with open(tflite_model_file, "wb") as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)

interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path=tflite_model_file)
interpreter.allocate_tensors()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

I am aware that STFT may not be supported by tflite yet. If this is the issue, is there a quick workaround?

Thanks,
Bryan

		Sorry for encountering this issue on my side. TensorArray is not supported via TensorFlow Lite currently.  We are working on supporting them in the future.

		I am trying to perform transfer learning using tf hub speech embedding . I was able to train it in tf 1.15 but to convert it to tflite
I used tf 2.4 as tf 1.15 was giving errors. I was successfully able to convert the model but I am not able to make predictions
for tf 2.4. my error is
RuntimeError: Container __per_step_0 does not exist. (Could not find resource: __per_step_0/_tensor_arraysTensorArrayV3_0)
(while executing 'TensorArrayScatterV3' via Eager)Node number 82 (TfLiteFlexDelegate) failed to invoke.
I also tried using tf-nightly where also I encountered error
RuntimeError: Tensor: tf.TensorArrayV3(56) buffer size mismatch 64(1) != 8(2)Node number 82 (TfLiteFlexDelegate) failed to invoke.
