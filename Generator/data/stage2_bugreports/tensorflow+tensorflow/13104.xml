	<summary>Fix tf.argmax/argmin documentation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/argmax&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/argmax&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The documentation does not explain what an "index" is. I can imagine a billion definitions of "index". Is it the same as the "index" in tf.one_hot?
The documentation does not explain what happens if axis is set to None.
"For vectors, use axis = 0.": Why?
The documentation should clearly explain how the rank+shape of the returned tensor correlates with the rank+shape of the input tensor.
The documentation incorrectly indicates that there is a guide if you click "See the guide", but it takes you to a function reference/index. A redundant 3 sentence description is not a "guide".

, if you have time, a PR would be most welcome to fix some of these things.

		I would love to do a PR to fix the documentation, but the truth is that I can't write it because I don't know the answer to those questions. That's why I wanted it to be documented in the first place. I've tried to reverse-engineer argmax to understand what it does in higher dimensions, but I can't say that got me anywhere.
