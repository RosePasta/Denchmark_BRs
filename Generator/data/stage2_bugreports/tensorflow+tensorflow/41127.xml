System information

TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.14
Python version: 3.7
GPU model and memory: GOOGLE COLAB
I want to do the deep cosine metric training with the VeRI data set, for this, I followed some recommendations proposed by the author here, my configuration files are the same used in this repository 
any help will be very useful

¿Hay alguna razón particular para usar una versión anterior de tf e intentar usar una versión más nueva si esto ayuda a resolver el problema?

with a newer version of tf, other problems are generated such as tf.session
