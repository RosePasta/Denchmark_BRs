	<summary>sqlite dataset fails to raise a StopIteration: incorrect result</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): issue is reproducible with both
TensorFlow version (use command below): Confirmed on 2.0 and 1.14
Python version: python2

Describe the current behavior
After creating a tf.data.experimental.SqlDataset() and performing a map and batch operaion, the dataset fails to raise a StopIteration after going through the entire database, and begins to repeat / recycle values incorrectly.
Describe the expected behavior
The dataset stops after returning all the records in the sqlite database.
Code to reproduce the issue
# --- Create a dummy sqlite database ---
import os
import sqlite3
pth = "/tmp/bug-report.sqlite"
if os.path.exists(pth): os.unlink(pth)

query = 'SELECT * FROM data'

con = sqlite3.connect(pth)
c = con.cursor()
c.execute('CREATE TABLE data (col1 Int)')

for i in range(3):
  c.execute('INSERT INTO data VALUES (' + str(i) + ')')

con.commit()

# print the db, just to show what's in there
c.execute(query)
print "Actual query results: ", c.fetchall()
con.close()

# --- create a tf sqlite dataset ---
import tensorflow as tf
print tf.version.VERSION

ds = tf.data.experimental.SqlDataset('sqlite', pth, query, (tf.int32))
ds = ds.map(lambda x: tf.identity(x))


# this is supposed to terminate after only two batchs since the sqlite db only
# has 2 entries, but it goes forever
print "Batch size of 2:"
i = 0
for e in ds.batch(2):
  print e
  
  i += 1
  if i &gt; 2: print "  Should have stopped by now"
  if i &gt; 10: print "    breaking early"; break
  
# if batch size is larger than the db size, it also fails to stop
print "Batch size of 4:"
i = 0
for e in ds.batch(4):
  print e
  
  i += 1
  if i &gt; 1: print "  Should have stopped by now"
  if i &gt; 10: print "    breaking early"; break

# if batch size is exactly a multiple of the sqlite db size, then it does
# raise a StopIteration correctly
print "Batch size of 3:"
for e in ds.batch(3):
  print e

Other info / logs
This has been reproduced on tensorflow versions 2.0, 1.14 and 1.15

		Thank you for the quick fix! Any chance this could make it into 1.15 too?

 We will have to wait for the PR to be merged into master. Once it is in the master, it might be cherry-picked into release 1.15 or 2.0. Though given 1.15's release schedule, I would not count on this fix being picked up in 1.15.
