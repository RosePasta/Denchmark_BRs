System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes, but it used to work.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian GNU/Linux 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.2.0-dev20200503
Python version: 3.7.3

Describe the current behavior
Hi,
I'm trying to train a BERT-based model on a TPU (using TensorFlow models). It used to work perfectly a week ago, and I haven't changed my code since then, but now whenever I'm trying to run it (on a GCP VM instance connected to a TPU node) I get this:

Any ideas about what could have happened?

Hi,
Unfortunately, I can't do that as my codebase is pretty big, but I can assure you that everything worked perfectly a week ago. I tried reverting to the tf-nightly version I used but it didn't help.

		This bug is still there. I have tried many versions and combinations. When I create dataset using from_tensor_slices, it works fine (but only on small datasets. after that protobuf limitations come into play). But when I try from_generator, or when I'm trying to prepare dataset on th fly (by using tokenization inside of map), it's throwing "failed to connect to all addresses". I think TF team needs to do something with it.
