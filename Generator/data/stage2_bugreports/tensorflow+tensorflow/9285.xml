	<summary>TensorBoard filter regresson</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:nightly (or 1.1.0rc2)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Start a tensorboard process
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorboard --logdir /efs/log/atari
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and try and filter. It does not have any effect.

		This isn't a performance bug; filtering on rc2 for tensorboard is just broken.

 It looks like TF 1.1 is shipping. Did this get fixed?

		Ping on this. Looks like filtering is broken in the TF1.1 wheel on Pypi.

		This is a pretty significant usability problem with TensorBoard. We often run TensorBoard on directories with many runs, and being unable to filter runs by name makes it very difficult to do useful things with TensorBoard.

		Confirming filtering is broken in TF 1.1 Linux CPU PyPI wheel.

		This regression happened somewhere between rc1 and rc2, BTW.

		Thanks for the report. This is fixed at master, so the bug won't be present in the next release.

		I am seeing this fixed on the nightly. Thanks!

, installed the nightly, seems to be fixed. Maybe it's that crazy html5lib-0.9999 dependency that's fixing it?
