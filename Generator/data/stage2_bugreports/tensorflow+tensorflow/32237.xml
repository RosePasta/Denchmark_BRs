		Hi, sorry for the late reply.
Currently, the GPU delegate should be part of the nightly builds of  frameworks distributed via CocoaPods. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ios#cocoapods_developers&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ios#cocoapods_developers&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more details.
Would that resolve your issue?
