		Not sure, but I believe you're looking at this notebook: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/load_data/images.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/load_data/images.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It looks fixed so closing this issue. But, FYI, the TF 1.x notebooks have been archived and are no longer maintained. Thanks
