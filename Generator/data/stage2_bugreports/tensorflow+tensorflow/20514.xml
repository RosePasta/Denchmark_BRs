&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary using conda
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.8.0
Python version: 3.5.2
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8.0/7.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
GPU model and memory: Quadro M2000M/ 4GB
Exact command to reproduce:
Tried to use quantized_relu_x and it doesn't work
I have already used quantized_conv2d and quantized_max_pool, both of them works fine, but have only problem when I use quantized_relu_x

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Other two quantized kernels QuantizedRelu and QuantizedRelu6 seem to have defined but QuantizedReluX appears to be missing, although three of them are registered together in core/ops/nn_ops.cc file
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Error message that I am getting is as follows:
InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'QuantizedReluX' with these attrs.  Registered devices: [CPU,GPU], Registered kernels:

no registered kernels

		Added a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/20700&gt;#20700&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for QuantizedReluX kernel.
