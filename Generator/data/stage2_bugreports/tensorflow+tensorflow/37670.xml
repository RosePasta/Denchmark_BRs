I have tried to reproduce &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , and got a "Please report this to the TensorFlow team." message:

def add(a, b):
  return a + b
add(tf.ones([2, 2]), tf.ones([2, 2]))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

output:

		I just tried TF 2.1.0 on Linux, Python 3.7.3, and everything works.
It is surprising that you have TF 2.1 on Python 3.8, given that the official 2.1 packages do not support Python 3.8. Maybe Arch Linux compiles their own versions? But that may be the cause of the problem.

		You're right, TF 2.x does not support Python 3.8 as written here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/install&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I use TF 2.1 because it's the newest official version and python 3.8 because it is the newest official version and installing an older version of Python including tensorflow and other python packages is quite a hassle under arch linux. You can either close this issue or rename this issue to "feature request: support Python 3.8"

		<comment id='3' author='Volker-Weissmann' date='2020-03-21T14:46:19Z'>
		BTW, TF 2.2 does support Python 3.8 and a rc1 is already available, so you can just pip install tensorflow==2.2.0rc1 with working Python 3.8 support.

		Thank you. I have also flagged the arch package as out of date (here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/tensorflow/&gt;https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/tensorflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). I included a link to this thread in the message to the arch tensorflow maintainer, because I couldn't find another source that said that TF 2.2. support Python 3.8.

		The Github release &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.2.0-rc1&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.2.0-rc1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 contains information about Python 3.8 being available for Windows and Linux (OS X support should be coming soon I believe).

		Ok, thank you.

Windows/Linux binaries for py3.8 are available in TF 2.2 .Can you try installing !pip install tensorflow==2.2.0rc1 and see still you are facing the issue?. Thanks!

		The autograph error no longer occurs if I use pip install tensorflow==2.2.0rc1 👍
