	<summary>quantize_graph round and quantize modes are broken</summary>
	<description>
Looking at code in master. /CC &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/petewarden&gt;@petewarden&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

A KeyError is always produced.
&lt;denchmark-link:already_visited&gt;Consider the round mode&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
    if self.mode == "round":
      self.already_visited = {}
      for output_node in output_nodes:
        self.round_nodes_recursively(output_node)
which &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/fa4ba830f437fdb9dc1085b4d68a3bab41a16e20/tensorflow/tools/quantization/quantize_graph.py#L402-L404&gt;will fails for all calls&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  def round_nodes_recursively(self, current_node):
    """The entry point for simple rounding quantization."""
    if self.already_visited[current_node.name]:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

with a key error since the already_visited dict will be empty.
