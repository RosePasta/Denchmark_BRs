	<summary>Documentation correction</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I think there might be a possible documentation error in that of tf.stack. It's said that the numpy equivalent is np.asarray. But np.asarray([]) will take lists of arbitrary shapes and makes it to a ndarray whereas tf.stack requires all the dimensions of objects in the list to be same. So the equivalent ideally would be np.stack.
Cheers,
Ramana
