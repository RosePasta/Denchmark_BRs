	<summary>Can't load Keras model with multiple MetaGraphs, can't pass tags</summary>
	<description>

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03
TensorFlow installed from: Preinstalled by Amazon
TensorFlow version: 1.15.0
Python version: 3.6
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: Nvidia Tesla V100

Describe the current behavior
When trying to load a saved model using keras.models.load_model, an error occurs stating that tf.saved_model.load requires a 'tags='. There is also no way to pass tags through the load_model function.
Describe the expected behavior
Model should load.

With  being a path to this model locally: &lt;denchmark-link:https://tfhub.dev/google/albert_xlarge/3&gt;https://tfhub.dev/google/albert_xlarge/3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.load_model("albert/")
Error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: Importing a SavedModel with tf.saved_model.load requires a 'tags=' argument if there is more than one MetaGraph. Got 'tags=None', but there are 2 MetaGraphs in the SavedModel with tag sets [['train'], []]. Pass a 'tags=' argument to load this SavedModel.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This issue is more suitable for TensorFlow Hub repo. Please post it on hub repo from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/issues&gt;here.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thanks!

 outside of the model (which I don't believe the TensorFlow Hub team would have any control of), the issue doesn't involve TensorFlow Hub. Any model with multiple MetaGraphs (where  requires the  argument), won't be able to be load correctly.

		I have tried on colab with TF version 1.15 , 2.2.0-dev20200226 and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/bb6967034ebefb8752f33de0378484f0/untitled680.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		You can load the module as a Keras layer to use it. Heres the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/gowthamkpr/b20285706b9fb5152adf2050016268aa/untitled25.ipynb&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I was also able to lad the model using  which has tags argument. Please find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/gowthamkpr/eaceca0db447e1ed7025d0bd07c68d8a/untitled26.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
keras.models.load_model  doesnt have tags argument explicitly defined and thats the reason why you are not able to load this model.

		Is there a way to load a model using tf.saved_model.load() and then add it to a Keras model?
		</comment>
		<comment id='6' author='uchua' date='2020-03-05T05:17:38Z'>
		You can take the outputs of the loaded model and create a new model with those outputs &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uchua&gt;@uchua&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can take a look at this&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41668813/how-to-add-and-remove-new-layers-in-keras-after-loading-weights&gt; issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
