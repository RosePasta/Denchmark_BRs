System information

MacOS Mojave: 10.14.6
TensorFlow installed from binary
TensorFlow version: 2.1.0

Provide the text output from tflite_convert
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If those are native TensorFlow operators, you might be able to use the extended runtime by passing --enable_select_tf_ops, or by setting target_ops=TFLITE_BUILTINS,SELECT_TF_OPS when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Otherwise, if you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Here is a list of builtin operators you are using: CONV_2D, FULLY_CONNECTED, RESHAPE, SOFTMAX, STRIDED_SLICE, TANH. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: TensorListFromTensor, TensorListReserve, TensorListStack, While.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also, please include a link to a GraphDef or the model if possible.
Any other info / logs

		Sorry, I didn't realize you were waiting a response.  I just tried running the converter (from the command line) as:
tflite_convert --output_file=/tmp/foo.tflite --keras_model_file=model.hdf5 --target_ops=options
with options as all three recommended possibilities:

TFLITE_BUILTINS
TFLITE_BUILTINS,SELECT_TF_OPS
SELECT_TF_OPS

and got the same result in each case:
