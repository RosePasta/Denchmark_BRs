	<summary>Errors in tf.Session().run or tf.reduce_max</summary>
	<description>
Question:
opt = sess.run(pred_DFS, feed_dict = {x: clinic_factors_val, keep_prob: 1.0, treatment: treat)})
opt1, Pat_pred = sess.run([output1,pred_DFS], feed_dict = {x: clinic_factors_val), keep_prob: 1.0, treatment: treat)})
print(opt1)
print(opt)
print(Pat_pred)
The relationship between pred_DFS and output1: pred_DFS = tf.reduce_max(output1,axis=1). output1 is an intermediate variable.
When pred_DFS is run alone, the result is wrong, but when pred_DFS and output1 are run together, the result of pred_DFS is correct. Why?
the result of a run：
opt1：[[0.23930925 0.36091098 0.61886203]]
opt：[0.72315866]
Pat_pred：[0.61886203]
Note that，the results are consistent when output1 is run alone and when pred_DFS and output1 are run together

@Zlz-shoulder
Please share complete stand alone code for us to replicate the issue faced along with tf version, or a colab gist with the issue faced for analysis.
I have shared complete stand alone code and the corrsponding data in https://github.com/Zlz-shoulder/test_errors/tree/master
In order to run ‘PH+BMC_matched_test.py’, you only need to assign the path of 'PH+BMC_matched_test.csv' to 'clinic_path' in the  ‘PH+BMC_matched_test.py’

		I have run alone pred_DFS or output1 twice, the results maintain unchange. but when pred_DFS and output1 are run together, the value of output1 is the same as the previous operation, but it is not true for pred_DFS.  It is so weird！

		I changed this function and it's right now: pred_DFS = tf.py_func(np.max, [output1,1], tf.float32).  Is ‘tf.reduce_max’ something wrong?！

		I fail to log in my Google account, and I also fail to create a new Google account. But I believe this is a simple problem, and you could find many similar errors on the Internet. In addition. I use the Tensorflor of 1.12.0.

		Yes, but your results do not have the questions that I encountered. This may be because you use TensorFlow of version 1.1.15 while I use TensorFlow of version 1.1.12.  In my settings, the output values of pred_DFS are different between When pred_DFS is run alone and when pred_DFS and output1 are run together. Why?

 Sorry for the late response. Can you please use the latest version on tensorflow 1.x i.e., tensorflow 1.15 and see if the issue still persists? Thanks!

		You had tested it on tensorflow 1.1.15 and found no errors, so I think that I do not need to test it on tensorflow 1.1.15. However, I found errors using the exactly the same code on tensorflow 1.1.12. In some of the first comments, I have described in detail the errors I encountered about tensorflow 1.1.12. Could you help me answer my question？

 This is likely been fixed in 1.15. So, that is the reason why we recommend using tensorflow 1.14 or later. Thanks!

		Many thanks! But I hope that you can help me comfirm whether it is an error in tensorflow 1.12  or an error with my codes. Thanks!

 This error is with tensorflow 1.12 and is been fixed in future versions. I would recommend you to use tensorflow versions &gt; 1.14. Thanks!
