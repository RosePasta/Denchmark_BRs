&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A clarification of the example and why it actually works.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the example mentioned, if the global step is 0, it is unclear how the learning rate will actually change.
The formula can be rewritten as follows:
d = (l - e) * (1 - g/s)^p + e
In the example, g = 0, which means the formula becomes (l - e) * 1 + e = l - e + e = l
So, I'm very unsure of why/how the learning rate in this example is actually going to decrease.

		global_step is an iteration. Thus when we set it to zero there should be no change since we didn't iterate over the batch. The formula to compute polynomial_decay does not accept negative values for global_step which makes sense since we cannot have negative iterations.

		If your explanation is correct, I am not sure how the documentation example reflects this:
Example: decay from 0.1 to 0.01 in 10000 steps using sqrt (i.e. power=0.5):
However, when you inspect the code segment, it is very clear that the global step is 0 and remains 0, which implies that you're not actually changing the learning rate. Then how is the example correct?
