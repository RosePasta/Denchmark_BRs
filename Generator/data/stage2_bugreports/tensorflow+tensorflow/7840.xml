	<summary>fused batch norm delay_updates confusion</summary>

 around line 347:
From its definition, delay_updates should delay updates to moving mean and moving average if we are training.
The way it is defined now, when is_training evaluates to Trure, smart_cond will pick the _delay_updates function which actually adds the update ops to the graph. Is that intended ?

		Yes, it is intended. Note that the ops are added to updates_collections=ops.GraphKeys.UPDATE_OPS, and will not be updated immediately, but later (why it is  called "delayed") before the loss computation &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/contrib/training/python/training/training.py#L414&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
On the other hand, _force_updates() will immediately update the moving mean and var, noting the added &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py#L333&gt;control dependencies&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for the clarification. What are the benefits of delaying the update ?

		You are welcome! Looks like it is a more efficient option in a distributed setting:
" One can set updates_collections=None to force the updates in place, but that
can have speed penalty, specially in distributed settings."

BTW, I'm closing this issue as it has been resolved.
