	<summary>tf.lbeta() error when fed with placeholder</summary>
	<description>
Hi, there seems to be a bug in tf.lbeta.
tf.lbeta(tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [3, 2, 3, None]))
# =&gt; ValueError: Can not squeeze dim[0], expected a dimension of 1, got 3 for 'lbeta_1/cond/Squeeze' (op: 'Squeeze') with input shapes: [3,2,3,?].

		What in particular doesn't work?  The old code had some static inference (see the tests).  After this recent fix, the same tests are still in place, and the code is much simpler, so I suspect there won't be any problems.
