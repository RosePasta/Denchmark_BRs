Typo
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Create the model
The model consists of three convolution blocks with a max pool layer in each of them. There's a fully connected layer with 512 units on top of it thatr is activated by a relu activation function. 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In Create the model section,
thatr should be that
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Create the model
