tensorflow.contrib.learn.TensorFlowEstimator fails under sklearn.base.clone()
This prevents the possibility to perform CV using sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_Score over this estimator.
The clone fails due to the fact the TensorFlowEstimator.get_params() returns a key named "params" that is not part of the constructor input parameters.
This causes sklearn.base.clone to fail when trying to clone the estimator using it's constructor:
TensorFlowEstimator(**params)

		TensorFlowEstimator is deprecated and is removed in future version. Please use Estimator.
That said, the issue probably will persist with Estimator so we are going to address it there.

		Automatically closing due to lack of recent activity. Since this issue is old at this point, please reopen the issue if it still occurs when tried with the latest version of Tensorflow. Thank you.
