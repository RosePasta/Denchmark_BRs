	<summary>Clarify Installation Docs for Windows (32-bit)</summary>
	<description>
Quick feature/docs request. I've noticed a few people on Stack Overflow asking about running Tensorflow on 32-bit machines. I'm aware that some people have had some success as described by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry&gt;@mrry&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's post here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/33635450/7604321&gt;S/O: "TensorFlow on 32-bit Linux?"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

One example of a confused user trying to use Windows:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44449972/how-to-install-tensorflow-for-windows-7-32bit-systemi-installed-python-3-532-b&gt;S/O: "how to install tensorflow for windows 7 32bit system?i installed python 3.5(32 bit) into my system and also installed anaconda 3.4.4(32 bit)"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I was wondering whether it was worth putting a little system requirement that reminded users that Tensorflow is only supported on 64 bit machines on the install page? Unless it is not then perhaps some little clarification? Cheers

		Ping!
I think this is something important, as we receive issues about installing on 32 bit OS every now and then.

		Hi, this has been fixed and is visible in master here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/install/install_windows&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/install/install_windows&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and will become root when r1.5 becomes the installable binary.  Thanks!
