	<summary>The document of tf.nn.dynamic_rnn needs to be re-formatted</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Someone take a look at the document page of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dynamic_rnn&gt;tf.nn.dynamic_rnn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think there are some formatting bugs in the second half of the web page.

 : Seems like the empty newlines in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py#L483&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.3/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py#L483&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are confusing the website generator?
Would either of you have some cycles to investigate?

		Hy, I was trying to solve this issue, but when I forked the project and download it my source code file is different of the file in the web, it doesn't have the empty newlines that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/asimshankar&gt;@asimshankar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 comments. Can anyone tell me why this is happening?

		It has been 14 days with no activity and the awaiting tensorflower label was assigned. Please update the label and/or status accordingly.
