	<summary>Incorrect mention of dataset....</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_lite/tflite_c05_exercise_rock_paper_scissors.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I think this exercise doesn't make use of cats_vs_dogs dataset, right??
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In place of cats_vs_dogs dataset, rock_paper_scissors dataset should be mentioned.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Yes, shortly

		Number 5 is an exercise with parts the reader needs to complete. Number 6 is the solution, it works fine in colab.
