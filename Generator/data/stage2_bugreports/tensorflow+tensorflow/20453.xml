	<summary>Tensorflow Lite adds unnecessary permissions.</summary>
	<description>
When using Tensorflow Lite 0.17.0, it adds android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE and android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE because no min sdk was specified.
I suggest to hotfix and release this ASAP because it's adding these permissions to apps that don't need them.
Here is the log from the manifest merger:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;uses-permission#android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE
IMPLIED from /home/ph1b/Dev/Yazio/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:2:1-165:12 reason: org.tensorflow.lite has a targetSdkVersion &lt; 4
uses-permission#android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
IMPLIED from /home/ph1b/Dev/Yazio/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:2:1-165:12 reason: org.tensorflow.lite requested WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I don't think the form has anything necessary that my bugreport hasn't.
