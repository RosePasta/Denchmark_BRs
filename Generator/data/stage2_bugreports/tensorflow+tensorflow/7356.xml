	<summary>Potential UnboundLocalError in error-handling context manager</summary>
	<description>
I'm working on unrelated things while this came up, and it's possibly unlikely to happen in real development, but just to track it in case someone cares,



tensorflow/tensorflow/python/framework/errors_impl.py


         Line 471
      in
      5e5dc97






 pywrap_tensorflow.TF_DeleteStatus(status) 





that is an UnboundLocalError if it was line 463 that raised there (i.e. if TF_NewStatus failed entirely).
Without any insider knowledge, possibly that line belongs outside the try block.

		Nice catch, thank you!  I'll fix, unless you feel like submitting a PR.
