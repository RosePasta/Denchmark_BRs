	<summary>Links to windows builds in os setup documentation are bad</summary>
	<description>
Build location is listed under &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation-on-windows&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation-on-windows&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For example when trying to retrieve:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I get the response
&lt;Error&gt;
   &lt;Code&gt;NoSuchKey&lt;/Code&gt;
   &lt;Message&gt;The specified key does not exist.&lt;/Message&gt;
&lt;/Error&gt;

		It looks like the website was updated before the new packages were pushed. In the meantime, you can find a valid PIP package here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(...but the next RC will have a lot of bug fixes, so it's probably worth checking back!)

		The link you provided seems the same as the invalid one I listed, I assume you were meaning to link to an older build?

		Oops, sorry about that. Here's the correct link:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		That does the trick, thanks. BTW I really appreciate the work to get windows support. :)

		The 0.12.0rc1 links from &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#pip_installation_on_windows&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#pip_installation_on_windows&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should be working now. Please give it another try. Thanks!
