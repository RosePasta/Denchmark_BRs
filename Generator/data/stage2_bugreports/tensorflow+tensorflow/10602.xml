	<summary>TensorBoard:  enable text-selection (for copy/paste) of tf.summary.text items</summary>
	<description>
The way tensorboard is currently implemented seems to prevent one from selecting (in a web browser) the text of tf.summary.text summaries.  It would be nice if it were possible to copy/paste such text.

 Do you know what the problem might be?

		This is easy to fix; there's a user-select: none that should be overridden by the text dashboard.
I've migrated this to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/33&gt;tensorflow/tensorboard#33&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and should be able to fix it soon. :-)
