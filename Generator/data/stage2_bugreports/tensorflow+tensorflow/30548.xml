System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.14
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):

Describe the current behavior
I have a variable stored in a ckpt called prsr/prior/conv1/weights and i want to do a map assignment to a variable called prsr/prior/conv1/weights_1:0. When I execute the init_from_checkpoint execution it gives the following error

ValueError: Assignment map with scope only name prsr/prior/conv1 should map to scope only prsr/prior/conv1/weights. Should be 'scope/': 'other_scope/'.

Describe the expected behavior
I think it should assigned correctly the variable from the .ckpt prsr/prior/conv1/weights into the current variable prsr/prior/conv1/weights_1:0 as indicated in the API official documentation:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Initialize partitioned variables using variable's name
init_from_checkpoint('/tmp/model.ckpt',
                     {'old_scope_2/var3': 'new_scope_2/var3'})
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Sorry for the delay. I think I found the issue myself and it was my fault. Thanks for the response nonetheless.
