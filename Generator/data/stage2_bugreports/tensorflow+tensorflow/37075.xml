		It seems this could be closed since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/36817&gt;#36817&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is merged

  I was told that many users use windows where pip3 is not required and python3 too. For them pip and python do the work so i closed my PR. If you suggest me to do the changes, i'll do it.

 oops, I thought the PR was merged. In my opinion there are many cases where python is default aliased to python3, so I think there's no need to explicitly speficy to use python3 instead of python..

		Yes. So you may consider closing this issue. Could you suggest me some issues to work on? I am a GSOC 2020 aspirant and looking forward to work with Tensorflow.

		Sorry I can't help you. I'm also interested in GSOC 2020 and now wandering around in the issues.
