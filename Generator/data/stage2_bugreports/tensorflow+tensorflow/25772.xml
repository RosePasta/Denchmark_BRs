	<summary>Unable to set estimator.model_dir after estimator initialization</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;System information:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Tensorflow version: 1.9.0 (installed from binary)
Python version: 3.6.8
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Setting the value of estimator.model_dir after the estimator has already been created does not work.  I specifically want to set the value of this after initialization, but only see a way to set it during initialization.  Is there a reason that tensorflow does not support setting the model_dir after estimator creation? If not, is there a viable workaround?
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Source code:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;classifier = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(
    feature_columns=some_feature_classifier,
    hidden_units=[10, 10],
    n_classes=3)
# other code...
classifier.model_dir = "/tmp/model_dir_file"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Error message:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
File "&lt;stdin&gt;" in &lt;module&gt;
----&gt; 1 classifier.model_dir = "/tmp/model_dir_file"

AttributeError: can't set attribute
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thank you!

		It is a variable in DNNClassfier's super class Estimator but not DNNClassifier. Hence you cannot access it through DNNClassifier. Moreover, these API's are all deprecated and you might want to consider migrating to the new ones.

		As suggested by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sayan-Paul&gt;@Sayan-Paul&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Could you use newer Tensorflow version and test your model? Thanks!

		Hmm, I tried running the same code in my original post with Tensorflow 1.12.0, and received the same error message when trying to set classifier.model_dir to some other value. Should I be setting this variable through the super class?
Thanks!

		The class DNNClassifier is deprecated so you should use the new estimator module which is at a different location tf.estimator. In the new one, you can give the model_dir as a parameter of `Estimator`.
