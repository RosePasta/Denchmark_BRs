	<summary>[Bug] Silent memory failure</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes (see below)
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Lubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.7.0-3-g024aecf414 1.7.0
Python version: Python 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version:  Driver Version: 390.30 CUDA Driver Version = 9.1
GPU model and memory: NVidia GTX 1080Ti (11Go)
Exact command to reproduce: copy paste the given code and call the only function (if running on a  GPU with different memory please fiddle with the size of the arrays accordingly)

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When run on GPU the program runs fine except results are silently zeroed for elements in the last 25% of result. It only happens when I it uses a lot of memory but instead of failing it tries to compute and silently mess the results.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
def bugTensorflow():
    #bug with GTX 1080 Ti
    #Lubuntu 16.04
    #Driver Version: 390.30
    #CUDA Driver Version = 9.1
    nbpoints1 = 100000
    nbpoints2 = 4000
    dim = 3

    #works fine on cpu and bugs on second gpu as well
    #with tf.device("/cpu:0"):
    #with tf.device("/gpu:1"):

    with tf.device("/gpu:0"):
        points = tf.random_normal( (nbpoints1,1,dim) )
        traj = tf.random_normal((1,nbpoints2,dim) )
        diff= points-traj
        dist = tf.reduce_sum( diff*diff,axis=-1)
    sess = tf.Session()
    with(sess.as_default()):
        _dist = sess.run(dist)
        print("dist.shape")
        print(dist.shape)
        print("dist[0]")
        print(_dist[0])
        print("dist[75000]")
        print(_dist[75000])
        print("tensorflow version")
        print(tf.__version__)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Results :

dist.shape
(100000, 4000)
dist[0]
[ 3.918147   8.78706    3.0947132 ...  0.8662497  0.6857513 11.894537 ]
dist[75000]
[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
tensorflow version
1.7.0

 Damn humans are so lazy, you need to nagg harder :) otherwise they will never give you rights. You can start by CC'ing their bosses, or take money from them. That usually do the trick.
