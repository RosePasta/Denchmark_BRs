	<summary>tf.function runtime error when modifying file</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Arch Linux
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-2828-ga9a1a64d25 2.0.0-dev20190528
Python version: 3.6.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA version 10.0.130
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1080 Ti

Describe the current behavior
I'm running some experiments using tensorflow 2.0 nightly. I decorated the train step with @tf.function. In the meantime I'm modifying the file involved in the training.
After some time I get a random error in a function invocation (inside the function decorated with tf.function. If I do not modify any file the error does not happen.
I guess it's something related to the implementation of @tf.function, probably tf.function creates some temp file and updates them. The file update however is not managed well since modifying files the training should not be affected.
Code to reproduce the issue
This is an issue difficult to reproduce.

		It's difficult to tell, but unlikely.

 could you include the error message (redacted is fine, the type and parts of the error message would be helpful). Also, could you try to see if the error reproduces with ?
