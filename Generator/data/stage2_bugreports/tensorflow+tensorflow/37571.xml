System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): using conda
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0
Python version: 3.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from
source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1.243 / 7.6.5
GPU model and memory: Tesla T4 16GB

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: An op outside of the function building code is being passed
a "Graph" tensor. It is possible to have Graph tensors
leak out of the function building context by including a
tf.init_scope in your function building code.
For example, the following function will fail:
  @tf.function
  def has_init_scope():
    my_constant = tf.constant(1.)
    with tf.init_scope():
      added = my_constant * 2
The graph tensor has name: Dec_VAE_VDraw_Var/Identity:0

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
...
_SymbolicException: Inputs to eager execution function cannot be Keras symbolic tensors, but found [&lt;tf.Tensor 'Dec_VAE_VDraw_Var/Identity:0' shape=(None, 128) dtype=float32&gt;, &lt;tf.Tensor 'Dec_VAE_VDraw_Mean/Identity:0' shape=(None, 128) dtype=float32&gt;]

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When i didn't use mirrored strategy and added experimental_tf_function = False as an argument to model.compile, the errors were not raised.
It would be glad if you would help me to solve this errors.

I know that google colab does not support multiple gpus. Does mirrored strategy work on one gpu?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Crispy13&gt;@Crispy13&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, yes you can run MirroredStrategy with one GPU in colab and for this scenario I think we should be able to reproduce the error. If you are still facing this issue, please provide a colab notebook so we can help troubleshoot.
