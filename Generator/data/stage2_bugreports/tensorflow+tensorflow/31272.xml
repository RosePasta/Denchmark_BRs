	<summary>[TF2] UnicodeDecodeError when using tf.saved_model.save</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes.
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version: 2.0.0-dev20190731
Python version: 3.6.7
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: GTX 1080 Ti

Describe the current behavior
Code crashes with following exception:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "mwe.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;

UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 68: invalid start byte
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This seems to be a regression; I was running code I had working ago some weeks/months with earlier TF2 nightlies, and this appears to me as unexpected behavior.
Might be introduced by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7cc180f107f142432358ac33787466de90afd776&gt;7cc180f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To me,   seems incorrect, since  can return arbitrary binary data (&lt;denchmark-link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial#parsing-and-serialization&gt;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial#parsing-and-serialization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 "Note that the bytes are binary, not text; we only use the str type as a convenient container."), decodability into UTF-8 cannot be guaranteed. This bug might have gone unnoticed, as many other serializations just happen to be be UTF-8 decodable â€¦
Describe the expected behavior
A properly saved model.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras as keras

input_ = keras.layers.Input((None, None, None), dtype='float32')

output = tf.image.extract_patches(input_, sizes=(1,128,128,1), strides=(1,128,128,1), rates=(1,1,1,1), padding='VALID')

model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_], outputs=[output])

tf.saved_model.save(model, '/tmp/model')

		I was able to reproduce the error with TF 2.0 beta1 and nightly.

		This seems to have been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/39bc7bcf94983261a3ee8a72802f5de056728a9c&gt;39bc7bc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
