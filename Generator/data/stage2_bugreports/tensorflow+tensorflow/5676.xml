	<summary>UnicodeDecodeError when reading from tfrecords</summary>
	<description>
All I'm really trying to do is read a large array from a tfrecords file. I can do it so long that it's below a 8million ints but above that I get a unicode error, which doesn't seem to make much sense to me. Also, it worth noting that this script works using r0.9. I have about 64GB of ram on my computer so I doubt it's a memory issue.

None

Operating System:
Linux Mint 18 Sarah (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-47-generic x86_64)
Installed version of CUDA and cuDNN:
not installed
If installed from binary pip package, provide:


A link to the pip package you installed:

The output from python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)".
python -c "import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.version)"


&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

dim_size = 9000000

# Create the array
array = np.zeros([dim_size], dtype=int)

example = tf.train.Example(
    features = tf.train.Features(
        feature = {
            'array': tf.train.Feature(
                bytes_list= tf.train.BytesList(value=[array.tostring()])
            )
        }
    )
)

# Write the example to disk
writer = tf.python_io.TFRecordWriter('temp.tfrecords')
writer.write(example.SerializeToString())
writer.close()

# Define input pipeline
queue = tf.train.string_input_producer(['temp.tfrecords'], shuffle=False, num_epochs=1)
reader = tf.TFRecordReader()
_, se = reader.read(queue)

#Define the parsed dict
parsed = tf.parse_single_example(
    serialized=se,
    features={
        "array":tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
    }
)

# Decode the example
tens = tf.decode_raw(parsed['array'], tf.int64)

# Define the init op.
init_op = tf.group(
    tf.initialize_all_variables(),
    tf.initialize_local_variables()
)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)
    # Define coordinator and threads
    coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(coord=coord, sess=sess)

    # Run the reading operation
    print sess.run([tens])
    coord.request_stop()
    coord.join(threads)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What other attempted solutions have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This works using r0.9 and it also works if you lower the dim_size below 800000. So it seems to be an issue with the size and r0.11. I also get the same results if I use a float array as opposed to an int.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs or other output that would be helpful&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 Should we be escaping strings in error messages?  I vaguely recall having part of that discussion before.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CRSilkworth&gt;@CRSilkworth&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 The unicode error is secondary.  Your immediate problem is the  error.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martinwicke&gt;@martinwicke&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Is this the dreaded protobuf limit?  The error is from 
.

 Yes, I think we should be escaping strings here. I don't remember what the outcome of the earlier discussion was (in particular, where the encoding should happen) but it seems like we use  in a few kernels, so perhaps we should use it here?

		Did we ever determine if the real issue is this protobuf limit? Am I able to avoid this some how or will I have to revert back to 0.9?

		I don't know why there would be a difference between 0.9 and 0.11 then.
Otherwise it looks plausible. Sadly the real error is hidden by the Unicode
problem. Did you install the &gt;64MB version of protobuf? Assuming that that
is used and nothing else (hard to tell), the limit shouldn't trigger at 8M
ints.

		Hmm I'm not sure if my protobuf version is &gt; 64MB, I just installed the one that tensorflow as a dependency (protobuf==3.0.0).
Is there anything I can do to help out in tracking this down?

		<comment id='8' author='CRSilkworth' date='2016-12-07T17:24:38Z'>
		There's a protobuf version on our website with the 64MB limit removed:

Can you try installing one of those packages? Make sure to uninstall protobuf beforehand.

		Replicated only part of the error in python3:

```
with open('temp.tfrecords', 'rb') as v:
    s = v.read()
z = tf.parse_single_example(serialized=s, features={

        "array":tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
    })
s = tf.Session()
s.run(z)
```

returns

		That said, running:


returns

DecodeError: Unexpected end-group tag.

in other words, looks like the proto is invalid once written?  weird.
 looks like an error by the TFRecordWriter?

this works just fine:

```
sess.run(
  tf.parse_single_example(serialized=example.SerializeToString(),
    features={

        "array":tf.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
    })
```

so looks like the issue is somewhere in the TFRecordWriter or
TFRecordReader.
