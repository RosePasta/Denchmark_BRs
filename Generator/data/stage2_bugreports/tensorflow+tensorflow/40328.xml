	<summary>Subclassed model with ConvLSTM2D layer can't be saved as a SavedModel in TF2.2</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): custom code, extended an example from TF guides
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04/Mac OS 10.15
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1 and 2.2
Python version: 3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: 1080Ti 11Gb

Describe the current behavior
As a header states the model build with Subclassing API with ConvLSTM2D layer inside can't be saved as a SavedModel. Given that keras (.h5) model format doesn't support saving subclassed models I am left with no option to save the model architecture to file.
The issues appears in TF2.2 while there seems to be no bug in earlier version 2.1
Describe the expected behavior
The code is to work without issues in both TF2.2 and TF2.1
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

		Was able to reproduce the issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/2da837292cbfa01854fa77f2d2791d15/40328.ipynb&gt;TF v2.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/6dbb8421ea8815a3c1a41110969c7d6a/40328-tf-nightly.ipynb#scrollTo=S8MN8xgvnjdw&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Works without any issues with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/cb19b976d100df61f01d41e17d2180d0/40328-2-1.ipynb&gt;TF v2.1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please find the attached gist. Thanks!
