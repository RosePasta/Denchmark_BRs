	<summary>Problem loading model trained with EfficientNetB0</summary>

System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 20.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.0
Python version: 3.6.9
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.2
GPU model and memory: GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with Max-Q Design 6 GB

Describe the current behavior
Error using tensorflow.keras.applications EfficientNetB0.
When I load my trained model, I have the following warnings (I only copied part of them here, you can check the rest in the colab link that is below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING:tensorflow:Importing a function (__inference_block2a_activation_layer_call_and_return_conditional_losses_344566) with ops with custom gradients. Will likely fail if a gradient is requested.
WARNING:tensorflow:Importing a function (__inference_block2a_activation_layer_call_and_return_conditional_losses_344566) with ops with custom gradients. Will likely fail if a gradient is requested.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I basically save the model and load it again in the colab link below and I get this message.
Because of this I cannot continue training my model if I wish to do so. Am I missing something here?

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
I am basically using the same code from here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_efficientnet_fine_tuning/&gt;https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_efficientnet_fine_tuning/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

for the colab example. Am I doing something wrong?

		I switched from activation="swish" (default) to activation="relu" and the problem was gone. Now I don't know why this happens while using swish.

		I was able to reproduce the issue in colab. Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/e060bc6ed459d44c31121d0a1684e962/untitled398.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes, I think it is related to that.
So there's no solution right now for this problem?
Thank you!
