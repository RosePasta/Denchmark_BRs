Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): TF2.0 Alpha
Python version: 3.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
Describe the current behavior
The loss value returned from Keras.Model.evaluate() is an arithmetic average over losses for each batch. However, when the last batch has a smaller batch size than previous batches (e.g. a dataset has 101 examples, with batch-size=10), the calculation is incorrect because it will mistakenly give higher weight to the last batch's loss.
Describe the expected behavior
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
