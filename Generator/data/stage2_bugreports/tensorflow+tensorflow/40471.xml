	<summary>Equal function forgets static shape in graph-mode in tensorflow 2.1 and 2.2</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): official pipy wheel
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.2.0-rc4-8-g2b96f3662b 2.2.0
Python version: 3.7.6

Describe the current behavior
In graph-mode when x.shape == [None, 10, 1], y.shape == [None, 1, 4] then one would expect (x==y).shape to be [None, 10, 4]. This really works in tensorflow 2.0. In tensorflow 2.1 and 2.2 it is a completely undefined shape.
Describe the expected behavior
The same behaviour as in tensorflow 2.0.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec([None, 10, 1]), tf.TensorSpec([None, 1, 4])])
def fun(x, y):
    z = x == y
    tf.print("z.shape =", z.shape)
    return z

fun(tf.ones([5, 10, 1]), tf.ones([5, 1, 4]));
In tensorflow 2.0, this code prints z.shape = TensorShape([None, 10, 4]).
In tensorflow 2.2 and 2.1, this code prints z.shape = TensorShape(None).

		I have tried in colab with TF version 2.1, 2.2 and was able to reproduce the issue.Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/cf487e179e38859d2301e11969b41bbb/untitled25.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
