	<summary>gather_nd bounds checking not working</summary>
	<description>
When using gather_nd, sometimes out-of-bounds indices lead to errors (bounds checking -- the expected behavior) and sometimes it seems to just read zeros. I expect it reading just other memory from the GPU, but I've never observed anything other than zeros so I'm not sure. When I run on the CPU the bounds seem to be appropriately checked i.e. I get the errors desired. Here's some example code:
import tensorflow as tf
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(tf.gather_nd(tf.zeros([5,5,5]) + 1, [[6,6,6]])))
print(sess.run(tf.gather_nd(tf.zeros([1,5]) + 1, [-50000000000000000])))
print(sess.run(tf.gather_nd(tf.reshape(tf.range(5*5*5), [5,5,5]), [[6,6,6]])))
The first two print statements execute successfully, which is a bug: the indices are clearly out of range, and the arrays are clearly all 1's; but instead it returns an appropriately shaped array of 0's. (The +1 is not necessary to trigger the bug, but highlights that it's drawing from incorrect memory). The third line, for some reason, has the bounds checking operate correctly, and says that -- yes -- the index [6,6,6] is not in the bounds. It appears to something based on what the previous op is, maybe? Where some ops, such as stack, allow me to go outside the bounds, while others such as reshape don't. Here's an example interactive session to show the output I get.

		Any array bounds checking issues would involve digging into the C++, or maybe even the GPU kernel.  That's beyond what I can do.

		It looks like relevant bounds-checking code for the CPU is in 


tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/gather_nd_op_cpu_impl.h


         Line 57
      in
      dff1062






 bool out_of_bounds = false; 




 The 'out_of_bounds' variable gets stored in 'error_loc' and then passed out as 'bad_i' in 


tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/gather_nd_op.cc


         Line 126
      in
      e073322






 bad_i = func(c-&gt;eigen_device&lt;Device&gt;(), slice_size, scratch_scalar, \ 





But based on L144 in gather_nd_op.cc, it seems that the GPU kernel is currently not designed to do the bounds checking.



tensorflow/tensorflow/core/kernels/gather_nd_op_gpu.cu.cc


         Line 56
      in
      e073322






 out[i] = (out_of_bounds) ? T(0) : ldg(params + offset + loc_offset); 




 shows that it deliberately returns an all-zero tensors when the bounds check fails, but doesn't report the error. L91 says something about it requiring CPU/GPU communication that I honestly don't understand. I figure this will be a #dontfix for now then? :|

		The issue and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12405&gt;#12405&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seems both similar with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/13687&gt;#13687&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which requests a bound checking for GPU . cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ebrevdo&gt;@ebrevdo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

It's hard to efficiently check an error condition coming off the GPU
gather_nd does in a similar case. Want to send a PR to update the documentation for those two
