System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 42c4f4ab6b53bce8639c203d7839d27eac11bd2f
Python version: 3.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.21.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10
CUDA/cuDNN version: 9.0 / 7
GPU model and memory: 8x GTX 1080 Ti 12GB

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
No leaking platform/logging.h and no those warnings about redefining glog macros.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
#include &lt;glog/logging.h&gt;
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"

int main() {
    tensorflow::SessionOptions gpu_option;
}
export TF_INC_DIR=/tmp/tensorflow/execroot/org_tensorflow/bazel-out/k8-opt/genfiles/tensorflow/include
g++ bug.cc -std=c++11 -I$TF_INC_DIR -I$TF_INC_DIR/external/com_google_absl
Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
I know TensorFlow has tried to avoid leaking the logging macros (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7480&gt;#7480&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/42c4f4ab6b53bce8639c203d7839d27eac11bd2f/tensorflow/core/lib/core/refcount.h&gt;core/lib/core/refcount.h&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is leaking them again. It seems that one way to fix it is to remove  from the headers and add them back in the  files. However, as said in , those are "Inlined routines, since these are performance critical" thus cannot be moved to a  file. But I'm sure there must be a way to stop leaking the logging macros.
