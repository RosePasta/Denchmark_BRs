	<summary>Relations/differences between Container and Scopes in Context Manager are not Clear</summary>
	<description>
From respective docs
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/container&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/container&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/VariableScope&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/VariableScope&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The relation between these two context manager is not clear (although variable scope and name scope inter-relation are fine).
But from the source code ones can see that they are clearly two things that inter-relates but not the same thing.
Should i use Container only in the eager mode ? why not use only variable scope or name scope instead? also, maybe other questions will come as people uses low-level API to specialize in tensorflow dev.
So i think its an Issue.
Thankyou
