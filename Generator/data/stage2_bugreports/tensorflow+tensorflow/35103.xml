Python version: Python 3.6.8
Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?: pip. This is in a virtualenv environment though.

Describe the problem
Running tf_upgrade_v2 on a file that has async functions causes it to crash.
Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem

		Here is the command I ran: tf_upgrade_v2 --infile test_tf.py --outfile test_tf_v2.py . The contents of the test_tf.py are the same as I posted above:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;async def f():
    return
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It also crashed when I tested with a file containing more code (same command) :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from image_classification import image_classify as ic

tf_sess = None
classifications = None


def start_tf():
    global tf_sess
    global classifications
    classifications = ic.get_classifications()
    if tf_sess is not None:
        print("TensorFlow session already exists")
        return "TensorFlow session already exists"
    tf_sess = ic.main()
    return "started TensorFlow session"


def stop_tf():
    global tf_sess
    global classifications
    tf_sess.close()  # free resources used by the tf session
    tf_sess = None  # remove the reference to it
    classifications = None
    print("ended TensorFlow session")
    return "ended TensorFlow session"


async def classify_attachment(message, tf_sess, classifications):
    if classifications is None:
        return "image classifications not found"
    if tf_sess is None:
        return "TensorFlow session not found"
    if len(message.attachments) == 0:
        return "no valid attachments in message"

    # check image using image-classification
    attachment = message.attachments[0]
    print("message contains attachment at:{0}".format(attachment.url))
    img = await attachment.read()
    result = ic.classify_image(img, tf_sess, classifications)
    return (result, attachment)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

, Looks like  is not defined and tensorflow import is missing. Please provide the more information to reproduce the issue. Thanks!

		I don't have access to my computer right now, but the specific code that caused the issue is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TheBicPen/bic-bot-py/tree/master/image_classification&gt;https://github.com/TheBicPen/bic-bot-py/tree/master/image_classification&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . The command I ran was . I ran this command from the root of the repo. Additionally, the  file that I used to try to isolate the issue is located here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TheBicPen/bic-bot-py/blob/master/test/test_tf.py&gt;https://github.com/TheBicPen/bic-bot-py/blob/master/test/test_tf.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I hope this information is enough to reproduce the issue

		This is an issue in google_pasta, a library we use to write that script in. This is fixed as shown in the following &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26486#issuecomment-497027128&gt;comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Lets make things clear here. If you use pasta 0.1.8 are you still facing the issue in Manjaro Linux?

		I am facing the same issue with pasta 0.1.8 on Windows. I haven't checked yet on Manjaro.

		Initially the issue has been created for Manjaro Linux So, lets stick to that for now. If you are looking into windows, please create a new issue for windows. Thanks!

I had a hardware change over the holidays so I only have a Windows machine now. I'll spin up a Manjaro VM tonight, but I'm pretty sure that the same issue occurs across both platforms.
