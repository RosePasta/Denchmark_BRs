	<summary>[Docs] "arg_scope" overrides "defined in" paths</summary>
	<description>
I found that some ops have incorrect "defined in" paths in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers&gt;contrib.layers docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Examples: avg_pool2d, batch_norm, bias_add, conv2d, conv2d_in_plane, conv2d_transpose, dropout, flatten, fully_connected, layer_norm, one_hot_encoding, separable_conv2d, softmax
It always uses &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.1/tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/arg_scope.py&gt;tensorflow/contrib/framework/python/ops/arg_scope.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which is clearly outright wrong.
This seems to be the case for all ops defined in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py&gt;tensorflow/contrib/layers/python/layers/layers.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which are annotated with

 Our friend has identified has at least thirteen functions in contrib where the "defined in" link needs to be updated.

		I don't own the tool that generates these; reassigning to Mark to take a look.
