	<summary>Broken link in "A Tool Developer's Guide..." for graph_metrics.py</summary>
	<description>
Here is the link for  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/how_tos/tool_developers/index.html#graphdef&gt;this tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but it's broken:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorfl%0Aow/python/tools/graph_metrics.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorfl%0Aow/python/tools/graph_metrics.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Update:
Just found other links to the files, such as freeze_graph() and tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.proto also not working.

		Thanks for the report! I'd accidentally added new-lines to some URLs when I was formatting the markdown to an 80-column width, but I've just pushed a fix internally. This bug should be updated automatically once the change goes in, and then the website should get a push soon after that.

		Actually I rolled back my internal change since it looks like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1174&gt;#1174&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 / &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1175&gt;#1175&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fix this and we don't want merging conflicts. Closing this bug.
