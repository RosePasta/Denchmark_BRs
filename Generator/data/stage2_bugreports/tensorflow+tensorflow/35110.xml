There is an error when trying to converting .pb that build from tensorflow speech recognition freeze.py file for my own custom data.
This is the used code for conversion.

from tensorflow import lite

graph_def_file = "conv.pb"

It would be helpful if you could inform us of how this conversion went by opening a github issue at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new?template=40-tflite-op-request.md
 and pasting the following:

Some of the operators in the model are not supported by the standard TensorFlow Lite runtime. If those are native TensorFlow operators, you might be able to use the extended runtime by passing --enable_select_tf_ops, or by setting target_ops=TFLITE_BUILTINS,SELECT_TF_OPS when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Otherwise, if you have a custom implementation for them you can disable this error with --allow_custom_ops, or by setting allow_custom_ops=True when calling tf.lite.TFLiteConverter(). Here is a list of builtin operators you are using: CONV_2D, FULLY_CONNECTED, MAX_POOL_2D, RESHAPE, SOFTMAX. Here is a list of operators for which you will need custom implementations: AudioSpectrogram, DecodeWav, Mfcc.

Also, please include a link to a GraphDef or the model if possible.
Any other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		You may try converting the model using TFLITE_BUILTINS ,SELECT_TF_OPS options.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_select#converting_the_model&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/ops_select#converting_the_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
