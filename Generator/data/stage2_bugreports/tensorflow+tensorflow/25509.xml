	<summary>[tf.data] non-used attributes in some tf.data operation definitions</summary>
	<description>
Some attributes in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/dataset_ops.cc&gt;tf.data operation definition&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (e.g. , , ) do not seem to be used in other places.
Taken &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/dataset_ops.cc#L339-L340&gt;RangeDataset&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as an example, the  and  are required, but these attributes are not used in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/range_dataset_op.cc&gt;range_dataset_op.cc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I wouldn't be surprised if these were used in shape inference when iterating over the Dataset. But someone who works on tf.data would know better.

 Thanks for your explanation. It makes sense if these attributes were used in shape inference.

 If you could confirm it, I will close this issue.

		These attrs are not used for shape inference. It is possible that these attrs were used before, but the internal implementation of datasets has since changed such that the attrs aren't used in the kernels. Because of TF compatibility guarantees, the OpDefs can't be changed to remove them, and we have no plans to remove the unused attrs. Furthermore, these attrs are actually referenced in some optimizations, such as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/data/map_vectorization.cc#L135&gt;map_vectorization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
