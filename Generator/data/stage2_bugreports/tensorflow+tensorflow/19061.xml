	<summary>Tensorflow serving pages missing on deploy page</summary>
	<description>
From the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/&gt;TensorFlow Deploy page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the links for TensorFlow serving all give 404 page not found errors.
For example, try the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/setup&gt;Installation page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For example, try the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/serving_basic&gt;Serving a TensorFlow Model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
