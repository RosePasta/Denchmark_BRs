	<summary>Type error occurring in the input pipeline should give more descriptive error messages than "RandomShuffleQueue is closed and has insufficient elements"</summary>
	<description>
I don't have a particular code example, but I had the case that a tf.py_func node returned the wrong data type and thus caused the queue to stall. It was impossible to tell what the error was from the error messages that TensorFlow produced. What is the reason that there are no error messages about type mismatches?

		It would be very helpful if you could create a reproducible test case. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ebrevdo&gt;@ebrevdo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, do you have any idea on this anyways?
