		Looks like  the error goes away when the workpspace memory size is increased.   Wondering, if the native segment fallback  works well transparently.  Preliminary observation is that it does not.

		Please, provide simple standalone code, then it is easy for localizing the issue faster. Thanks again.!

		That is easier said than done, when dealing with complex networks.  As a general observation, it is  not possible to create a sample code for every issue.   A  suggestion  would be to collect more metrics,  and log more and better  traces.  Most other complex pieces  of software uses such techniques rather than relying on  samples codes from developers.

 as you said please try to increase the workspace size. Also &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pooyadavoodi&gt;@pooyadavoodi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
If it fails to build the engine, the fallback should work transparently. If not please reopen or file another issue.
