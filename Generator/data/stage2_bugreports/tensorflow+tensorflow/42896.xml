	<summary>Documentation is becoming too undecipherable for a meaningful practical work</summary>
	<description>
The documentation is becoming too undecipherable for any practical applications using Tensorflow.
Look at this one, &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

How would anyone learn anything for a streaming data from Disk ? Not many how-tos for data that don't fit into memory. And that page.. just like a man-page for API. We end up wasting many man hours without good documentation.

?

		Can you send PRs to fix documentation? This is an evolving process, we try to get documentation that is as useful as possible to as many people as possible.
