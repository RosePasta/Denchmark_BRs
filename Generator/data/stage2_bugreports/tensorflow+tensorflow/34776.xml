&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/StackedRNNCells&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/StackedRNNCells&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Documentation example does not actually use StackedRNNCells. There is no example for the class being documented. Ideally there would be both an example of the class and an example showing how the same behaviour would be implemented without the class.
