	<summary>Convert TensorFlow to TensorFlow Lite - very small model after conversion</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Colab
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source): 2.3.0

Following my previous issues &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/44091&gt;#44091&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/44435&gt;#44435&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of converting the Tensorflow model to Tensorflow Lite I prepared a notebook inspired by the notebook from the link &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sayakpaul/E2E-Object-Detection-in-TFLite/blob/master/Object_Detection_in_TFLite.ipynb&gt;Object_Detection_in_TFLite&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. From notebook  we can see that after converting model  &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/TF-2.0-Hacks/blob/master/Training_a_pets_detector_model_within_minutes_with_TFOD_API.ipynb&gt;Training a pets detector model within minutes with TFOD API&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to TFLite the model size is 5711632 Bytes. In my cases the size of model is 516 bytes &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GYKWFR7A6WknexnFa312eCa3ZST58i_3?usp=sharing&gt;mobilenet_v2_to_tflite&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Where Is the problem? I try to convert the model up to a month and the results are always the same. Model size is around 500 bytes. I thought it was a bug due to the fact that there is something wrong with training the model but I can see that even for the standard model with the repository the error is the same.

,
I was able to reproduce the issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/a060a9cf582e283a38ba647000f2ee02/44561.ipynb&gt;TF v2.3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
However, the issue seems to be fixed with the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/5e8c0f4835547183cb6629a2facde125/44561-tf-nightly.ipynb#scrollTo=cohE9r5hfI1C&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. On converting the model, the size of the  file is around 11 MB. Please check the linked gist for reference. Thanks!

 Thank you for your help !!! So far the results are the same. For model graph and tflite frozen graph. Now I will want to run the model on google coral. But first I need to quantization. We'll see if there will be any more problems
