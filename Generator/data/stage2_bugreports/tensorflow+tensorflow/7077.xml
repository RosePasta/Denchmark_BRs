using the current HEAD of tensorflow, I have bumped into an issue when I execute tensorboard.

I see the werkzeug.BUILD file on my system so not sure why it cannot be found.

		Just to be clear, you ran configure, built the whl file, installed, and running from there?
/cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dandelionmane&gt;@dandelionmane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 also lists werkzeug, so it's not clear why pip installing the package would not install werkzeug too.

		Sorry,
I ran configure and use TensorFlow from source, but don't build the whl, I am setup for "Setting up TensorFlow for Development".  So I use the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# To build with GPU support:
bazel build -c opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

mkdir _python_build
cd _python_build 
ln -s ../bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package.runfiles/org_tensorflow/* .
ln -s ../tensorflow/tools/pip_package/* .
python setup.py develop
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I am not super familiar with that style of development: I don't know why calling the setup.py with 'develop' mode doesn't install the required packages.
You should be able to get around this by pip install werkzeug manually.

		I can try the PIP but a little concerned it might cause problems later as the PIP should be bundled with the development install.
Here is the link to the "setting up with TensorFlow for Development":
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#setting_up_tensorflow_for_development&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#setting_up_tensorflow_for_development&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

EDIT: That did fix the error but unsure why we need to manually install via "pip"

		If you are concerned about polluting your environment, you should run virtualenv. We need werkzeug to run.

		I understand, but wanted to report the break in the current HEAD development build.  This is the first include I have needed to PIP install that appears it should have been installed with bazel.  My only concern is I will not be able to detect when it is corrected in the future.

		<comment id='8' author='Mazecreator' date='2017-01-26T19:02:56Z'>
		Right, we are thinking that setup.py should have installed it, but for some reason didn't. Is it working for you now?
		</comment>
		<comment id='9' author='Mazecreator' date='2017-01-26T19:15:40Z'>
		Yes, I will remove the PIP package once you guys determine how to move forward as you could add the package as a prerequisite.

		<comment id='10' author='Mazecreator' date='2017-01-26T19:25:19Z'>
		Yes, it looks like it's a documentation issue. According to &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28509965/setuptools-development-requirements&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the  mode doesn't install the requirements. You have to install them separately. Closing a looping internally to update the doc.

		I also encountered the same problem, but I found the werkzeug package. But still did not solve the problem

		I have the same problem with TwistedW ,and still did not solve,too.

		I have the same problem and pip install does not solve it.

		This is strictly a TB dependency.
You should reach out to tensorboard to look into fixing this dependency in tensorboard pip package.
