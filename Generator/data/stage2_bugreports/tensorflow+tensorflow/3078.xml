	<summary>Allow use of gitter.im for tensorflow/tensorflow repo</summary>
	<description>
As far as I could tell, there is no place for the community to discuss tensorflow in realtime; the recommendations all seem to be about asking specific questions in a detailed async fashion.
It would be nice if there was a gitter.im or IRC channel for tensorflow so that the community could interact more easily. not even as a dedicated support channel.
There is already a gitter.im for skflow, but since fewer people know about skflow, let alone the gitter.im for it, it's pretty small: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gitter.im/tensorflow/skflow&gt;https://gitter.im/tensorflow/skflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It would be even nicer if the channel was linked from the repo, but gitter.im is nice since it has some automatic discoverability if you're already familiar with gitter

		This is a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/132&gt;#132&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and unfortunately our bandwidth is quite limited right now. Things have not changed in terms of our ability to support another official channel of communication, unfortunately.

		Is there a way to have an unofficial but discoverable place for real-time communication? I'm more interested in talking to members of the community than recieving official support.
