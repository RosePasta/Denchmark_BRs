System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Google Colab. Ubuntu 18.04.3
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.15
Python version: 3
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

Describe the current behavior
I'm using tensorflow.keras with TF 1.15 in Colab. I have custom loss function that loads VGG16 from tf.keras and does feature extraction from y_pred and y_true. This feature extraction works if I pass as arguments either y_true or y_pred or any expression without y_true. If I pass expression with y_true and something else it raises error: You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'dense_4_target' with dtype float and shape [?,?,?,?] [[{{node dense_4_target}}]] The same code works when I change tensorflow.keras to just keras.
Describe the expected behavior
Model should compile without errors as in pure Keras

 Looks like we need to supply a numpy array or eager tensor for .
When I changed  to , it worked as expected. Thanks!
As error mentioned, you could create a placeholder and feed the value for the placeholder.
Feel free to close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!
