	<summary>matrix_triangular_solve has broken docstring</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

not applicable (regards documentation)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The docstring of matrix_triangular_solve is not clear, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/matrix_triangular_solve&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/matrix_triangular_solve&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. There are formatting issues, but moreover, it is not immediately clear what the effect of  is. It would be helpful to describe the effect using linear algebra notation.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		What language would you suggest?
Contributions are welcome :) - you'd want to change the string here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/linalg_ops.cc#L430&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/linalg_ops.cc#L430&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

FYI &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rmlarsen&gt;@rmlarsen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in case he has some comments.

		Closing due to inactivity.
BTW the documentation for the op is now here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api/api_def_MatrixTriangularSolve.pbtxt&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api/api_def_MatrixTriangularSolve.pbtxt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
