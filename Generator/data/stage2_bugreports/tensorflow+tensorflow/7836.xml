	<summary>Breaking changes to API</summary>
	<description>
 and  have both changed their API such that you need to switch the  to  parameters. You might want to put a note here (under breaking changes): &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/RELEASE.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/RELEASE.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Incase you want to check here is the API of the two versions of tf:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/nce_loss&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/nce_loss&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Although I do find it odd that tf would simply change the order of these inputs.

 Was this API change intentional?
We might have missed this in our list for 1.0.

. If it's not in the 1.0 release notes that was an oversight, these functions should have been included in the list of functions for which we switched arg order (such as softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits). We can add it to the 1.0 release note section of the release notes.
