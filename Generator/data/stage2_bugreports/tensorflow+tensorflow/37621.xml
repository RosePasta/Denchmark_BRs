GitHub Policy,

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: 3.6.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:10.1

Describe the current behavior
For some specific data, the calculation results of tensorflow and pytorch are inconsistent
Describe the expected behavior
The calculation results of tensorflow and pytorch are consistent or the difference is small
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    if target_interface == 'conv1':
        weights_torch = torch.from_numpy(np.full((11, 11, 3, 1), 1, np.float64).transpose((3, 2, 0, 1)))
        output_pytorch_cpu = torch.from_numpy(
            F.conv2d(torch.from_numpy(input_pytorch.numpy().transpose((0, 3, 1, 2))), weights_torch, padding=0,
                     stride=4).numpy().transpose((0, 2, 3, 1)))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

@lvjunsetup
could you please share the tensorflow version on which the issue was faced for us to replicate this on our local.

Sorry to reply to you so late. The version of tensorflow is 1.90. The error operators are conv2d () and avg_pooling (). Thank you.

Hi @lvjunsetup . Could you please share relevant tensorflow code to reproduce the issue.
Thanks.

This error is a fact, and it can be reproduced by using a large number of random tensors as input to conv2d () or avg_pooling (). Thank you.
