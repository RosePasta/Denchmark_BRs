	<summary>TensorFlow on ARMv7 seems to be slower</summary>
	<description>
I have installed tensorflow on our custom board which is based on i.mx6 (ARMv7) processor. I have compiled the C++ module alone without python support and was able to run the "tensorflow/pi_examples/label_image"
Command used:  make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile HOST_OS=PI TARGET=PI
The problem is that the application seems to be very slow compared to Laptop (Intel i5). The inference takes close to 60-70s while it takes only 0.6 - 0.7s in my Laptop.
After that, I figured out that I missed to use compiler optimization flag to use Neon. I compiled with Neon support and now it takes around 10-17s for same example.
Command used: make -f tensorflow/contrib/makefile/Makefile HOST_OS=PI TARGET=PI  OPTFLAGS="-Os -mfpu=neon -funsafe-math-optimizations -ftree-vectorize"
Is there anything I am missing?

 do these number look reasonable? 20x?

		It's good to see that NEON helps. It's hard to say exactly what performance you should be getting without knowing more about your model, and exactly which i.mx6 chip you're using, but a 10x slowdown on a low-power chip versus a laptop doesn't seem too crazy.

, closing since it looks like you are getting reasonable performance. If you have a more specific issue, let us know.

 Hi, could you please tell me how to cross-compile tensorflow c++ module on i.mx6? Thank you so much!

 Thanks! I successfully ported tensorflow to i.MX6!
But I meet another issue, when I run the benchmark or label_image, it comes out with messages like "E tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1142]", but it also says "Running model succeeded!" at the end. I don't know what it means by "E tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.cc:1142".

, Were you able to see the class label output on the terminal?
