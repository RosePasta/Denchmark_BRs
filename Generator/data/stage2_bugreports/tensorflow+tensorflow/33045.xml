	<summary>TPU support in tensorflow 2.0 release</summary>
	<description>
From the following link &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I understand that TPU training is supported in tensorflow 2.0.
I followed the snippet code provided in the same page:
cluster_resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver(
tpu=tpu_address)
tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(cluster_resolver)
tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(cluster_resolver)
tpu_strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy(cluster_resolver)
And I got the following error:
InvalidArgumentError: Unable to find a context_id matching the specified one (-7989870214237460624). Perhaps the worker was restarted, or the context was GC'd?
Additional GRPC error information:
{"created":"@1570180842.964900283","description":"Error received from peer","file":"external/grpc/src/core/lib/surface/call.cc","file_line":1039,"grpc_message":"Unable to find a context_id matching the specified one (-7989870214237460624). Perhaps the worker was restarted, or the context was GC'd?","grpc_status":3}
Same error was thrown when I didn't provide the tpu_address as it is stated in the above link.

The TPUClusterResolver instance helps locate the TPUs. In Colab, you don't need to specify any arguments to it.

The test was done in google colab and I selected the TPU accelerator. I installed tensorflow-gpu with !pip install tensorflow-gpu.
If TPU is not yet supported in tf 2.0 when it is planed to be added?

  The code can be found at the following link: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CfY-bW-sRjZbvkQDjjl1CMiIzN6bJhQn&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CfY-bW-sRjZbvkQDjjl1CMiIzN6bJhQn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Basically I just tried to initialize the TPU.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!pip install tensorflow-gpu
import tensorflow as tf
tf.__version__
# tpu_address = 'grpc://' + os.environ['COLAB_TPU_ADDR']

cluster_resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver()
tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(cluster_resolver)
tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(cluster_resolver)
tpu_strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy(cluster_resolver)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Full error message:

 Thanks for testing TF2.0 TPUs. This seems to be a known issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/huan/tensorflow-handbook-tpu/issues/1&gt;huan/tensorflow-handbook-tpu#1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which the colab kernel on tpu worker is out dated, Team is working on the fix. Thanks!

 Thank you. Is there any way to follow the progress on the matter or do you happen to know when the issue might be solved. Thanks!

		Uhh I don't it's fixed yet. Initializing works, but not fitting.
First off, you installed '1.15.0-rc3', not tensorflow 2.0.
Second, you need to fit under tpu_strategy.scope() to train it under the TPU
Do that, and you get an error.
Bottom line: TPU is not ready for Tensorflow 2.0 yet

		I am wondering if there's still issues with TPU support in tf 2.0. I have a model that runs just fine in GPU, but I am getting an
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    AttributeError: Tensor.name is meaningless when eager execution is enabled.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Error at self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_vars)).
