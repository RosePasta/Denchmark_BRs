	<summary>quantization with multiple gpu training</summary>
	<description>
when i try to quantization with multiple gpu training,   a error happened
KeyError: "The name 'tower_0/gradients/tower_0/MobileNet/conv_ds_13/pointwise_conv/BatchNorm/batchnorm_1/Rsqrt' refers to an Operation not in the graph."

   Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the exact command if possible to produce the output included in your test case. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new&gt;the Github new issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!
