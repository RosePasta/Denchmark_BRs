Describe the current behavior
Hi
I've trained a model to produce only one detection. I have converted it to tflite, I used this command to freeze the model: "export_tflite_ssd_graph.py --pipeline_config_path=/pipeline.config --trained_checkpoint_prefix=plate_detector/training/model.ckpt-33539 --output_directory=tflite --add_postprocessing_op=true --max_detections=1"
And I have changed NUM_DETECTIONS  to 1 in TFLiteObjectDetectionAPIModel,
but still getting this error:"Cannot copy between a TensorFlowLite tensor with shape [1, 10, 4] and a Java object with shape [1, 1, 4]".
Any help?
Describe the expected behavior
