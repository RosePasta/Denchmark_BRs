	<summary>Where is the nightly-android ?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The link &lt;denchmark-link:https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-android/&gt;https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-android/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (prebuilt android libraries) is broken but is still used in various files in documentation :

https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/android_build#android_inference_library
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/android/README.md

I use it for my app, but obviously I can't download the new versions.
Is there a new link from which we could retrieve built binaries for Android ?
Why has the nightly-android stopped running and will it restart eventually ?
Can someone fix the documentation files ?
Thanks.

		ci.tensorflow.org is deprecated.
We are working with tf mobile team to get the android builds back to healthy state and export the artifacts.

		you could use the aar package from here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://bintray.com/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/1.13.0-rc0&gt;https://bintray.com/google/tensorflow/tensorflow/1.13.0-rc0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
