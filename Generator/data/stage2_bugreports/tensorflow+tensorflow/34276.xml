	<summary>Tensorboard callback not writing the training metrics</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: pip
TensorFlow version: 2.0.0
Python version: 3.6.8
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.0.130
GPU model and memory: Quadro P5000 (16Gb)

Describe the current behavior
When I fit a model that takes time to infer (either with a big enough data size, or enough parameters), the TensorBoard calback doesn't log the training metrics (or just the first few epochs), or at least they don't appear on Tensorboard.
Although I first noticed the problem on GPU, it also appears on CPU.
Describe the expected behavior
I would like to have the training metrics logged as well.
Code to reproduce the issue
import os.path as op
import time

import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import TensorBoard
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

size = 512
im = Input((size, size, 1))
im_conv = Conv2D(512, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(im)
im_conv = Conv2D(1, 3, padding='same', activation='linear')(im_conv)
model = Model(im, im_conv)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam', metrics=['mae'])

data = np.random.rand(1, size, size, 1)

run_id = f'{int(time.time())}'
log_dir = op.join('logs', run_id)
tboard_cback = TensorBoard(
    log_dir=log_dir, 
    histogram_freq=0, 
    write_graph=False, 
    write_images=False, 
    profile_batch=2,
)

model.fit(
    x=data, 
    y=data, 
    validation_data=[data, data], 
    callbacks=[tboard_cback,], 
    epochs=100, 
    verbose=0,
);

I have posted an &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58823959/tensorboard-callback-not-writing-the-training-metrics&gt;SO question&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which didn't get too much traction, that's why I am asking here.
Here is what I observe on Tensorboard:

		Agree..., have the same issue here, tried your code and the tutorials same issue occurs.

		Thanks for the report.  The details look very similar to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/2084&gt;tensorflow/tensorboard#2084&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  Currently, there is a bug with TensorBoard's Keras callbacks that prevent training metrics from showing up/updating.
The current workaround for this, while we work on a solution, is to disable profiling entirely by adding profile_batch=0 to the callback options.

		Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?

		Please let us know if the workaround doesn't work!
Side note: I noticed in the screenshot that the Runs selector on the left is more narrow than the full sidebar.  This issue should be fixed in the most recent Tensorboard

		The workaround does work, I will follow &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/2084&gt;#2084&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to be aware of when the satisfying fix is be available. Thanks for this and the side note!
