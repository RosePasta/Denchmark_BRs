System information

I have written a custom callback for learning_rate_scheduler in keras
Code is running on Google Colaboratory:
TensorFlow version (use command below): tensorflow 2.2.0-rc3.
I need to be able to set and get my learning_rate and other params in my optimizer,

I need to be able to use the constructor of optimizer to set the parameters in it
Used the sample code in the keras documentation
"Issue Reproducing steps"

Run this code in Google colab
from keras import optimizers

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, kernel_initializer='uniform', input_shape=(10,)))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))
sgd = optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=sgd)
2. Throws Deserialization error
3. Attaching the screenshot of the erro
4.Please help with a resolution/workaround for this issue, as i am working on a critical course assignment which I need to submit soon .

		I have tried the above and have got no error. Please have a look at this &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/oke-aditya/b6f1cc3c292e1703b4e878f8748282d4/test.ipynb&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Maybe there is import issue or I have just changed the loss argument to "mse" (mean_squared_error).

i ran the code shared in nightly and there are no errors, please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/daa6959f58f5a3701e17c398077a56a8/38842-ipynbpip-install-tf_nightly.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

please confirm if the code provided is complete.

Thank you for the quick resolution.
It was an import error.
I am a novice programmer to Keras/Tensorflow . So I had to refer the Keras API documentation to code.
After referring the documentation for optimizers section as detailed above, there was
from keras import optimizers
and used the same import.
Could you please help to update documentation with the right import , so it could help other novice programmers not stuck with their development due to erroneous import .
Thank you for the resolution.

		Hi
This is the link &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/optimizers/&gt;https://keras.io/optimizers/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Refer the first section of code for optimizers.
Thanks once again.

		Tensorflow 2 uses Keras as high level API for model prototyping. Keras by itself is a different package.
Keras API has their own documentation which is correct for their package.
Tensorflow has its own documentation under tf.keras. Documentation issue of keras.io should be raised under Keras GitHub repository.
Please refer to tensorflow docs &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/overview&gt;docs link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 It would be easier to work with tensorflow. Mixing Keras docs with tensorflow while learning can lead confusion .
All the best. We all are new someday to Deep Learning. You will master it soon.
