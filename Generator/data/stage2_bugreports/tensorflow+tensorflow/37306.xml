Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 19.10
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below): pip install / tensorflow==2.0
Python version: - Bazel
version (if compiling from source): 3.7.5
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from
source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory: n/A

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
When force stopping a model on training, all the callbacks(on_epoch_end, on_train_end) are called. This does not happen with a keras model.
Describe the expected behavior
The other callbacks, namely on_epoch_end and on_train_end aren't supposed to be called.

Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full

,
I was able to reproduce the issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/ae4921f2d23cd2dfdf60524888168574/37306.ipynb&gt;TF2.1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, however the issue seems to be fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/da264a2d14b1b6242ee67f663e5059fe/37306-tf-nightly.ipynb&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. With TF-nightly, I see that the functions  and  are not being called.
Please find the attached gist. Thanks!
