	<summary>Making the URLs in the documentation clickable</summary>
	<description>
It would be nice if the URLs in the documentation were clickable.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/nn/conectionist_temporal_classification__ctc_&gt;Example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Can you share what the cause of this issue is?  I may throw up a quick PR if it's a relatively straightforward problem.

		The Markdown interpreter we are now using on tensorflow.org requires URLs to be enclosed in &lt;...&gt;.  I think we were hoping to come up with some logic that could identify URLs and rewrite them as part of our website publishing process -- see, e.g.,  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/docs/parser.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/docs/parser.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Is there anyone who is still working on this, or can we just do a quick fix?

		Any quick fix for these is welcome!
We're planning on some updates to the docs' markdown parser that will catch these, but that's farther out.
