	<summary>tf.placeholder API docs should mention possibility of None</summary>
	<description>
For tf.placeholder, it's possible to have None as one or more of the dimensions passed to the shape option. This is described in the MNIST tutorial, but is nowhere to be found in the API docs. The latter only mentions that the shape option itself may be None, but that is an entirely different thing.
