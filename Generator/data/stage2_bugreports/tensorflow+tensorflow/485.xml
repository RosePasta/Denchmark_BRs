	<summary>Backport for moved models.rnn.linear doesn't work</summary>
	<description>
In v0.6 linear got moved into ops.rnn_cell.linear, but backport here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/linear.py points to tf.nn.linear.
This break code with v0.5.

		Thanks, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ebrevdo&gt;@ebrevdo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can fix this.
Btw, that code was never part of the public API :(

		Well, since it wasn't part of the official API, this isn't really a bug. And I believe it still isn't documented, so it's still not "ready".  Closing for now!
