	<summary>Tensorboard file writer not working any more after nightly build tf-nightly 1.14.1.dev20190410</summary>
	<description>
I had to restart my script this morning and it automatically installs the latest nightly build of tensorflow (no other changes)
Unfortunately the file write doesn't produce any output anymore.
Yesterday with build 2.0.0-dev20190405 it worked just fine.
System information

Colab with tf-nightly 1.14.1.dev20190410 and w.o. HW acceleration
installed with !pip install tf-nightly-2.0-preview

Describe the current behavior
Tensorboard File Writer does not create any output files. The folder itself is still created.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(TENSORBOARD_LOG)               
with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('running_reward', running_reward,current_run)
    for w in self.model.trainable_variables:
        tf.summary.histogram(name=w.name, data=w, step=current_run)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Thanks for the report.  I'm not able to reproduce this with .
If you're still experiencing the issue, could you provide the contents of pip freeze in the environment where you are running the code?  I'm not totally clear from your description whether you installed tf-nightly, tf-nightly-2.0-preview, or both (and which versions).  If you're using the 2.0 preview, it's best to pip uninstall tf-nightly first, and also make sure you're using an up-to-date tensorboard nightly (via pip install -U tb-nightly).

		Sorry for the late answer. It seems fixed with the latest version (2.0.0-dev20190516)
