	<summary>Invalid argument error from tf.gather_nd after upgrade to r1.0</summary>
	<description>
I just upgraded to r1.0 and ran into an issue which I find hard to dissect further. The issue did not occur before when I was using version r0.12. The error message is the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Must have updates.shape = indices.shape[:IXDIM] + params_shape[IXDIM:], got updates.shape [1,4,1700], indices.shape [1,4,2], params_shape [1,73,1700]
	 [[Node: gradients/GatherNd_5_grad/ScatterNd = ScatterNd[T=DT_FLOAT, Tindices=DT_INT32, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"](GatherNd_5/indices/_77, gradients/AddN_9/_79, gradients/GatherNd_5_grad/Shape)]]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and the stack trace tells me it stems from the last of the following lines:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def positional(visible):
    """
    :param visible: a tensor of size (batch_size, input_dim, sequence_length) representing the sequence to be optimized
    """
    FEET = np.array([4, 5, 8, 9])
    feet_idx = np.array([range(i, i+3) for i in FEET*3])
    batch_size = visible.get_shape()[0].value
    dim = visible.get_shape()[1].value
    seq_length = visible.get_shape()[2].value
    idx_x, idx_y, idx_z = feet_idx[:, 0], feet_idx[:, 1], feet_idx[:, 2]
    idx_x_t = [[[j, i] for i in idx_x] for j in range(batch_size)]
    idx_y_t = [[[j, i] for i in idx_y] for j in range(batch_size)]
    v_feet_x = tf.gather_nd(visible, idx_x_t)
    v_feet_y = tf.gather_nd(visible, idx_y_t) #  stack trace points here
    ...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This function is called to calculate a cost function which is used during an optimization procedure. See below for a minimum working example.  The error, as far as I can tell from the stack trace, does not happen when the graph is built, but when the computation is executed, which is why I'm not sure how I can further narrow down the problem.

		I just tried your minimal test case in 0.12, and I got an error as well. Are you sure things were working in 0.12. Thanks!

 Thanks for your feedback. I tested it again in 0.12, too and also got an error, but this error is due to a bug in the minimum working example :) I'll edit this in just second. I then ran the fixed version on both 1.0 and 0.12, on 1.0 it does not pass, while on 0.12 it passes.
EDIT: minimum working example is now fixed (was an issue with indexing)

 The error message in your original post comes from a ScatterNd op which is the gradient code for the gather_nd op in your example.
The shape validation code for scatter_nd was changed recently.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ebrevdo&gt;@ebrevdo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - could you take a look at this please?

		<comment id='4' author='kaufManu' date='2017-03-16T09:28:14Z'>
		Is there any update on this? Just encountered it as well. Feels indeed that the shape validation part of scatter_nd is buggy.
It checks for updates.shape = indices.shape[:IXDIM] + params_shape[IXDIM:] but as far as I understand something like updates.shape = indices.shape[:-1] + params_shape[indices.shape[-1]:] is what is expected.
EDIT: by the way this test &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/63a21e054007d86269ed1ad0145ebce04ee57a81/tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/scatter_nd_ops_test.py#L480&gt;scatter_nd_ops_test.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fails for me when I reproduce it :
with tf.Session():
    indices = tf.zeros([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.int32)
    values = tf.zeros([1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    shape = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    tf.scatter_nd(indices, values, shape).eval()
EDIT2: apaprently was corrected &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3b7b39ac5dd2dceebe4b80b5e0b12316720a924b&gt;here already&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		See if the bug has been fixed in the nightlies / on master.  We worked on
this code after TF 1.0 was released.

Shouldn't the automatically gradient scatter_nd code have the correct shape if the forward mode gather_nd is correct? I have code that works fine in forward mode but produces this error when I try to run training. I just built the master branch on my machine (commit c44601f), but it doesn't make any difference.

I just went back and checked again and saw that my install of the master branch didn't take because the version # hasn't changed. I forced the install and indeed this fixes the problem for me, so this should be in 1.0.2, whenever that comes out.

		Same problem here on r1.0 with different shapes, for example tf.gather_nd(params, indces) works for:

params.shape = [24, 1296, 1]
indices.shape = [24, 20, 2]

whears does not for:

params.shape = [24, 1296, 21]
indices.shape = [24, 20, 2]

Getting same incorrect message.

		FWIW the shape of my tensors for output = tf.gather_nd(params, indices) are:
params.shape == (16,8,8,8)
indices.shape == (x,16,2)
output.shape == (x,16,8,8)
