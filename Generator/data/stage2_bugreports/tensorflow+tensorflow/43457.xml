System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.3.0
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: N/A (run with x86_64 CPU)


A model is trained for a multiclass classification task. Labels are a class vector. Method &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#evaluate&gt;evaluate&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 called on the trained model outputs an accuracy of 0.9579. After saving the model and loading the saved model, calling method  on the loaded model outputs an accuracy of 0.0997.
Describe the expected behavior
I would have expected the same accuracy output (0.9579) on the loaded model.
