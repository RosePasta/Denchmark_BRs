System information

Have I written custom code
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,Linux Ubuntu 18.04):
TensorFlow installed from binary
TensorFlow version 2.0:
Keras Version: tested with 2.3.1 and 2.3.0
Python version: - 3.6.5
CUDA/cuDNN version: - GPU model and memory:

Describe the current behavior
I have a feed-forward NN and I saved it as .h5 and I can make predictions, but when I set an endpoint using Flask and guinicorn and then I call my model for predictions I get the following message:
AttributeError: 'gevent._local.local' object has no attribute 'value'
Describe the expected behavior
the expected behavior would be that when I made a request
curl -X POST ....
it returned the predictions for my request
