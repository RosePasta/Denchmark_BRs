	<summary>GPU devices not detected in tf-nightly in latest releases (Google Colaboratory)</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I installed tf-nightly in a Google Colaboratory notebook and noticed that the model training time is significantly longer than when I was training it at the beginning of August. Then I ran
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print(tf.test.gpu_device_name())
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and no GPU devices were detected, even though the accelerator was set to 'GPU'.
But after uninstalling the latest release and installing tf-nightly-2.4.0-dev20200815 the GPU was successfully detected.
Trying out different releases, seems like it doesn't work as of 2.4.0-dev20200819 release.

		I confirm this. The c++ wrapper return only the CPU device:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tensorflow.python import pywrap_tfe
print(pywrap_tfe.TF_ListPhysicalDevices())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 this could create some false negative to your first stage triagers when the protocol require them to test on Colab gists with nightly about reproducibility. This is limited to GPU only ticket that require GPU runtimes.
E.g. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/42885&gt;#42885&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		P.s. I can also confirm that it starts with:
pip install tf-nightly==2.4.0.dev20200819

		Was able to reproduce the issue with latest TF-nightly i.e. v2.4.0-dev20200904, please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/25b8598fea215239f22d406a387c1735/42957.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I agree this is an issue with colab. Is this happening in the local with GPU? Thanks!

		2.4.0-dev20200819 is the first release with CUDA 11, so it is very likely that that's the root issue.  Colab needs to be adjusted to use CUDA 11 instead of CUDA 10.1.

 As mentioned by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sanjoy&gt;@sanjoy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this is related to colab. Can you please open an issue in colab repository &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!
