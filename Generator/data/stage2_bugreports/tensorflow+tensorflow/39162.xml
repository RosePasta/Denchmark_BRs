	<summary>Support for TensorList crossing the XLA/TF boundary is not implemented</summary>
	<description>
A colab notebook to reproduce the issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O-ht27_h4d6qf_65nmK52qLTrMyDLMVr&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O-ht27_h4d6qf_65nmK52qLTrMyDLMVr&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I am trying to implement a simple RNN compiled with XLA. The code works without XLA, but when I try to compile one tf function with XLA and I get a strange error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;UnimplementedError:  Support for TensorList crossing the XLA/TF boundary is not implemented
	 [[node dummy_name/StatefulPartitionedCall (defined at &lt;ipython-input-12-b36d3a96b1c7&gt;:30) ]] [Op:__inference_simple_train_5054]

Errors may have originated from an input operation.
Input Source operations connected to node dummy_name/StatefulPartitionedCall:
 data (defined at &lt;ipython-input-15-3f954a2dcc35&gt;:38)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am not sure what goes wrong when experimental_compile is added and if thats an expected behavior?

I ran your code on tensorflow 2.1 and do not face any issues, please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/196583ede82231e3e735f608b6bd154b/2.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
However, i am able to replicate the issue on nightly,please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/Saduf2019/46d5e3cf5a8c3fed81a49eb7878a6d2d/untitled163.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Thanks!

As you have not specified the tf version, we ran the code on 2.1 and nightly. please verify the gist and as the code works fine in 2.1, can we consider this as resolved.

		It fails for me when I run it with tf-nightly. I guess it could indicate a regression from 2.1 -&gt; 2.2?

Sure we will do so, will working on 2.1 help you for now, meanwhile we will look into nightly issue.

 This is expected behavior, this feature is not implemented.
We do plan on doing this, but it is non-trivial.
TensorArray is supported in XLA, but not in crossing the TF/XLA boundary. The problem is that taking a derivative from outside exposes the TensorArray to the boundary, and the conversion is not implemented.
The workaround is to make the outer function compile (your ), and potentially remove the inner compiled function (might be not necessary, but to avoid stumbling into your other issue in github.com/&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39060&gt;/issues/39060&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
