	<summary>Udacity readme docker command should not remove container</summary>
	<description>
The Udacity readme at
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/README.md&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/README.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

suggests starting Docker like this:
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --rm b.gcr.io/tensorflow-udacity/assignments:0.5.0
The --rm causes the container to get removed once you end the session, which deletes all your progress so far in the class. It would be better to not suggest --rm so that the docker container can then be resumed at a later time.

		Fair enough. I'll take a PR if you'd like.
