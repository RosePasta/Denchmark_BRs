	<summary>tensorflow1.13 add an op which use mkldnn cannot build sucessfully</summary>
	<description>

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes, in tensorflow/core/user_ops addop
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): windows10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.13
Python version:3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):0.20.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:None
GPU model and memory:None
Exact command to reproduce:
I just add an matmul op which use a function in mkldnn,and I can build successfully with bazel build  -c opt --copt=-msse4.1 --copt=-msse4.2  tensorflow:libtensorflow.so
But, when I build the target with bazel build  -c opt --copt=-msse4.1 --copt=-msse4.2   //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package , I got an error
ERROR: D:/tf_install/tensorflow_addop/tensorflow/python/BUILD:4057:1: in cmd attribute of genrule rule //tensorflow/python:gen__pywrap_tensorflow_internal.pyd: variable '$&lt;' : more than one input file. Since this rule was created by the macro 'tf_py_wrap_cc', the error might have been caused by the macro implementation in D:/tf_install/tensorflow_addop/tensorflow/tensorflow.bzl:1704:15 ERROR: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package' failed; build aborted: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/python:gen__pywrap_tensorflow_internal.pyd' failed; build aborted

I just add some codes in tensorflow/python/user_ops/user_ops.py
@tf_export(v1=['user_ops.own_dnnl_mul']) def own_dnnl_mul(arg1, arg2): """Example of overriding the generated code for an Op.""" return _gen_user_ops.own_dnnl_mul(arg1, arg2)

		Thanks for your reply,
I just add some codes in "tensorflow/core/user_ops"
and changed the BUILD file in "tensorflow/core"
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cc_library(
    name = "user_ops_op_lib",
    srcs = glob(["user_ops/**/*.cc", "user_ops/**/*.h", "user_ops/**/*.hpp"]),
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    deps = [":framework", ":dnnl", "mkldnn", ":iomp5md"],
    copts = ["-fexceptions"],
    linkopts = ["-fopenmp"],
    alwayslink = 1,
    )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

With above changes, I can build libtensorflow.so successfully.
But I want to build a whl to do a test,
I changed the file in "tensorflow/python/user_ops/user_ops.py"
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;@tf_export(v1=['user_ops.fsmn_forward'])
def fsmn_forward(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6, arg7):
  """Example of overriding the generated code for an Op."""
  return _gen_user_ops.fsmn_forward(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6, arg7)

@tf_export(v1=['user_ops.own_dnnl_mul'])
def own_dnnl_mul(arg1, arg2):
  """Example of overriding the generated code for an Op."""
  return _gen_user_ops.own_dnnl_mul(arg1, arg2)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am confused that, the problem was  caused by mkldnn, because, when I add one op which is not dependences on mkl-dnn, I can build .so and .whl, when I add deps = [":framework", ":dnnl", "mkldnn", ":iomp5md"], I just can build .so but not .whl
the error is as floowings:
ERROR: D:/tf_install/tensorflow_addop/tensorflow/python/BUILD:4057:1: in cmd attribute of genrule rule //tensorflow/python:gen__pywrap_tensorflow_internal.pyd: variable '$&lt;' : more than one input file.

		Sorry,
I have solved this problem by the following way.
At the beginning,I add the cc_import library as followings:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  # mylib.lib is a import library for mylib.dll which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "mylib.lib",
  # mylib.dll will be available for runtime
  shared_library = "mylib.dll",
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I was always got the error metioned above.
However, I changed the  cc_import library to:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  # mylib.lib is an import library for mylib.dll which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "mylib.lib",
  # mylib.dll is provided by system environment, for example it can be found in PATH.
  # This indicates that Bazel is not responsible for making mylib.dll available.
  system_provided = 1,
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then, I could build the .whl successfully.
But I donnot know the difference between Linking a shared library with interface library (Windows) and  Linking a shared library with system_provided=True (Windows)
Best Regards
