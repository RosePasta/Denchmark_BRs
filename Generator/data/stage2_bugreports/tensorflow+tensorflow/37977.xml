	<summary>Micro -- Crash in ErrorReporter::Report</summary>
	<description>
System information
TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers
running greedy_memory_planner_test from master
building with a Clang based compiler where va_list has the type void*
Describe the current behavior
Test crashes on
TF_LITE_REPORT_ERROR(error_reporter, "%s", line);
Most likely because the string arg matches two prototypes in this configuration of Clang, and its picking the wrong one. Ultimately it tries do dereference the literal string leading to a crash.
Describe the expected behavior
No crash, print some ASCII art.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
If you have Docker up and running, then call this from the tensorflow folder:
rm -rf tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/downloads/*
make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile clean
docker run -it -v$(pwd):/home/builder:z --rm xcoreai/build-tools:latest make -f tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET="xcore" test_greedy_memory_planner_test
 Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/37976&gt;#37976&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Fixes the immediate issue in greedy_memory_planner by adding an explicit typecast:
