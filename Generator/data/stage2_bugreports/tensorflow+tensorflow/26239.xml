	<summary>Why is op:BatchMatMul listed in file(.pbtxt), when there is no call to such op?</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution: Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version: 1.12
Python version: 3.6

Describe the current behavior
There is no usage of op named BatchMatMul in my code. But the op is listed in the file(.pbtxt) which gives me other issues while converting the graph to tflite.
Describe the expected behavior
If there is no explicit usage of the particular op, it should not be listed in file(.pbtxt)
