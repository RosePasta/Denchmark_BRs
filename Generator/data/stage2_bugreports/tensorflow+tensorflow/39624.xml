	<summary>lecun_normal and he_normal crash when type casting: TypeError: he_normal() got an unexpected keyword argument 'dtype'</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): idk
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0
Python version: 3.6.10
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: none
GPU model and memory: none

Describe the expected behavior
Successful type casting in tf.data.Dataset.map() function
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
from tensorflow.keras import Model
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
from tensorflow.keras.initializers import glorot_normal, he_normal, lecun_normal

dataset, info = tfds.load('binary_alpha_digits', with_info=True, split='train')
data = dataset.map(lambda x: (tf.cast(x['image'], tf.float32), x['label'])).batch(8)


class Model(Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = Dense(16, kernel_initializer=he_normal)
        self.layer2 = Dense(units=info.features['label'].num_classes)

    def call(self, inputs, training=None, **kwargs):
        x = self.layer1(inputs)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        return x


model = Model()
_ = model(next(iter(data))[0])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

glorot_normal: works
he_normal: doesn't work
lecun_normal: doesn't work

,
I was able to reproduce the error with TF v2.1 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/ef75f5e07621f04c2702ef3f789e243c/39624-2-2.ipynb&gt;TF v2.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, I was able to run the code without any issues with the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/7c9fd985c3b0e15ee6b1e475b73a54e4/39624-tf-nightly.ipynb&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please find the attached gist. Thanks!

,
The issue you are facing seems to be fixed with the TF-nightly version. I did not face any errors while running the code with TF-nightly and have attached the link for Python notebook below
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/7c9fd985c3b0e15ee6b1e475b73a54e4/39624-tf-nightly.ipynb&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/7c9fd985c3b0e15ee6b1e475b73a54e4/39624-tf-nightly.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you please verify it on your end and let us know if it works. Thanks!
