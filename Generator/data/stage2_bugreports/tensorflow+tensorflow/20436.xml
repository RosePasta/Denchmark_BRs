	<summary>Memory leaking in tf.data.Dataset in eager mode</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.8.0
Python version:  3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 9.0
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce:

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

tf.data.Dataset doesn't seem to free its own memory usage even it is out of scope in eager execution mode.
The memory I'm mentioning is the main memory not GPU's memory.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following codes are run in Jupyterlab.
Block 1:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.enable_eager_execution()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Block 2:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def run():
    data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(np.zeros((60000, 32, 32, 3))) 
    data = data.shuffle(10000)
    data = data.batch(128)
    x = next(iter(data))

run()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I repeat Block 2 many times and the memory usage grows each time.
Note: gc.collect() doesn't have any effect.

		Probably the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/19499&gt;#19499&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Worth trying on a more recent version that includes that fix (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/70674b950ab48f913ed1c99e48c4162287595d46&gt;70674b9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
(Not going to have time to look into this before going on vacation; feel free to reassign)

		Closing for now. Feel free to re-open if it's still an issue when synced after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/70674b950ab48f913ed1c99e48c4162287595d46&gt;70674b9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(FWIW I tried in a nightly, and memory usage does fluctuate a bit which I assume is due to buffering, but it doesn't seem to grow over a few minutes)
