	<summary>The performance with profiler seems much slower than normal</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I found something uninterpretable when profiling with tensorflow profiler.
The time measured with profiler seems much slower than without it. 
        eg: I translate a sentence with the model Transformer, it takes 70ms normally, but it takes 220ms with profiler. code as follows:
         with tf.contrib.tfprof.ProfileContext('/home/work/tmp/profile') as pctx
    Does profiler take too much overhead? Which part costs so much time?? Does the overhead take place in every op or between ops??
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Most of the overhead of tfprof are between steps. It takes a long time to parse the data it collect. So the result is more accurate than it appear.

 Closing this out since I understand it to be resolved, but please let me know if I'm mistaken.
