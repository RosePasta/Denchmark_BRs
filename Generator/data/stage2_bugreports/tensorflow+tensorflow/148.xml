<bug id='148' author='SkidanovAlex' open_date='2015-11-11T18:33:57Z' closed_time='2015-11-24T19:27:20Z'>
	<summary>Wrong link in the "common problems" docs</summary>
	<description>
On the "Getting started page" in the following part:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Common Problems
GPU-related issues

If you encounter the following when trying to run a TensorFlow program:

ImportError: libcudart.so.7.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Make sure you followed the the GPU installation instructions.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The last word "instructions" leads to &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org/#install_cuda&gt;http://www.tensorflow.org/#install_cuda&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, however the main page it leads to does not have an anchor "install_cuda", so it just ends up leading to the top of main page.
Presumably, the correct link is &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup.md#install_cuda&gt;http://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup.md#install_cuda&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for the report -- our website generation is undergoing fixes / changes this week -- it is also quite behind our github documentation.  We'll close this bug once we've fixed these issues, thanks!
