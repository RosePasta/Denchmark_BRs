	<summary>AttributeError: 'Callback' object has no attribute 'validation_data'</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a link to the documentation entry, for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Currently, the page &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says , but if I attempt to access the attribute  inside the callback I get the error . You should change the documentation to remove the attribute , which apparently was removed.
See also this issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/27318&gt;#27318&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I would like to help with this issue. Is this just a case of having the documentation instead state that validation_data has been removed/ removing the line entirely?

 If the PR is supposed to solve the problem and integrate the solution into the next TF release, yes, you can close this issue, otherwise, you should leave it opened.

 This was resolved already by this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1286b957c21eea2e956a51fcd758653ed7e7cb36&gt;fix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I cannot see  attribute in the  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/Callback&gt;TF callback page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Can you please verify once and close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!
