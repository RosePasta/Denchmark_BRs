System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.14.0
Python version: Py36
Bazel version (if compiling from source): bazel release 0.26.1
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 7.3.0
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:

I tried to include the op in the code as follows
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    idtable_op_module = tf.load_op_library(
    resource_loader.get_path_to_datafile('libid_table_op.so'))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

only to get the traceback infomation:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "wide_deep.py", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
    import jarvis.tensorflow as jtf
  File "/opt/ml/job/python/jarvis/tensorflow/__init__.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    from jarvis.tensorflow.feature_transform import *
  File "/opt/ml/job/python/jarvis/tensorflow/feature_transform.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    from jarvis.tensorflow import id_column
  File "/opt/ml/job/python/jarvis/tensorflow/id_column.py", line 44, in &lt;module&gt;
    from jarvis.tensorflow.id_table_ops import IdHashTable
  File "/opt/ml/job/python/jarvis/tensorflow/id_table_ops.py", line 29, in &lt;module&gt;
    resource_loader.get_path_to_datafile('libid_table_op.so'))
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/framework/load_library.py", line 61, in load_op_library
    lib_handle = py_tf.TF_LoadLibrary(library_filename)
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: libtensorflow_framework.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The trackback shows that there's no libtensorflow_framework.so, I tried to find this file in tf 1.14.0 binary version(not compiled version) and only found site-packages/tensorflow_core/libtensorflow_framework.so.1, but still no libtensorflow_framework.so. So what's the correct way to include so file, is it a bug in tf 1.14?

		You can use  to compile the library correctly.
They changed the naming convention recently, see e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/27430&gt;#27430&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 do you mind providing more details on how to exactly use ?

 Does it mean that the tf version that compiles the  file and the tf version that loading the compiled  file should be the same?

I think the docs cover this pretty good in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/extend/op#compile_the_op_using_your_system_compiler_tensorflow_binary_installation&gt;guide to extend TF&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
tf.sysconfig.get_link_flags() provides the linker flags to pass to the compiler to compile the .so library.

		I had the same problem and ended up downgrading my tf to 1.1.0 and CUDA to 9.2 and it works now.

 Seems to be the case. After failing to compile kernels on 1.14 due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/30494&gt;#30494&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I managed to compile them for tf1.13.1 but not loading them on tf1.14. From suggestion in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/31335&gt;#31335&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of using same compilers for building TF and custom op, only option to build custom ops + use AMP (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/26342&gt;#26342&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) seems to be to get TF from source.

 Thanks a lot for advice, finally I also chose to downgrade to tf1.13.1 and it worked.

		As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Spotlight0xff&gt;@Spotlight0xff&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned,  should contains the correct name for libtensorflow_framework. And you should build the custom op library against the TF pip version you want to run with. Closing this issue now. Let us know if you have more questions.
