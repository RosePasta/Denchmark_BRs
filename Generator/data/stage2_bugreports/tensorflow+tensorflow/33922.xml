	<summary>tf.compat purpose may be misstated</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Docs say

Functions for Python 2 vs. 3 compatibility.

But on &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58631390/what-is-the-purpose-of-tf-compat&gt;StackOverflow they told me that&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The documentation for the module about Python should actually be changed. Originally, tf.compat only held functions for that purpose (and it was like that until 1.13, see all module documentation). However, it was later repurposed for TensorFlow version compatibility.

		Good catch, thanks.
Should probably also point to the migration guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
