	<summary>Build Android demo, ambiguous python reference</summary>
	<description>
Hi, while I was building the android demo with the command bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/examples/android:tensorflow_demo --verbose_failures,  it throw the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: /home/damian/ai/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/android/BUILD:63:1: Extracting Java resources from deploy jar for split Java resource apk failed: resource_extractor failed: error executing command 
  (cd /home/damian/.cache/bazel/_bazel_damian/80fc8f2224411108cd5fffb32690db73/execroot/tensorflow &amp;&amp; \

  File "/home/damian/.cache/bazel/_bazel_damian/80fc8f2224411108cd5fffb32690db73/execroot/tensorflow/bazel-out/host/bin/external/bazel_tools/tools/android/resource_extractor.runfiles/org_tensorflow/../bazel_tools/tools/android/resource_extractor.py", line 98
    print USAGE
              ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to print

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I debuged the error and the cause is in the file bazel-out/host/bin/external/bazel_tools/tools/android/resource_extractor around the line 35:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;PYTHON_BINARY = 'python'
if IsWindows() and not PYTHON_BINARY.endswith('.exe'):
  PYTHON_BINARY = PYTHON_BINARY + '.exe'

# Find a file in a given search path.
def SearchPath(name):
  search_path = os.getenv('PATH', os.defpath).split(os.pathsep)
  for directory in search_path:
    if directory == '': continue
    path = os.path.join(directory, name)
    if os.path.isfile(path) and os.access(path, os.X_OK):
      return path
  return None

def IsRunningFromZip():
  return False

# Find the real Python binary if it's not a normal absolute path
def FindPythonBinary():
  if PYTHON_BINARY.startswith('//'):
    # Case 1: Path is a label. Not supported yet.
    raise AssertionError(
      'Bazel does not support execution of Python interpreters via labels yet')
  elif PYTHON_BINARY.startswith('/'):
    # Case 2: Absolute path.
    return PYTHON_BINARY
  elif '/' in PYTHON_BINARY:
    # Case 3: Path is relative to current working directory.
    return os.path.join(os.getcwd(), PYTHON_BINARY)
  else:
    # Case 4: Path has to be looked up in the search path.
    return SearchPath(PYTHON_BINARY)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the script  need and assumes the default /usr/bin/python is linked to python 2.x wich in my case is not,
My current work around is a simple ln -sf /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python.
I would like to patch but I dont have idea where is the file bazel-out/host/bin/external/bazel_tools/tools/android/resource_extractor because is an autogen script, I tried look for it in the bazel repo but I can't find it

 The simplest fix would seem to be to install Python 2.X if possible.
Closing however as this doesn't appear to be an actual issue with TensorFlow. You would probably be better off making a Bazel GitHub issue or asking on StackOverflow.
