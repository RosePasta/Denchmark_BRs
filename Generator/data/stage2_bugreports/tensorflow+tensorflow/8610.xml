	<summary>Tensorboard Embedding Sprite Image Aspect Ratio</summary>
	<description>
I tried to use tensorboard embedding visualization with sprite images.
It works well except two things:

Even though I set the image width and height as:
embedding.sprite.single_image_dim.extend([my_width, my_height])
and the projector_config.pbtxt file has:
sprite {
image_path: "sprite.png"
single_image_dim: my_width
single_image_dim: my_height
}
Tensorboard resizes the images to be square, though it can get correct part from the sprite image, except that:
Every last image of each row is not correct. This happens when I have lots of images (like 200 images with size 70*100).

Seems like it only support square images?

		I can confirm that indeed Tensorboard resizes the images to be square.

		Thanks for reporting this! I've migrated it to our new repository at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/44&gt;tensorflow/tensorboard#44&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
