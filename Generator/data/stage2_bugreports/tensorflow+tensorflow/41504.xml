Describe the current behavior
When running tf.broadcast_to, the input shown in the error message for an invalid argument is different from the given input.  [110, 53, 104, 147, 157, 123, 5, 24, 188, 40, 5, 2] (given) vs [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] (error message).
Describe the expected behavior
Correct error message
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
tf.broadcast_to([x, [110, 53, 104, 147, 157, 123, 5, 24, 188, 40, 5, 2])
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
InvalidArgumentError: Shape [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] would have more than 2**63 - 1 elements [Op:BroadcastTo]

		So the error isn't that misleading, you're getting it because you're broadcasting it to too big a tensor.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InvalidArgumentError: Shape [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2] would have more than 2**63 - 1 elements [Op:BroadcastTo]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

appears when the number of elements has exceeded the given limit. You will have more than 2**63 - 1 elements when you broadcast it to the given shape [110, 53, 104, 147, 157, 123, 5, 24, 188, 40, 5, 2] or the upper limit of shapes [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].

		The issue is that the construction of error message in tensor_shape.cc does not copy all dims of shape, only the current dim of the shape (when error check happens). Created a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/41514&gt;#41514&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the fix.
