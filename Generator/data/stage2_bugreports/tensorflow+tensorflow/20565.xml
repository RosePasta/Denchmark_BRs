Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):

no

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):

"16.04.4 LTS (Xenial Xerus)

TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):

binary

TensorFlow version (use command below):

tensorflow-gpu binary
tf.VERSION = 1.9.0-rc2
tf.GIT_VERSION = v1.9.0-rc1-48-ge3f2b5903c
tf.COMPILER_VERSION = v1.9.0-rc1-48-ge3f2b5903c

Python version:

Python 2.7.12

Bazel version (if compiling from source):

N/A

GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):

N/A

CUDA/cuDNN version:

CUDA 8.0
cuDNN 6.0

GPU model and memory:

GeForce GTX 960M 4GB RAM
NVIDIA Driver Version: 384.130

Exact command to reproduce:

from __future__ import print_function

import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
        N = tf.constant(10, dtype=tf.int64)

        def cond(i, s):
            return tf.less(i, N)

        def body(i, s):
            n = (i+1)*2
            return i+1, n

        loop_vars = [tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int64)]*2
        loop = tf.while_loop(cond, body, loop_vars)

    init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

    graph.finalize()

config = tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)

with tf.Session(graph=graph, config=config) as S:
    S.run(init)

    print(S.run(loop))
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When the above script is run, it produces (0,0) instead of the expected (10,20).
If one changes the device to /cpu:0 the expected result is produced.
I've tested that the GPU works with the following code:
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device("/gpu:0"):
    A = tf.ones([100,100])
    B = A*2

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

with tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)) as S:
    S.run(init)

    result = S.run(B)
    print(result.shape, result)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

N/A

		This also seems to fail on CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.1

		Closing out this issue because it hasn't been updated in the last year.  Please reopen if this is still relevant.
