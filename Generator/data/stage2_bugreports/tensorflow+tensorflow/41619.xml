Describe the current behavior
Trying to load trained model in native source code but getting an error "Could not open '/deeplab/deeplabv3_257_mv_gpu.tflite'." I have built libtensorflowlite.so through bazel for arm64.
Code:-
Java_com_example_myapplication_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(JNIEnv *env, jobject thiz) {
string model_file = "/deeplab/deeplabv3_257_mv_gpu.tflite";
StderrReporter error_reporter;
unique_ptrtflite::FlatBufferModel model;
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = FlatBufferModel::BuildFromFile(model_file.c_str(),
                                       &amp;error_reporter);
ops::builtin::BuiltinOpResolver resolver;
std::unique_ptr&lt;tflite::Interpreter&gt; interpreter;
if(model){
    InterpreterBuilder(*model, resolver)(&amp;interpreter);
    interpreter-&gt;AllocateTensors();
}else{
    return env-&gt;NewStringUTF("Model is Null");
}
return env-&gt;NewStringUTF("Hi from JNI LIBS!");
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

}

Tried to keep model at different locations like inside cpp folder where source file is present or inside assets folder parallel to cpp folder but still same error is coming.
Also tried to put model in mobile sdcard  and passing that path but still no luck.
Describe the expected behavior
Model should load.
