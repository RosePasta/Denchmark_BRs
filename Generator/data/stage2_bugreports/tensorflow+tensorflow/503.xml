	<summary>Request to add API documentation for using tf.flags</summary>
	<description>
I saw some tensorflow project contains hyperparameter configuration like:
tf.flags.DEFINE_integer("embedding_dim", 128, "Dimensionality of character embedding (default: 128)")
I think it is better to add corresponding document for using this feature.

		Our policy so far has been only to document the features that we intend to support in TensorFlow long-term. Currently we use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gflags/python-gflags&gt;python-gflags&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as the implementation for , but this is subject to change in future. In the meantime, the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gflags/python-gflags/blob/master/gflags.py&gt;documentation for that library&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the best source of usage information.

		I'm not sure if TensorFlow will use python-gflags in long-term or not, it would be better to add the link to refer to python-glags's documentation. Anyway, it seems that project has little document, either :(
