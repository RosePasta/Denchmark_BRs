	<summary>Cannot save tensorflow_probability.distributions.PixelCNN with tf.train.Checkpoint</summary>

Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.1.0-rc2-17-ge5bf8de 2.1.0
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: GTX 1070

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
Trying to save a model which includes a tfd.PixelCNN gives the traceback:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Shouldn't have a problem saving a distribution using tf.train.Checkpoint.save
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

model = tfd.PixelCNN(
    image_shape=(28, 28, 1),
    conditional_shape=(28, 28, 1),
    num_resnet=1,
    num_hierarchies=2,
    num_filters=32,
    num_logistic_mix=4,
    dropout_p=.3,
)
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model)
checkpoint.save(file_prefix='fails_before_here')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Thanks for the update. I've relaxed the checking a bit anyway (not sure exactly what it was complaining about, but it should complain less overall now).
