	<summary>TF1 tf.image.resize_image does not work with unbatched variable size image anymore since 1.12</summary>
	<description>
(Sorry for not adhering to the template, I can point to the problematic commit)
I use tf.image.resize_images to resize variable sized images in an unbatched manner, like so:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tf.image.resize_images(
            tf.reshape(x, [-1, 100, 3]),
            size,
            method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR
        )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I.e. some images are 100x100, some 110x100 etc. Upon updating tensorflow I received the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
  File "data_preprocess_amass.py", line 32, in __init__
    method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR
  File "/mnt/HDD1/julian/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/image_ops_impl.py", line 1187, in resize_images
    skip_resize_if_same=True)
  File "/mnt/HDD1/julian/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/image_ops_impl.py", line 1053, in _resize_images_common
    new_height_const = size_const_as_shape.dims[0].value
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I investigated it and it seems that the commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f43d458a318d4d97298710654f1692f6e8364f82&gt;f43d458&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the culprit, introducing the following lines to image_ops_impl.py:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;new_height_const = size_const_as_shape.dims[0].value
new_width_const = size_const_as_shape.dims[1].value
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

blame: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blame/r1.15/tensorflow/python/ops/image_ops_impl.py#L1053&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blame/r1.15/tensorflow/python/ops/image_ops_impl.py#L1053&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It is included since 1.12.1. Downgrading to 1.11 solved it for me. Might be a very special use case on a already deprecated function but I thought its worth reporting.

Request you to share colab link or simple standalone code with supporting files to reproduce the issue in our environment.It helps us in localizing the issue faster. Thanks!

		So its basically just the code I already presented:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
size = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)

result = tf.image.resize_images(tf.reshape(x, [-1, 100, 3]), size)

session = tf.Session()
r = session.run(result, {
    x: np.random.normal(size=(100, 100, 3)),
    size: [20, 20]
})
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

works on pre 1.12 and fails afterwards with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "py.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR)

    name=None)

    new_height_const = size_const_as_shape.dims[0].value
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I have tried in colab and i am not seeing any issue with TF version &lt;= 1.12 and i could reproduce the issue with TF version &gt;1.12.Please,find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/ravikyram/f3b22183898179523f0837b637d5ce47/untitled864.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.Thanks!

		The issue was that the line with the error was not v1/v2 TensorShape backwards compatible. It should be fixed at head now. Iâ€™ve &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C9_VBU-dSXnkabBLSUZWveylVQTzcfZK?usp=sharing#scrollTo=8r0M6AQoqXPK&gt;verified&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it with tf-nightly version 2.3.0-dev20200515.
On older branches, we unfortunately need to wait until the next patch release to cherrypick it in (note: supported versions are 1.5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2). If you need to work with TF versions &gt;= 1.13 and &lt;= 2.2, one interim possibility would be to build tf from source with the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/UofT-EcoSystem/tensorflow/commit/24c75ce5016efb4ab107f27b96aac07549d8617b&gt;two liner fix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
