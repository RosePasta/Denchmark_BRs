Hi,
the commit
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b97727bc3c7a9216670f361b639a60ed516917e0#diff-fa5fb3b8d9f512ad269f7eb67903ec2b&gt;b97727b#diff-fa5fb3b8d9f512ad269f7eb67903ec2b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

breaks the R TensorFlow client which uses embedded Python from R (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rstudio/tfdatasets/issues/17&gt;rstudio/tfdatasets#17&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
Specifically, the line
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;frame = stack[-4 if outer else -3]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

triggers the error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords) : 
  IndexError: list index out of range

Detailed traceback: 
  File "/home/key/anaconda3/envs/tf-master-1215/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py", line 314, in new_func
    _call_location(), decorator_utils.get_qualified_name(func),
  File "/home/key/anaconda3/envs/tf-master-1215/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py", line 103, in _call_location
    frame = stack[-4 if outer else -3]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

on our side. For us, in one specific example, instead of a list with at least 4 items, stack contains a list of 2 tuples, each of which are of length 6.
Unfortunately, this will error and stop execution every time a new deprecation warning is issued.
Current workaround on our side is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow/pull/287&gt;rstudio/tensorflow#287&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, however this comes at the cost of totally disabling deprecation warnings.
Is there anything you could do to make this change compatible?
Thanks,
Sigrid

 could you look at this? I think it's simply a matter of adding bounds checking before accessing the higher levels of the stack.

		I've sent a fix to Martin to review, so hopefully it should be submitted soon.

		Great, thanks so much for reacting this fast! Is there any chance this could still make it into 1.13?

 would be the decider on that.

		Great, thanks a lot for the quick fix, I just tested with the nightly and it works!
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aselle&gt;@aselle&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it would be great if you could answer reg. 1.13, we do have a temporary workaround but in case that's not needed we'd remove it :-)
Thanks!
