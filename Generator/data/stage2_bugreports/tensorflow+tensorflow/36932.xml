	<summary>Issue while using "drop_remainder=True" on validation set with TPU</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
Tensorflow version: 2.1.0

About hardware and software system information I'm using Kaggle kernels so more information can be found here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-python&gt;https://github.com/Kaggle/docker-python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


I'm getting errors like the ones below, when I use the argument  on the  function, but this happens only with the validation set:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16668746/74946458-18a92100-53d8-11ea-85ad-d9a2aaa1d0bc.PNG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The issue was further discussed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/flower-classification-with-tpus/discussion/130717&gt;this thread on the Kaggle forum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
The model was supposed to train normally like when I don't use the drop_remainder=True argument.

Link for the Kaggle kernel: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kaggle.com/dimitreoliveira/flower-classification-with-tpus-eda-and-baseline&gt;https://www.kaggle.com/dimitreoliveira/flower-classification-with-tpus-eda-and-baseline&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other info / logs
Here is a quick summary of the experiments:

Version 32: I've not used drop_remainder=True on any set and got no error.
Version 33: I've used drop_remainder=True on train and validation sets and got error.
Version 34: I've used drop_remainder=True only on train and got no error.
Version 35: I've used drop_remainder=True only on validation and got error.

So it seems the errors are related to using drop_remainder=True on the validation set.

		Is this still an issue?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ymodak&gt;@ymodak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , this was mostly related to memory issues, so it is no longer an issue, I'm closing.
