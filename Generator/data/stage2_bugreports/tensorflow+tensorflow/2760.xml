	<summary>Provide variable scoping documentation</summary>
	<description>
This is to track a documentation request from an external user:
The section on variable scopes is pretty helpful and we have been using it to make more complicated nets more manageable. I think some information (could be informal, like a blog post) on best practices that perhaps Googlers are encouraged to follow in structuring their tensorflow code (e.g. for the purposes of speed, variable re-use, minimizing memory consumption, code reusability) would be of high interest to a lot of people. I get the feeling that most of that information might already be available but just that it is distributed across different parts of the documentation.

 Any updates here?

		This would be nice to have, but since we do have some documentation on variable scopes it's probably lower priority than some other gaps.

		Closing due to inactivity, not sure if it's obsolete. Feel free to re-open.
