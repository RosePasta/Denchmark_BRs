System information

example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device: NA
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): - TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0:  2. TF 2.0: 
Describe the current behavior
We have created a sample resume classification model and saved the model with morethan 95% accuracy on train and test data set.After we have loaded the model and trying to make the predictions by defining prediction_classes using tf.argmax and we have observed some ambuiguity in predictions(Not predicting the correct label)
Describe the expected behavior
The predictions should be accurate after loading the model
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.

Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

Yes the issue still persists. Predictions are accurate on train and validation data before saving the model.After saving the model we loaded the model and tested on new unseen data where predictions are going wrong. I tried with saving different file formats(.h5,.pb formats) but still problem exists, Can you please help us to fix this issue . Thanks!
