	<summary>ios documentation for tensorflow-experimental</summary>
	<description>
Could we have a proper documentation (either in the pod files with a custom header) or in the readme?
It would help greatly to have the list of available methods and what they do (unless method name is self-explanatory).
Having to dig into ~20 objective-c files to get a grasp of what is possible in swift is not equivalent to a proper documentation

		It goes beyond that.
After a close look i now see that your ios framework is in fact a c++ library just wrapped to be downloaded by cocoapods.
So it seems we have absolutly no way to use swift with tensorflow except if we wrappe everything ourselves

		Closing this as we'll be switching over to the TensorFlow Lite pod for iOS rather than investing in this original TensorFlow Mobile approach.
