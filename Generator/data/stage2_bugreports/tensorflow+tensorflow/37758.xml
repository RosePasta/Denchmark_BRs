	<summary>tf.io.gfile.glob missing some patterns. Using tf-nightly</summary>

,
Please have a look on issue from  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/issues/1670&gt;tensorflow/datasets#1670&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, tests are failing for and  datasets because in  function of both &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/image/plant_village.py#L142&gt;plant_village.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/image/the300w_lp.py#L116&gt;the300w_lp.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  does not correctly matches all examples patterns. However python &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html&gt;glob&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 solves issue see PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/pull/1684&gt;tensorflow/datasets#1684&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


tf.io.gfile.glob() must matches all patterns provided so that all required examples are generated.

Please have a look on this &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tfLOQubRWd6Dc9mPTtAwca-eAzctGLId&gt;colab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 notebook, it contains all tracebacks as well as problem with  and how python solves this issue.
As glob fix this issue but we have to use tf.io.gfile because we need to support GCS and other distributed files systems.

		Yes, TFDS tests have started failing for patterns like: tf.io.gfile.glob('/path/to/file/[!Code]*[!_Flip]/[!_]*.jpg') or tf.io.gfile.glob('/path/to/*.[jJ][pP][gG]').
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Eshan-Agarwal&gt;@Eshan-Agarwal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Could you provide a small self-contained code snippet to reproduce the issue ?
Something like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import glob
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.io.gfile.GFile('/tmp/file') as f:
  pass

print(list(tf.io.gfile('/tmp/some_pattern')))
print(list(glob.glob('/tmp/some_pattern')))   # Should show different result
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		+1 on providing simple patterns.
I can look into this in about a month or two, once modular filesystems (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/community/pull/101&gt;tensorflow/community#101&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) are implemented

 the difference between the colab and the example template suggested is that we need to have the exact same setup for the colab, whereas the suggested template creates the files (with zero bytes) so it can be easily converted into a test case that now fails and after fixing will succeed.
But it's ok, I'll take care of this issue.

 For the future, here is what a minimum reproductible example looks like:
import os
import glob
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf

# Write a dummy file
root_dir = '/tmp/dir_with_(brace)/'
tf.io.gfile.makedirs(root_dir)
with tf.io.gfile.GFile(os.path.join(root_dir, 'some_file.txt'), 'w') as f:
  f.write('')

# Search the file
glob_path = os.path.join(root_dir, "*")
print(list(glob.iglob(glob_path)))        # ['/tmp/dir_with_(brace)/some_file.txt']
print(list(tf.io.gfile.glob(glob_path)))  # []  &lt;&lt; Bug: File not found
This allow the team to easily understand what the issue is. They can just copy past the code and experiment with it. This save many hours, as all people working on the issue can get started immediately without having to go through the 10000+ lines of codes of TFDS.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mihaimaruseac&gt;@mihaimaruseac&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 The bug is that  fails when  are present in the path. This is a regression as it only appear in TF nightly. Not TF 2.1.
This make some TFDS tests fails as some datasets rely on this global pattern to generate the dataset.

  thanks for your quick responses, Actually I upload temp folder containing some example you can download folder from &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DyMHIXSUue10k1a9pDbwgHK0Lng9VxuM?usp=sharing&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but it is good to use code provided by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Conchylicultor&gt;@Conchylicultor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  without any external uploading.

, do you know if this will this be fixed before the 2.2 release ? Otherwise, it will break some of our TFDS users using those datasets.
Worse, as no error is raised with , it will silently generate bad datasets where some examples are missing.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gadagashwini&gt;@gadagashwini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'm not sure why you added the  label.  works fine, but  is broken.

		We haven't prioritized this for 2.2 release, unfortunately. Can you verify that installing 2.2.-rc1 breaks you? Let me know if that is the case and I'll see if we can prioritize it.

 thank you for confirming.

 I believe this should be prioritised. This not only impact TFDS but potentially every users using . As the issue is silent, users may not even notice there is a bug.
In our case we got lucky to have good unit-tests.
Note: The issue only happened externally. Internally, our tests works fine.

		Reopening to close once the fix lands on r2.2 branch (and then will be picked up by the next RC).
