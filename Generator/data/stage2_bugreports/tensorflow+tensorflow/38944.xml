	<summary>UnrecognizedFlagError when using tf.vectorized_map() with lbfgs_minimize()</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04.2
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone UnrecognizedFlagErrortf8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: -
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0   (v2.1.0-rc2-17-ge5bf8de)
Python version: 3.7.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source): -
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -
CUDA/cuDNN version: -
GPU model and memory: -

Describe the current behavior
when trying to access the tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize() - object parameters during a tf.vectorized_map() operation, it throws the error: UnrecognizedFlagError: Unknown command line flag 'f' as well as ERROR:tensorflow:Got error while pfor was converting op name: "loop_body/PartitionedCall"
Describe the expected behavior
you can simply extract the position of this object during the loop

the issue was originally created with following code on my laptop (with above mentioned versions) but can also be reproduced in this colab:

,
I was able to reproduce the error with &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/5007574fec22eea48ebad42bd700761f/38944-2-2.ipynb#scrollTo=wL6gGpxhkeA0&gt;TF v2.2.0-rc3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, the issue seems to be fixed with the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/b59a88f5e0254e2cf2099675385ccccc/38944-tf-nightly.ipynb&gt;TF-nightly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as I was able to run the code without any errors. Please find the attached gist. Thanks!

		great! I can confirm that the tf-nighly build in combination with tfp-nightly fixes this problem
thanks a lot. this can be closed.
