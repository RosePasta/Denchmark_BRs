	<summary>Newer TF post-install python test does not expose CUDA/cuDNN driver problems</summary>
	<description>
System information Windows 10

TensorFlow version: tf-nightly-gpu (Oct. 25. 2018)
Doc Link:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip

Describe the documentation issue
The suggested post-install test:
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)" 
passes even when there are unresolved GPU CUDA/cuDNN driver issues.
The test previously suggested exercises the CUDA/cuDNN GPU drivers and seems to be better one to suggest:
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; hello = tf.constant('Hello, TF'); sess = tf.Session(); print(sess.run(hello))" 
We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?

		Thanks, but I'd like to avoid the Session API.

 Will  highlight a bad GPU config?

		tfe.num_gpus() won't but enable_eager_execution followed by a matmul (of floats) will.
