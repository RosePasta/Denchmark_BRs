	<summary>There is a learning_rate parameter in the Adadelta implementation although there isn't such one in the original paper</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I see in the documentation that  has a  parameter, but in the original paper that parameter was eliminated from the update rule &lt;denchmark-link:http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5701v1.pdf&gt;see equation 14 in the paper&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (or step 5 in the pseudo code of the algorithm).
Is that a bug in the implementation?
If you deliberately add a learning_rate parameter, I think that the API documentation should state explicitly that this is NOT the exact implementation of the algorithm as in the paper.

		To me it looks like with lr==1 you get exactly the paper. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eranamar&gt;@eranamar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, could you submit a pull request to that effect, please?
