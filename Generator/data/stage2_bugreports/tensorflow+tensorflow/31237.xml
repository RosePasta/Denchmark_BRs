&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The current documentation reads:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  Call arguments:
    inputs: A 3D tensor.
    mask: Binary tensor of shape `(samples, timesteps)` indicating whether
      a given timestep should be masked.
    training: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
      training mode or in inference mode. This argument is passed to the cell
      when calling it. This is only relevant if `dropout` or
      `recurrent_dropout` is used.
    initial_state: List of initial state tensors to be passed to the first
      call of the cell.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It would be worth mentioning that

mask, training, and initial_state are optional
if initial_state is not provided, default zeros are imputed (by calling cell.get_initial_state() or cell.zero_state()), see tensorflow_core/python/ops/rnn.py lines 677 or 1382.

Due to iheritance of RNN layers (incl. mixins) and missing documentation at some places (haven't found any comments on get_initial_state), it's quite hard to figure it out.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Submit a pull request?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'd like to keep it to someone who really knows the Keras internals; to me it's still a bit cryptic (i.e., where exactly get_initial_state_fn comes from, etc.)
