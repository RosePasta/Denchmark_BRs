I could restore checkpoints.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os
import tensorflow as tf

graph_path = os.path.join('plant_disease_classification/ckpts/', 'plants-disease-model.meta')
checkpoint_path = os.path.join('plant_disease_classification/ckpts/', 'plants-disease-model')

session = tf.compat.v1.Session()
saver = tf.compat.v1.train.import_meta_graph(graph_path)
# get error on line below
saver.restore(session, checkpoint_path)
# and try this as well same depracation error
saver.restore(session, tf.train.latest_checkpoint('plant_disease_classification/ckpts/'))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Just to verify whether you are able to restore previously saved checkpoint variables .Deprecation warning gives information about the function which will not be available in future version and it makes the user aware of this information.

		That's not an error, it's just a warning. It won't stop program execution.
