	<summary>tf r1.0 strided_slice documentation</summary>
	<description>
In the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/strided_slice&gt;docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the following sentences seem incomplete/incoherent:


If the ith bit of ellipsis_mask [is-set-to-something], as many unspecified dimensions as needed will be inserted between other dimensions. Only one non-zero bit is allowed in ellipsis_mask.


If the ith bit of new_axis_mask is one, then a? begin, end, and stride are ignored and a new length 1 dimension is added at this point in the output tensor

		I did, and it's already been &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/7831&gt;merged&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

So I guess this can be closed
