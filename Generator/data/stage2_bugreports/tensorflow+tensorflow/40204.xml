Please make sure that this is a bug. As per our
GitHub Policy,
we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and
build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: No
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.2.0-rc4-8-g2b96f3662b 2.2.0
Python version: 3.6.9
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
When passing 0 in argument dims in tf.unravel_index function, a floating point exception occurs because of divide by zero in  mod_op function at tensorflow/core/kernels/unravel_index_op.cc:29.
Describe the expected behavior
No crash in the c++ level. I would expect an exception in python saying that dims argument should not be 0.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate
the problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; tf.unravel_index(indices=[2, 5, 7], dims=[3, 0])"
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full
traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
