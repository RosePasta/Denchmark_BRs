Describe the current behavior
deeplab doesn't segment on ios
Describe the expected behavior
deeplab segmentation on ios application
Code to reproduce the issue
tflite_convert ----output_format=TFLITE --inference_type=FLOAT --inference_input_type=FLOAT --input_arrays=sub_2 --input_shapes=1,224,224,3 --output_arrays=ResizeBilinear_2 --output_file=/Users/Karizma/Downloads/deeplabv3_mnv2_pascal_trainvall/frozen-224.tflite --graph_def=/Users/Karizma/Downloads/deeplabv3_mnv2_pascal_trainvall/frozen-224.pb --mean_values=128 --std_dev_values=127 --allow_custom_ops --post_training_quantize
Other info / logs
Hi, I have trained deep lab on my custom dataset(200*150) with 224 as crop size and during the test, it detects for crop with crop size 224 .
now what I need is to integrate my model on ios application, i was able to successfully convert the model to tflite .but i does not detecte anything i don't get it whats the problem
because when i tried to convert a deeplab pretrained mobilenet mode llink it works for me on mobile and for my model no ,however i have tested my model (.pb model)with python code and it detects
this is my model architecture i hope it will be helpful to indrestoud what's going on

		We've recently added an Image Segmentation example app for iOS, using DeepLabV3 model.

Could you try running it?
