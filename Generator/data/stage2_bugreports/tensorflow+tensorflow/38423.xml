	<summary>Error when loading h5 model inside strategy scope</summary>
	<description>

GitHub Policy,

build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:bug_template
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock
example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g.,
Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if
the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or
binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.1.0
Python version: Python 3.7.5
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: CUDA 10.1.243, CuDNN 7.6.4
GPU model and memory: error with CPU and GPU

Describe the current behavior
Cannot load a model from a h5 file inside a strategy context (either CPU, GPU or mirrored) whereas load_model works without strategy context.
Inside a strategy context, it gives error :

c:\program files\python37\lib\site-packages\tensorflow_core\python\keras\optimizer_v2\optimizer_v2.py in apply_gradients(self, grads_and_vars, name)
439         return control_flow_ops.no_op()
440       apply_state = self._prepare(var_list)
--&gt; 441       return distribute_ctx.get_replica_context().merge_call(
442           functools.partial(self._distributed_apply, apply_state=apply_state),
443           args=(grads_and_vars,),
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'merge_call'

This issue is linked to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32359&gt;#32359&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
load_model call should work in both cases : with or without the use of a strategy context.

The zip archive containing the h5 file of the model is attached :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/files/4460828/dummy_model.zip&gt;dummy_model.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here is the code to reproduce the issue :
import tensorflow as tf

model_path = "dummy_model.h5"

##### WORKING CASE #####
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)
model.summary()
########################

##### NON WORKING CASE #####
strategy_context = tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy(device="/cpu:0")  # not working also with "/gpu:0" and MirroredStrategy
with strategy_context.scope():
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)
    model.summary()
############################

 I agree with you that it is not working with . However, when I tried with recent , it is working as expected. &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/b93d61013733e421467e1180e3576f82/loading_model_in_scope.ipynb&gt;Here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is a gist for your reference. Based on the gist, I guess this was resolved in recent . If you like stable version, In the near future there will be stable  release.
Please verify once and close the issue if this was resolved for you. Thanks!

 Thanks for your reply. However the model you tried in your gist is not the same as in my issue. Can you try with the same h5 file I provided ?

 is the gist with your model. Thanks!

 ok thanks, then I will wait for the TF2.2 stable version and in the meantime I won't use any context with the 2.1.
Since it works with the latest nightly, I close this issue.
