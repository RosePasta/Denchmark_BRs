	<summary>Document the broadcasting behavior for `tf.mul` etc.</summary>
	<description>
The fact that many of the elementwise operators in TensorFlow support numpy-style broadcasting is not well documented or discoverable. (e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34220374/apply-1-channel-mask-to-3-channel-tensor-in-tensorflow/34220963&gt;This SO question.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) We should improve the documentation on this.

		Not urgently, so perhaps "contributions welcome" is more appropriate.

		If anyone takes this on, it should go in the doc string at the top of math_ops.py.

 Should this be a generic comment saying that TF uses numpy-style broadcasting? Or should it be specific to the operations that are affected by it (alternatively just mention the operations)?

		TF doesn't use numpy style broadcasting for all ops, just for elementwise operations (specifically binary elementwise operations).  Referring to elementwise ops is sufficient; there's no need to list them all.

 Should this issue be closed? Or are there other changes that need to be made?

		We could have documentation on every elementwise op that supports broadcasting (numpy does mention broadcasting somewhere in the notes of every op.

 Putting it in every op seems unpleasant to maintain.

		Final thoughts on this? I agree with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vrv&gt;@vrv&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I think we should have one sentence for each op that supports broadcasting.

		I'll reverse my previous position: putting a sentence in every op, ideally with a link to a more detailed discussion of broadcasting, would be great.

 would you update the doc based on the comments in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/3534&gt;#3534&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

 Friendly ping, can you update this issue once it's fixed?

		<comment id='13' author='mrry' date='2016-08-15T23:41:23Z'>
		I believe this has been "fixed" with a commit that added this to all of the element wise ops in their cc files.
