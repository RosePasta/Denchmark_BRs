	<summary>Warnings raised for deprecated collections.abc usage.</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): b'v1.13.0-rc1-0-g63c13ff' 1.13.0-rc1
Python version: 3.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory: irrelevant

Describe the current behavior
TensorFlows raises warnings like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;jumping/simulation/test/test_simulation.py::test_gpu_inference[Device.tensorflow]
  /home/neil/.pyenv/versions/3.7.0/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/nest.py:823: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working
    _pywrap_tensorflow.RegisterType("Mapping", _collections.Mapping)

jumping/simulation/test/test_simulation.py::test_gpu_inference[Device.tensorflow]
  /home/neil/.pyenv/versions/3.7.0/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/util/nest.py:824: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working
    _pywrap_tensorflow.RegisterType("Sequence", _collections.Sequence)

jumping/simulation/test/test_simulation.py::test_gpu_inference[Device.tensorflow]
  /home/neil/.pyenv/versions/3.7.0/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/checkpointable/util.py:448: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
These warnings should not be raised.
Code to reproduce the issue
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import warnings
warnings.simplefilter("error")
import tensorflow
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
I can do this if the patch will be accepted.

 Could you try the solution provided &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35911252/disable-tensorflow-debugging-information&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to disable warnings, errors etc. If that was not solving, please provide a code to reproduce the issue. Thanks!

 The tensorflow log level is not related to the warnings I'm talking about, which are raised by Python.  The problem is that tensorflow needs to fix its imports.
Right now, these are just warnings, but Python 3.8 will be released in October. If we want tensorflow to keep working, we will need to fix this anyway.

		For 1.13, the branch is closed unless we have security issues. But I am happy to accept this patch for master.
