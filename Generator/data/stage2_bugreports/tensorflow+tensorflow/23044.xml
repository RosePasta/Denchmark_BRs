	<summary>Failed to allocate tensors.</summary>
	<description>

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): CentOS 7
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: iPhone 6s
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source
TensorFlow version (use command below): master
Python version: 2.7
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.15.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): None
CUDA/cuDNN version: 7.0
GPU model and memory: None
Exact command to reproduce: None

I get this error - "tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels/conv.cc:201 filter-&gt;type != data_type (3 != 1)
Node 1 failed to prepare."
in this part of code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    if (interpreter-&gt;AllocateTensors() != kTfLiteOk) {
        NSLog(@"Failed to allocate tensors.");
        exit(-1);
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For float model everything work correctly, but for quant I get this issue.
How could I Fix it?

@GlebGer : Can you attach the model and the conversion command.
Thanks for your answer!

 : I was able to run model without problems, can you also paste the code before allocating tensors. Also trying running on latest TFLite if possible.
Also perhaps related &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22995&gt;#22995&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks a lot for your help!
Did you run it in "camera" example? Did you run it on iOS?
Can you please share me your code?

 Is it still happening, can you checkout latest (or new release branch) and retry. Since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22995&gt;#22995&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 had a fix submitted.
Thanks
