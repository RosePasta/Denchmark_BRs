	<summary>tf.Tensor documentation in TF2</summary>
	<description>
System information

TensorFlow version: 2.0 alpha
Doc Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor

Describe the documentation issue
The documentation of tf.Tensor in the 2.0 section is still about the tf.Tensor as a symbolic tensor that contains the result of a  tf.Operation and it states that the only way to get its value is to use a tf.Session to run the node.
This is no more the truth in tf2:

tf.Session is no more available
tf.Tensor holds the value of the computation and we can extract it using .numpy().

We welcome contributions by users. Will you be able to update submit a PR (use the doc style guide) to fix the doc Issue?
Yes, I can submit a PR if needed - in the PR I can remove any reference to tf.Session and replace the introduction, explaining what is a tf.Tensor in Tensorflow 2.0.

		I just want to confirm that whether  we have to remove tf.session() from class Tensor description or from complete ops.py wherever it is ,eigther in description or in function.
