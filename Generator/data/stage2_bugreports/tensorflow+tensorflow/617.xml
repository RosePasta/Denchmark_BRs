	<summary>Docs for tf.device should point to tf.Graph.device</summary>
	<description>
Currently the docs for tf.device located here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/framework.html#device&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/framework.html#device&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

point to tf.Graph.name_scope() for more details, when it would be a lot more helpful if they pointed instead to tf.Graph.device(), i.e. here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/framework.html#Graph.device&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/framework.html#Graph.device&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This would be more consistent with the rest of the docs as well.
