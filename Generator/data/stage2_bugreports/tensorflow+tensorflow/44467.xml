	<summary>h5py==3.0.0 causes issues with keras model loads in tensorflow 2.1.0</summary>
	<description>
h5py released version 3.0.0 today and it causes this code to fail:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/hdf5_format.py#L182&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/hdf5_format.py#L182&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

with error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/databricks/python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/saving/save.py", line 146, in load_model
return hdf5_format.load_model_from_hdf5(filepath, custom_objects, compile)
File "/databricks/python/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/keras/saving/hdf5_format.py", line 166, in load_model_from_hdf5
model_config = json.loads(model_config.decode('utf-8'))
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It looks like in version 2.1.0 the h5py version is not pinned (it is pinned in master), which is causing the issue.

		I think it will be hard to expect a backport on 2.1.0.

		the new h5py version just came out today: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/h5py/#history&gt;https://pypi.org/project/h5py/#history&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Pinning it to a version &lt;3.0.0 (or at least throwing a warning) is a very lightweight change with no risk.

Yes but as you know generally we had very few patch releases (e.g. 2.1.x) so It Is quite hard to have wheels with these fixes on old versions.

 I'm not going to add any more messages after this, but I think you can see based on these other issues the Keras API is essentially broken because h5py new release. I'm not sure why the version was not pinned as it is in master, but I strongly advise that you pin to h5py==2.10.0 this for all TF &gt;= 2.1.

 there are many Dockerfile and other file not constrained.

		FWIW, I got a similar error message with h5py 3.0, and removing .decode('utf-8') from tensorflow/python/keras/saving/hdf5_format.py allows me to load Keras models as before.

		We cannot pin the versions without doing a patch release. We only do patch releases for security issues.
This issue has a quick workaround: pip install tensorflow h5py&lt;3.0.0.
We are in the process of releasing TF 2.4 which should not be affected by this issue.

		Thought it might be pertinent to link to the h5py repo:
This has been labeled as a bug in their 3.0.0 release (rather than a backwards incompatibility),
and is slated to be fixed in an upcoming release: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/h5py/h5py/issues/1732&gt;h5py/h5py#1732&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

edit:
Actually, there might be two separate but related issues here. The bug in the h5py thread occurs during the model-save codepath, but the bug in this TensorFlow thread is in the model-load codepath, which if I had to wildly guess might require a typecheck/cast on TensorFlow's side

That seems the case. I tried h5py 3.1.0, and the error AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode' still happens.

		Downgrading to h5py worked some time ago. Now old h5py does not work and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/40991&gt;#40991&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Has this been fixed yet for TF 2.3.1?

Downgrading TF to 2.3.0 works for me.

		Just try
pip install h5py==2.10.0
It completely worked in my case.
Hope it will work for you.

 You said that master (I assume 2.4.0) is compatible with h5py 3.1, but I still have this issue...

Not in time for 2.4.0 so master from source of nightly TF wheels
