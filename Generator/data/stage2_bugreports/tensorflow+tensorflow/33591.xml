@Samsomyajit I think I found the package!
https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-nightly/github/tensorflow/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/arduino_x86_64/prj/person_detection/tensorflow_lite.zip
It's named tensorflow_lite.zip instead of person_detection.zip
We were able to flash the example correctly after renaming the zip to person_detection.zip, renaming the library name as it appears in Arduino/libraries/ to person_detection, as well as changing the name in the  library.properties file in the zip to name=TensorFlowLite:person_detection

In reference to the above reply from  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/smellslikeml&gt;@smellslikeml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the package was named tensorflow_lite.zip instead of person_detection.zip , that was the reason it was not openning but with the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/33579&gt;#33579&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I have updated the link... so the problem no longer exist
