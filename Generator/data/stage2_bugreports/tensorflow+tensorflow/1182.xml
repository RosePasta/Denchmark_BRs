	<summary>Small bug in TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning tutorial [FIXED, pending website pushes]</summary>
	<description>
There is a small bug in the code on the site: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.7/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10], name='bias'))
should be:
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]), name='bias')
The consequence is that when you view the graph, the 'bias' variable has no useful label and is simply Variable.

		This was fixed earlier today in: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5df9ff89a58a17e6efca7f186b57f22430130768&gt;5df9ff8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We'll probably amend our docs to fix this eventually.  Going to leave this open until then.

		Are the docs fixed? I can take this one to begin with.

		This is fixed for docs versions later than 0.7. Do we have a policy on backporting documentation fixes to older versions?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martinwicke&gt;@martinwicke&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 want to chime in?

		FWIW I would be fine just closing this because I don't think many people will find the 0.7 docs.

 (or anyone else), if you are motivated enough to send a fixing PR against 0.7 we'll happily accept it. But I will close this issue, it's not enough of a problem since it's fixed in 0.8 and master.
