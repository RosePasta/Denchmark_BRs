 do you have an example of what you are trying to convert?
it looks like you have a code, that has one line that is an extra indentation - whitespace

 It looks like you have less indentation. Would you mind to copy here lines ?

		Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the code snippet to reproduce the issue. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in the Github new issue template.
We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ravikyram&gt;@ravikyram&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I'm trying to upgrade my code to TF2.0.First I install TF2.0alpha0-gpu  on google colab (python 3.6)then I typed the command  !tf_upgrade_v2 --infile train.py --outfile train_upgraded.py  to generate the upgraded version.
The link of the code:&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2/blob/master/scannet/train.py&gt;https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2/blob/master/scannet/train.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Please double check indentation, used in code. Seems like authors combine tabs with whitespaces, that causing the issue.

 what do you think?
