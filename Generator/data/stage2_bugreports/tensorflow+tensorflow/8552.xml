I confirm that more than one demos will encounter this issue if using distributed training under tensorflow 1.0.1 image.
Hope some improvements for distributed training to demo how to use distributed training.
Thanks.

 might fix this issue.
Unfortunately, it's only available on master as of now.
Is there any chance that this commit can be picked into r1.0 branch for the next minor release?

Thanks for your mentions.
I have fixed it manually before, but to run distributed training more and more bugs will be found with r1.0.1. It seems that the distributed training demo have not been updated for long time.  Hope for some more improvements.

, could you take a look if there is anything new we need to do to update the example?

		It looks like these were never fixed after  was replaced by  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/059ccad4d4bac851da9fa9694c23dd49a4089bc6&gt;059ccad&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I'm not sure what all the changes were between these two versions, but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jmchen-g&gt;@jmchen-g&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should be.

		The new version of sync opt doesn't need any clean up op so you can safely remove them in the training code.

		So just to be clear, I was able to modify /tensorflow/contrib/slim/python/slim/learning.py and remove this:
if isinstance(sync_optimizer,
sync_replicas_optimizer.SyncReplicasOptimizer):
cleanup_op = sync_optimizer.get_clean_up_op()
Is the suggestion going forward to replace the SyncReplicasOptimizer() with SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 in models/slim/train_image_classifier.py when SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 is added to a release?
I was able to run synchronous distributed tf-1.0.1 with the above lines commented out in learning.py and it ran as expected.

 Interested in submitting a pull request to remove the obsolete code?

		It looks like  has been removed in commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/74514bffc4bbac7e6717e1079aca055b1c837229&gt;74514bf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think this issue could be closed?

		Right. That op get_clean_up_op was gone for a while. This issue should be
closed.
