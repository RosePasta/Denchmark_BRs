	<summary>tf.split's -1 support doesn't handle zero dimensions</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes.
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colab
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Colab
TensorFlow version (use command below): ('unknown', '1.7.0') and 1.8.0
Python version: 3.6.3
Bazel version (if compiling from source): N/A
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): N/A
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A
Exact command to reproduce: tf.split(tf.zeros([0]), [0, -1], axis=-1)

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The variable size version of tf.split (SplitV in C++) allows one of the sizes to be -1.  The corresponding output will expand as necessary so that the total output size matches the input.
Unfortunately, the -1 support currently assumes the -1 dimension corresponds to positive size.  It should handle zero as well.  E.g., this should work, but it doesn't:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.split(tf.zeros([0]), [0, -1], axis=-1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/irving/anaconda/envs/openai/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py", line 1592, in _create_c_op
    c_op = c_api.TF_FinishOperation(op_desc)
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Sum of output sizes must match the size of the original Tensor along the split dimension or the sum of the positive sizes must be less if it contains a -1 for 'split_3' (op: 'SplitV') with input shapes: [0], [2], [] and with computed input tensors: input[1] = &lt;0 -1&gt;, input[2] = &lt;-1&gt;.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

By comparison, the positive case works fine:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.split(tf.zeros([1]), [0, -1], axis=-1)
[&lt;tf.Tensor 'split_4:0' shape=(0,) dtype=float32&gt;, &lt;tf.Tensor 'split_4:1' shape=(?,) dtype=float32&gt;]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Here's a colab exhibiting the problem, though since the repro is a single line it's not really necessary:

: Did you introduce this restriction?  Can't tell if &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/53f68459f18fd9c707183511e1e58d03e2f367db&gt;53f6845&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is yours.

		I sent a PR fixing this two weeks ago, so nagged me is unnecessary.  Hopefully the PR will be reviewed at some point.
