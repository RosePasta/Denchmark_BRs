	<summary>Python Tools Missing</summary>
	<description>
The tools found under tensorflow/python/tools are not packaged along with the pip package making them only usable through bazel (as demonstrated in their header documentation).  It's not clear to me how bazel is told which bits of python should be part of the pip package but these would be very useful to have access to from python code (ie: optimize_for_inference_lib).

		You can fix this by adding the appropriate files/targets to the pip_backage rule &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/BUILD#L34&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Basically, you want to add all the py_binary targets defined in tensorflow/python/tools/BUILD (but none of the tests.
I'd love a PR.

		Testing this out last week from master did install the tools as expected though I haven’t had a chance to track down the commit which added it to close this ticket yet.  Thank you.
