	<summary>Line break missing in tf.keras.Model.fit() documentation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;URL(s) with the issue:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=stable&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=stable&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the validation_data part of Model.fit(), the third alternative reads

dataset For the first two cases, batch_size must be provided. For the last case, validation_steps must be provided.

I feel a link break should be inserted after "dataset".

		In addition, I am not even sure that

For the first two cases, batch_size must be provided

is correct, because

If unspecified, batch_size will default to 32.

Similarly,

For the last case, validation_steps must be provided.

appears incorrect, as

If validation_data is a tf.data dataset and 'validation_steps' is None, validation will run until the validation_data dataset is exhausted.

So this whole statement can probably be dropped. (If not, 'validation_steps' should become validation_steps.)

		Thanks. This is fixed in tf nightly version and we can expect it in next stable release.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=nightly#arguments_3&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=nightly#arguments_3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Sorry for the late response. Again, this statement

If unspecified, batch_size will default to 32.

implies that this statement

For the first two cases, batch_size must be provided.

is maybe incorrect.
Also, why is the whole text

For the first two cases, batch_size must be provided.
For the last case, validation_steps could be provided.

in a code block?
