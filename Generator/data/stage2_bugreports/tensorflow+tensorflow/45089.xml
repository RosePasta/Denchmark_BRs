	<summary>Tensorflow 2. x not recognizing RTX 3090 GPU</summary>
	<description>
Please make sure that this is a build/installation issue. As per our GitHub Policy, we only address code/doc bugs, performance issues, feature requests and build/installation issues on GitHub. tag:build_template
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): 16.04
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
TensorFlow version: 2.2 / 2.3/ 2.5.0.dev20201028
Python version: 3.8
Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?: Pip
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version: 11.1/8.0.4
GPU model and memory: RTX 3090

I have installed T.F. 2.2 using conda install -C anaconda TensorFlow-gpu, it is installed properly but it is not able to recognize the GPU, I have checked using:-
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
device_lib.list_local_devices()
It gives output CPU only.
I have also checked by installing T.F. 2.3 and 2.5 nightly build using pip install but all of them are failed to recognize GPU. Does anyone know the cause and solution?

		try cuda10.1 and cudnn7.6.5 or compiling from source

 please answer something of which you are sure or else give idea having logic, don't spam. 3090 has Ampere architecture, CUDA 10.1 is incompatible. I have seen on some GitHub issues that there is a problem with compiling from source as well.

Please, see tested build configurations from &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Current tf-nightly version supports cuda 11.0
If you are okay with unstable version (tf-nightly) you can give it a try or wait for upcoming stable TF 2.4 release.Thanks!

 I have tried CUDA 11 on RTX 3090 but it throws sm_86 error with CUDA 11. I think only 11.1 works on it.
And I tried 11.1 + TF 2.5.0.dev20201028, it hasn't detected the GPU

		Have you added the correct CUDA And CuDnn path in the console. I recommend you check that.
 SET PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.1\bin;%PATH% SET PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.1\extras\CUPTI\lib64;%PATH% SET PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.1\include;%PATH% SET PATH=C:\tools\cuda\bin;%PATH%
this folder can be changes according to where you have installed cuda and CuDNN. Just make sure to include all the sub folders such as extras and bin. Also if you want a bit of stability. You can install Tf 2.4. it works with my RTX 3070.
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.4.0rc2

 in your case does
from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
device_lib.list_local_devices()
gives the output a list having GPU also?

		Yes it does and also trains my own network.
It gives the output
[name: "/device:CPU:0" device_type: "CPU" memory_limit: 268435456 locality { } incarnation: 9648146130202569739 , name: "/device:GPU:0" device_type: "GPU" memory_limit: 6910041152 locality { bus_id: 1 links { } } incarnation: 8457418497758750663 physical_device_desc: "device: 0, name: GeForce RTX 3070, pci bus id: 0000:01:00.0, compute capability: 8.6" ]
Is the fix working. Please also give me a screen shot of - Type PATH in your command prompt window

 , Thanks for sharing the code output, I was just confirming if it was a code issue.
I'll try to add a path and give an update here.
I'm using Linux and will share the screenshot of PATH.

		It should be somewhat like this:

 thanks, ....my issue is resolved. It was a docker image problem, I was using docker which had drivers compatible with CUDA 10.
