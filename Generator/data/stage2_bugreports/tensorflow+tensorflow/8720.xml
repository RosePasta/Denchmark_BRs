	<summary>split not working correctly</summary>
	<description>
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model_input = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1, 10))
model_split = tf.split(model_input, [4], axis=1)[0]

input = np.zeros((1, 10))
session = tf.Session()
split = session.run(model_split, feed_dict = { model_input: input })

# the size of the evaluated tensor does not match the size of the tensor
assert split.shape == (1, 10)
assert model_split.get_shape() == (1, 4)

model_b = tf.zeros((1, 4))

# this is okay adding things of the same shape
session.run(model_b+model_b, feed_dict = { model_input: input })

# check that model_b and model_split have the same shape
assert model_b.get_shape() == model_split.get_shape()

# this line crashes because the shape of model_split + model_b are not compatible.
# although the assert just checked that the sized match. This is the error message:
#          InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): Incompatible shapes: [1,10] vs. [1,4]
session.run(model_split + model_b, feed_dict = { model_input: input })

		I found a work around. in the tf.split line split out the whole thing. tf.split(model_input, [4,6], axis=1)[0]

 this appears to be a bug.

		Fix in progress.  To be clear the line: model_split = tf.split(model_input, [4], axis=1)[0] shouldn't work; it would need to be model_split = tf.split(model_input, [10], axis=1)[0].  You will now get an error either when the op is created if the dimensions are known or at runtime if they are not.

		You can specify an unknown value with -1, but you can't specify N-1 sizes if you expect N outputs.

		This got fixed by the referenced commit.
