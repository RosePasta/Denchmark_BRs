Thanks for the bug report! Can you please provide the full list commands you used?
thanks for your reply! this is the commands i  @dansitu
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source):master
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 7.4.0

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
make -f tensorflow / lite / experimental / micro / tools / make / Makefile test_hello_world_test
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=mbed TAGS="CMSIS disco_f746ng" generate_hello_world_mbed_project
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

when i want create the folder for mbed, its report an error

		I was able to build the project successfully with the commands you gave. I followed these steps:


Clone the TensorFlow repo
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git


Change into the directory
cd tensorflow


Run the make command
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=mbed TAGS="CMSIS disco_f746ng" generate_hello_world_mbed_project


Some output is then printed. The last line of it is Finished patching kissfft.
After this, you should see the expected mbed folder here:
tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/mbed_cortex-m4/prj/hello_world/mbed/
Try deleting your tensorflow repository directory and following all of these steps again.
Warmly,
Dan

		Hi,
I can confirm I'm seeing the same issue too when building the code for disco_f746ng, and I can't figure why.
In my case, I'm building the micro-speech demo. I see the same error, i.e. a message concerning /bin/sh: 1: [[: not found and the ..q10p6.c file issue too, see here:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;user@linux1:~/development/tensorflow$ make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=mbed TAGS="CMSIS disco_f746ng" generate_micro_speech_mbed_project

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I too had make version 4.1, so I downloaded 4.2.1 from gnu, and built and installed it (and confirmed with make -v that it was indeed 4.2.1). I'm running Ubuntu too, but version 16.04.6 LTS in my case.
Any suggestions what it could be?
Many thanks!

		I can confirm the same issue on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS too.
Here were the steps:

		Hi Yooong,
Not yet, this was going to be my first mbed CLI program for the ST chip. I have used mbed CLI with other processors, and it was straightforward, just drag it to the drive, and mbed will program it (same as with the cloud version of mbed). Once this micro-speech demo compiles, I intend to modify it actually, since I wish to use it on the NUCLEO-F746ZG board, and not the discovery board (the processor is identical, just different package, and less pins).

		<comment id='16' author='Yooong-W' date='2019-09-09T02:29:45Z'>
		maybe you should try get the mbed folder from officially generated
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OtgVkytQBrEYIpJPsE8F6GUKHPBS3Xeb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

so you can skip that step, and use mbed-cli to compile a  . this can only solve the problem temporarily

		Hi Yooong,
Thank you for this, it worked to generate the .bin file for now. (For DISCO_F746NG, I will now try to see if it builds with NUCLEO_F746ZG flag instead, and see what I need to edit to do so.
I hope the error we mentioned can get resolved soon.

		I've put together a fix, but I'd love you to try it out before I publish it. Please try replacing line 25 of tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile with the following:
HOST_ARCH := $(shell if $(shell uname -m | grep -Eq 'i[345678]86'); then echo x86_32; else echo $(shell uname -m); fi)
This removes some bash-only keywords from the Makefile so it is more likely to work on non-bash shells.

		Hi,
I tried that line 25 mod, but I saw this:
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile clean
/bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: ";" unexpected
So, I edited line 25 to just state for now:
HOST_ARCH := x86_64
and then I don't get any error, and I was able to execute this successfully:
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile test_micro_speech_test
However the next line of the instructions is to type:
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=mbed TAGS="CMSIS disco_f746ng" generate_micro_speech_mbed_project
but when I do that, I see this:

There is no folder called tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/mbed_cortex-m4/prj/micro_speech/mbed/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/downloads/CMSIS_ext
I only see folders up to tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/mbed_cortex-m4/prj/micro_speech/mbed/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro

		Hi dansitu,
Thank you!!
I tried both of the fixes you suggested (the HOST_ARCH fix, and the mbed_makefile.inc fix) and together it is much better : ) Now it proceeds to correctly compile.
There were a few other minor changes that were needed to fully compile. Basically, the file
tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/mbed_cortex-m4/prj/micro_speech/mbed/ mbed-os/cmsis/TARGET_CORTEX_M/arm_math.h

void arm_mean_q15(
const q15_t * pSrc,
uint32_t blockSize,
q15_t * pResult);
After this, the mbed.bin file compiles successfully (I have not run it on the board though, since I do not own a Discovery board), to about 173436 bytes Flash, and 119464 bytes SRAM with the GCC ARM compiler I was using.
Also, the instructions on the page &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/examples/micro_speech&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/examples/micro_speech&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

need slight editing, at the  section, it needs changing from
This will result in the creation of a new folder:

to:
This will result in the creation of a new folder:
tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/gen/mbed_cortex-m4/prj/micro_speech/mbed
That is very minor of course.
Thank you so much for your support! Also thank you Yooong for helping too.

 ; thanks for your suggestions, I tried all of that and its works very well.
when i use mbed to compile,i got a new error,thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shabaz123&gt;@shabaz123&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , his Modification successfully solved this problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[ERROR] ./tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/downloads/cmsis/CMSIS/DSP/Source/BasicMathFunctions/arm_mult_q15.c:53:6: error: conflicting types for 'arm_mult_q15'

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

when i build the second example micro_speech , i find i have to fix the HOST_ARCH and use this command first.
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile test_micro_speech_test
and then fix mbed_makefile.inc, next use the command：
make -f tensorflow/lite/experimental/micro/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=mbed TAGS="CMSIS disco_f746ng" generate_micro_speech_mbed_project
if i fix both of them at first ,and then use the command, i will get the same error.
