	<summary>tf.unsorted_segment_sum exits without error message if segment_ids contains negative number.</summary>
	<description>
When running
tf.unsorted_segment_sum(data, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None)
and passing a tensor containing -1 as segment_ids, tensorflow just exits without error message. I'm on the current master.
Desired behavior in my case would be to these values are 'rejected', i. e. are not summed anywhere at all. Would it make sense to extend this method this way? And if not, can you give me an idea how to implement this behavior?

		Using -1 to reject is interesting, but it turns coding errors into silent incorrect behavior so I'm leery of doing it.  For now, you could replace -1s with a positive value represent an "ignored" class and then drop it.
It would be reasonable to add a boolean drop_negatives attr to ignore negative values, defaulted to false to preserve the existing error detection behavior.

		Ah, but the fact that it exits without the error message is a bad bug.
