	<summary>Aborted (core dumped) - tf 2.3, tf lite model converts but crashes on invoke</summary>
	<description>
Hey there!
I'm trying to convert StyleGan2 to TF lite. Currently, there seems to be an issue with invoking the synthesis blocks of the generator, so I've included a small model here which is just one synthesis block, to display the issue.
Converts fine in tf 2.3, with no issues. Then on attempting to invoke, I get the exit code
Process finished with exit code 134 (interrupted by signal 6: SIGABRT)
in Pycharm, and
Aborted (core dumped)
if running from the terminal.
Judging from the graph in Netron, seems there are 2 Flex ops (Conv2D on 4-dim tensors in NCHW format) and everything else is built-in ops.
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): source - conda
TensorFlow version (or github SHA if from source): converted with tf 2.3, tried to invoke on tf2.3 and tf-nightly


Here's a colab notebook which downloads the tflite model and attempts to invoke:

# Here is the code used to convert the model:

converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(synth_const)
        converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS, tf.lite.OpsSet.SELECT_TF_OPS]
        tflite_model = converter.convert()

        with tf.io.gfile.GFile('synth_const.tflite', 'wb') as f:
            f.write(tflite_model)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Attempted on both the SavedModel and the tf keras functional model.

Any idea what's going on or a possible fix for this? Should I be changing some of the ops to fit tf lite better in some way?

		Was able to reproduce the issue with TF v2.3 and TF-nightly. Please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/b87159411a0928f24889ceabea17e661/42923-tf-nightly.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I can confirm it that this abortion is because current multiplication operator partially supports 5-D dimension inputs. Sorry for that.

		Ah I see. Thanks very much for getting back to me. It seems I'll have to try and re-wire some things to make it compatible. In that case, I just have a couple of questions:

Are there any ops which are supported in 5D? Specifically, I'm wondering about the reshape and transpose operations.
Further down in the model, I use a reshape and padding op on 6D tensors. Would this be compatible?

		Have managed to figure this out using only 4D ops. Thanks!
