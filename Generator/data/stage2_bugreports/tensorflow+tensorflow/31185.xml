		What exactly are you looking for in the API? At the moment, we only officially support FP16 weights, which aren't exposed to clients in any visible way.

		I'm looking for the function equivalent to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/tools/benchmark/benchmark_tflite_model.cc#L226&gt;TFLite model benchmark allow_fp16 option&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I think that some additional code is required for supporting GPU delegations.
If needed, I want to submit PR including the additional code.

		The relaxed precision is for internal calculations, not for any external inputs, and we don't have any immediate plans for exposing fp16 inputs externally.
