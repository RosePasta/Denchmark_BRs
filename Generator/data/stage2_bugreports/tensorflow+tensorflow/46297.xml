	<summary>gtest headers result in conflicting clang-format requirements</summary>

While porting OPs from lite to micro, one of the intermediate steps results in test code copied over from lite that has gtest headers. While this code is not (and can not) be compiled for TFLM it still trips up the formatting checks as described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/46159#discussion_r553568396&gt;#46159 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Deleting these includes (the workaround in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/46159#discussion_r553568396&gt;#46159 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) works just fine and it would be nice to give pull request authors this feedback directly via the TF Micro CI instead of waiting for the change to be imported internally before the error is detected.
The overarching goal is to get to a place where if a pull request passes the external CI, it also passes the internal CI (unless the code that a PR is breaking is internal-only).
