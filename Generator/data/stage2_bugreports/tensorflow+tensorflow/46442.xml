	<summary>Can't link against TensorFlowLiteC.framework (iOS) when built on recent TF versions (regression)</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac OSX 11.1
Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below): master
Python version: 3.8.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source): 3.7.2 and 3.1.0
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): clang 12.0.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: N/A
GPU model and memory: N/A

Describe the current behavior
It looks like there might be a regression in the build system responsible for generating the  iOS library. I've bisected it to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3e9fccb0cb9a5f55a4e67e3011c20ff31c3cce67&gt;3e9fccb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which is a little odd since that's just a bazel version bump... I'm using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/am15h/tflite_flutter_plugin&gt;am15h/tflite_flutter_plugin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (which binds directly to the TFLite C API) and can build my own  successfully and use it with that plugin up until the aforementioned commit.
From &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3e9fccb0cb9a5f55a4e67e3011c20ff31c3cce67&gt;3e9fccb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 forward (bisection script provided below) I get the following link errors:

Encountered error while building for device.


Describe the expected behavior
I expect to be able to build a TensorFlowLiteC.framework and link against it from a Flutter application.
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
These steps must be run on an OSX machine.
If needed, install bazel versions 3.1.0 and 3.7.2:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(cd "~/.bazel/bin" &amp;&amp; curl -fLO https://releases.bazel.build/3.1.0/release/bazel-3.1.0-darwin-x86_64 &amp;&amp; chmod +x bazel-3.1.0-darwin-x86_64)
(cd "~/.bazel/bin" &amp;&amp; curl -fLO https://releases.bazel.build/3.7.2/release/bazel-3.7.2-darwin-x86_64 &amp;&amp; chmod +x bazel-3.7.2-darwin-x86_64)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Download &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/mgalgs/3a79a6aa4b9ca237e0bea047d2326550&gt;this gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to a  of your choosing, then:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd $WORKSPACE
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mgalgs/object_detection_flutter.git
cd &lt;tensorflow_dir&gt;
./configure  # answer yes when it asks about iOS support

# Checkout the breaker and you should see a build failure in our test app.
git checkout 3e9fccb0cb9a5f55a4e67e3011c20ff31c3cce67
APPDIR=$WORKSPACE/object_detection_flutter $WORKSPACE/tflite_ios_bisect.sh

# Now checkout the parent of the breaking commit and build again. Should succeed.
git checkout 3e9fccb0cb9a5f55a4e67e3011c20ff31c3cce67~
APPDIR=$WORKSPACE/object_detection_flutter $WORKSPACE/tflite_ios_bisect.sh
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

You can also run tflite_ios_bisect.sh with git bisect as documented at the top of the file. Theoretically you should land on the same breaking commit that I've indicated above...
