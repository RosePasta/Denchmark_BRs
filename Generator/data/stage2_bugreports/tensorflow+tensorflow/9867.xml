	<summary>distributed runtime leaking memory on windows</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): no
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
TensorFlow version (use command below): b'unknown' 1.1.0
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU model and memory:
Exact command to reproduce: follow https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The memory footprint for parameter server keep growing.
The cause is a memory leak in a windows specific path in grpc which is fixed here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/fa242cba900ece728d2910e7396d02ebab4ddb2c&gt;grpc/grpc@fa242cb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I filed the issue issue so others don't need to spend the time debugging it and as reason to update the grpc version.

 Looks like we should update grpc if that hasn't already happened.

		Thanks for figuring out the problem, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guschmue&gt;@guschmue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
!
I think updating gRPC is blocked by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/7466&gt;#7466&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which appears to be on hold because of a different(?) bug in gRPC on Windows: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/9826&gt;grpc/grpc#9826&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Handing this off to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jhseu&gt;@jhseu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, who is shepherding in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/7466&gt;#7466&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
