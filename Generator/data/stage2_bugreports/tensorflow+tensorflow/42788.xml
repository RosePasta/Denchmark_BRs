	<description>
I found issues about after convert to docs that generated extra notebook cell.

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification in Japanesse version

 The original notebook in docs-l10n repository does not include such an empty cell.
Is that a problem in Google's internal system building the documents from notebooks?

		Probably related to the  that we need to include in Colab. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/classification.ipynb&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/classification.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This block is stripped when imported into tensorflow.org.
But soon enough, Colab will default to TF 2 and we can remove these blocks throughout.
