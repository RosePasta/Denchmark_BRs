	<summary>Confusing documentation for tf.image.rgb_to_yuv</summary>
	<description>
The documentation for tf.image.rgb_to_yuv says "Outputs a tensor of the same shape as the images tensor, containing the YUV value of the pixels. The output is only well defined if the value in images are in [0,1]." Does that mean the RGB values should be [0,1]?
If so, the usage example added confusion:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = [[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
      [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]],
    [[7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
      [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]]]
tf.image.rgb_to_yuv(x)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Clearly, x does not lie in [0,1]

		There are two ways of representing an image:

[0, 255] pixel values range.
[0, 1] (as float) pixel values range

So you need to convert the input image into a float [0, 1] range.

 is the link to the  doc. The usage example was updated in the . It clearly says that

The output is only well defined if the value in images are in [0,1].

Please verify and close the issue if this was resolved for you. thanks!
