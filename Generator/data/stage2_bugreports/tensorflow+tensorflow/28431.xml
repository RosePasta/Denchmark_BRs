		After having a look at



tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/image/python/ops/sparse_image_warp.py


         Line 175
      in
      6096a8f






 batch_size, image_height, image_width, _ = image.get_shape().as_list() 





Found that as this functionality is currently being provided using numpy which requires the static shape of the shape.

		Hi, I've run into this issue as well.  In order to use sparse_image_warp() in a custom Keras layer, it throws an error because it is expecting numbers rather than dynamic tensor shapes (i.e. "None").  The error I received came from a similar chain:
File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/image/python/ops/sparse_image_warp.py", line 185, in sparse_image_warp
_expand_to_minibatch(flattened_grid_locations, batch_size), image.dtype)
File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/image/python/ops/sparse_image_warp.py", line 43, in _expand_to_minibatch
return np.tile(np.expand_dims(np_array, 0), tiles)
File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/shape_base.py", line 1236, in tile
shape_out = tuple(st for s, t in zip(c.shape, tup))
File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/shape_base.py", line 1236, in 
shape_out = tuple(st for s, t in zip(c.shape, tup))
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'NoneType'

 , Please post a new issue and provide all the information asked by the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The reason for this is we can focus on your specific configuration and problem since the root cause can be unrelated even though the error messages are similar. Thanks!
