&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description of issue (what needs changing):&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Clear description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Problem 1:
Could you provides the math model of the rnn?
Problem 2:   this is not return information about  the method of
get_initial_state(inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None).
and
how to define own get_initial_state ?
what is the connect between   state_size  and get_initial_state
Problem 3,
could  you write more clear about  arguments  of the methods:  call, build, get_initial_state,
such as the   dimension of them.  each dimension is what .
Problem 4:
is the  cell  defined layer by user ?
thanks!

  Can this issue be included for Google Code-in as a task ?

		If no one is working on it, I can take this task-up.

		I getting this issue since long back .. I posted but it seems no one is taking care this issue . TF1.X
version was pretty clear and return state as well. TF2.0 RNN document is not clear and the return type specially get_initial_state(inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None).
my issue n0  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34850&gt;#34850&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Dexter2389&gt;@Dexter2389&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 It would be great if you take care this issue and resolve it.
Hi, I am working on tensorflow 2.0 and getting an error at line 3 while running the model

lstm_cell =tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units=128)
lstm_cell = tf.nn.RNNCellDropoutWrapper(lstm_cell, output_keep_prob=0.5)
self._initial_state = lstm_cell.get_initial_state(128, tf.float32)

Got ERROR at line 3
ValueError: slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds. for 'strided_slice' (op: 'StridedSlice') with input shapes: [0], [1], [1], [1] and with computed input tensors: input[1] = &lt;0&gt;, input[2] = &lt;1&gt;, input[3] = &lt;1&gt;.
may I know why I am getting this error?

		The documentation for  has been significantly improved now.
It answers most of the ask in the original issue such as arguments of the methods: call, build, get_initial_state and more.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/RNN&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/RNN&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you.
