	<summary>passing labels=None to image_dataset_from_directory doesn't work</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): macOS
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): tf-nightly
TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-34068-g9a70ab8813 2.3.0-dev20200614
Python version: 3.7.7

Describe the current behavior
Gives an error:
ValueError: labels argument should be a list/tuple of integer labels, of the same size as the number of image files in the target directory. If you wish to infer the labels from the subdirectory names in the target directory, pass labels="inferred". If you wish to get a dataset that only contains images (no labels), pass labels=None.
Describe the expected behavior
Should return a dataset hat only contains images (like the error message says)
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf

train_images = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
    'images',
    labels=None,
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Was able to reproduce the issue, please find the gist of it &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/amahendrakar/4bb0f4d2439bbc4efc2e9d53a7ce6e4d/40462.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks!

		Perhaps you can use label_mode arg to achieve this.
train_images = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
                 '/content/cats_and_dogs_filtered/train',
                  label_mode = None)

 I think that's the right way to do it, but would also be nice if labels=None worked, or at least if the error message that comes up tells you the right way to do it. Right now it says "If you wish to get a dataset that only contains images (no labels), pass " which doesn't work.

 Agreed. As the error message suggests

ValueError: labels argument should be a list/tuple of integer labels, of the same size as the number of image files in the target directory. If you wish to infer the labels from the subdirectory names in the target directory, pass labels="inferred". If you wish to get a dataset that only contains images (no labels), pass labels=None.

As the error message suggests, passing labels=None as an argument should work but its not in this case.

		This is fixed with the latest tf-nightly. The error message has been updated to,
. . . If you wish to get a dataset that only contains images (no labels), pass `labels_mode=None`.
Thanks!

		It looks like label_mode has been misspelled as labels_mode.

		Ahh.. I see.. thanks for pointing that out.
Will fix it now.
