	<summary>tf.Keras.fit() runs forever with 0 samples</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): Yes
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip
TensorFlow version (use command below): v2.0.0-beta1-5101-gc75bb66a99 2.0.0-rc0
Python version: 3.7.4
CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a (CPU)

Describe the current behavior
Code runs forever although nothing is to be trained (no parameters, no data).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2019-08-30 15:50:26.413745: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:142] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2
Epoch 1/2
WARNING:tensorflow:The list of trainable weights is empty. Make sure that you are not setting model.trainable to False before compiling the model.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
Code stops pretty soon.
Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

shape = (10, 10, 1)
layer = layers.Input(shape)
model = models.Model(layer, layer)
model.compile(loss='mse')
data = np.zeros((0, *shape))
model.fit(x=data, y=data, epochs=2, verbose=2)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
It's somewhat annoying if you set the number of training samples to 0 by mistake before starting to train - you might not notice it for a while.

 I agree with you that there is an issue with . However, it was resolved in the . Please take a look at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/4ee3cac706b982b4a5b80328a764e224/tf_32117.ipynb&gt;gist here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It clearly throws  within 2 seconds.
I am closing the issue here. Please feel free to reopen if the issue persists again in the tf-nightly-2.0-preview. Thanks!

		This problem is not fixed in 2.0.0rc1. This may be expected, but I wanted to point it out.

 Thanks for finding this. I am reopening this as I could reproduce the issue with . I closed earlier as I didn't see any issue with .
Currently with , it throws a warning but runs forever as mentioned by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bersbersbers&gt;@bersbersbers&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Could you please confirm if you are still facing any issues.
As i have tried running the same code on tf-nightly and TF 2.1-rc1 and it works fine, please find the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/drive/1pQn6GLmHo6eyOngJKJUcGkXtX8yRRGkn#scrollTo=YsqkNpZ5TEdW&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		With tensorflow==2.1.0, I get an error, as expected:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;...
  File "training_utils.py", line 144, in finalize
    raise ValueError('Empty training data.')
ValueError: Empty training data.

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

		With TF 2.3, I don't get "Empty training data." any longer - I now get "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'logs' referenced before assignment" (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/38064&gt;#38064&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
