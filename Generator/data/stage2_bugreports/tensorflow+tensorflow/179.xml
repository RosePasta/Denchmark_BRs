	<summary>Typo in TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning docs</summary>
	<description>
I believe there is a typo. In the code snippet in that section, currently it states:
summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter('/tmp/mnist_logs', sess.graph)
But sess.graph is a Graph object and SummaryWriter expects a GraphDef object instead, so something like:
summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter('/tmp/mnist_logs', tf.Graph.as_graph_def(sess.graph))

		Yup, you are right -- should be sess.graph_def.  We'll try to fix this soon, thanks for the report!
