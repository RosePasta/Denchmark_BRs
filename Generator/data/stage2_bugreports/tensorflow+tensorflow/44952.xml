You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with:

TF 1.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
TF 2.0: python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"

Describe the current behavior
I have been having problems with the tensorflow function tensorflow.math.conj, which is supposed to return the complex conjugate (1+1j -&gt; 1-1j) of a tensor. The error that occurs is the following:
tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_driver.cc:939] could not synchronize on CUDA context: CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED: unspecified launch failure :: 0x00007FFF94A28E85 tensorflow::CurrentStackTrace
However, it seems that tf.math.real and tf.math.imag work as expected.
Describe the expected behavior
I expect the function to output the the complex conjugate (1+1j -&gt; 1-1j).
Standalone code to reproduce the issue
`import tensorflow as tf
a = tf.constant(1+1.j, dtype=tf.complex64)
b = tf.math.conj(a)'
Other info / logs Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to
I am able to perform every other tensorflow operation that I've tried, it's really only this issue that is giving me problems...

I have tried in colab with TF 2.3, nightly version() and i am not seeing any issue. Please, find the gist &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ravikyram/403a23a7985925249f82c5f63437e4ed/untitled522.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
