	<summary>Error in restoring the tensorflow model and metagraph while using seq2seq and attention model.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.0.0
Python version: 3.5.2
Bazel version (if compiling from source):No
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): 5.4.0
CUDA/cuDNN version: 8/7
GPU model and memory:GTX 1060X and 6GB
Exact command to reproduce:

I am using seq2seq model with attention mechanism for a chatbot as given in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Currie32/Chatbot-from-Movie-Dialogue/blob/master/Chatbot_Attention.ipynb&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I am able to train the model and save it but when I am trying to restore the model I am getting an error:
Code for loading the model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;with tf.Session() as sess:
        #try:
        saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('/media/saurabh/New Volume/nlp_ucf/project/model/model_0.ckpt.meta')
        saver.restore(sess, '/media/saurabh/New Volume/nlp_ucf/project/model/model_0.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The error I am getting is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:975] Creating TensorFlow device (/gpu:0) -&gt; (device: 0, name: GeForce GTX 1060, pci bus id: 0000:01:00.0)

    raise ValueError('No op named %s in defined operations.' % node.op)
ValueError: No op named attn_add_fun_f32f32f32 in defined operations.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am even unable to understand the error. Does anyone have any clue about it? I was able to find one more person with a similar issue on StackOverflow but couldn't understand what exactly is the solution?

		Euguene can you take a look?
The library code is pretty old, but relevant line seems to be  and I was able to dig it out at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_decoder_fn.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.0/tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/attention_decoder_fn.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

My understand was that calling the function should have added it to the graph at train time, so it puzzling a bit that on restore it cant find it.

		Try using a newer version of tensorflow for both saving and loading the graph
