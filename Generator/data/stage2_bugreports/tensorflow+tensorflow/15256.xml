	<summary>Problem about tf.data.Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices</summary>
	<description>
Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:

It must be a bug or a feature request.
The form below must be filled out.
It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.

Here's why we have that policy: TensorFlow developers respond to issues. We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack Overflow.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):Win10
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):source
TensorFlow version (use command below):1.4
Python version: 3.52
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
CUDA/cuDNN version:8.0,6.46
GPU model and memory:2GB
Exact command to reproduce:

You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I used the tf.data.Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices to built a dataset. But the website has no enought information.
Here's my code
    point_cloud_feature_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices(sparse_feature) point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size = 100000) point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.batch(batch_size = BATCH_SIZE) point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.repeat() iterator_feature = point_cloud_feature_dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
when I called the iterator_feature.get_nest(). It return 3 Tensors of shape [none,none,1]. Instead of a SparseTensor.  The input Sparse Tensor of dataset has a shape of [1000000,300000]. Each row is a example. I hope talents can replenish the Doc. Thanks!!
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.

		Could you elaborate a little bit more on what the problem is? Are you in a position to send a PR with more explanations?

		OK. thanks for your respond.
As the code I copy. When I call the iterator_feature.get_next(), it return (,,)
Are they represent the element's position,value and dense shape? I guess they are. I mean you could specific them. So that we can use the lib more convinient.

		In TensorFlow 1.5, we'll deprecate tf.data.Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices() and fold its behavior into tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(): you'll be able to use a tf.SparseTensor in place of a tf.Tensor in that API (and many more), and it will work better with batching etc. You can try this out by installing the tf-nightly PIP package, or building from source. You'll be able to write:
point_cloud_feature_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(sparse_feature)
point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size = 100000)
point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.batch(batch_size = BATCH_SIZE)
point_cloud_feature_dataset = point_cloud_feature_dataset.repeat()
iterator_feature = point_cloud_feature_dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()
For your current code, the Dataset.from_sparse_tensor_slices() source yields three tensors, representing the indices, values, and dense_shape of a sparse tensor. However, the batching will be incorrect, because it will apply to the indices, values, and dense_shape separately, and the resulting output of the iterator might not be a valid tf.SparseTensor.

		Thanks for your help. Now, SparseTensor can be put into the model easily.  But I got other bug like "index out of other" and "index repeat". I think I can fix it. And doesn't the tf-nightly have GPU-version.?It is a little bit slow....

		There's a tf-nightly-gpu package that includes the GPU build.

		I have try the GPU version,  but the tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices method doesn't support the sparse tensor. Will it be updated?

		Ah, I assume you are running on Windows? It doesn't look like the packages are pushed to PyPI, but you can directly install the packages from these URLs:

Python 3.5: https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/tf-nightly/job/tf-nightly-windows/M=windows-gpu,PY=35/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/cmake_build/tf_python/dist/tf_nightly_gpu-1.5.0.dev20171120-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
Python 3.6: http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/tf-nightly/job/tf-nightly-windows/M=windows-gpu,PY=36/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/cmake_build/tf_python/dist/tf_nightly_gpu-1.5.0.dev20171120-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl

		thanks! I have solved the problem by writing a custom input function. I will try it later.

		When I tried to open URLs. It failed because of not found. And I have searched the website,but didn't found it.

Does it be closed?

		Hmm, it looks like the Windows GPU Nightly is no longer being built. (I seem to recall that that build was taking a very long time, so maybe it was timing out or otherwise failingâ€”does that sound right, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/av8ramit&gt;@av8ramit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?)

 yes we had disabled the nightly windows build because of CUDA issues. I'll try and fix this.

		I work very well! Thanks! But this install pkg looks like doesn't include tensorboard.. I didn't find tensorboard.exe in Scripts. So I can't open it by CMD. Is there any other way to open tensorboard?
