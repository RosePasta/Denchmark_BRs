	<summary>NameError: name 'pre_incpeption' is not defined</summary>
	<description>
I already save the model into the folder and it gives me 2 files: (1) tf_model.h5 and (2) tf_model.preproc
but when I tried to load the predictor it gives me an error NameError: name 'pre_incpeption' is not defined.
Please help.
thank you.

		Thanks for letting me know about this.  This is a bug/typo.  It has just been fixed in the develop branch (but not tested yet) and will be included in the next release.
If you'd like to try out the fix now, you can install the develop version of ktrain with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install git+https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain@develop
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
