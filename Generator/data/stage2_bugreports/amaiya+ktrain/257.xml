	<summary>Multi-Label Text Classification</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Thanks a lot for providing this beautiful wrapper. I am wondering, if anything in multi-label accuracy calculation got changed while upgrading from 0.18.5 to 0.21.3?
Because I had an accuracy of at 97% for my app while training with 0.18.5 but it got reduced to 70% in 0.21.3. I haven't changed anything in data or code. It's the same set of data and code.
It seems the accuracy calculation method got changed for multi-label text classification?

		This is a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41114&gt;bug in TensorFlow 2.2 and 2.3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and not a  issue.  I've already reported it to them, and it is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41114#issuecomment-686778243&gt;fixed in TensorFlow 2.4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
As a temporary workaround, you can compile model to use binary_accuracy instead of accuracy.  Note that this is just a metrics issue.  The loss and performance of the model are not affected (and accuracy is not the best metric for multilabel classification anyways.)
