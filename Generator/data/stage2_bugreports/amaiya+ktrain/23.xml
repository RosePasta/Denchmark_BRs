	<summary>'stellargraph' should be included in the list of dependencies</summary>
	<description>
I installed ktrain but when I tried to import it, it told me that 'stellargraph' was not found as a dependency. It should be added to the setup.py

		Thanks - this is now fixed.
Note that stellargraph was removed as a dependency in ktrain v0.5.1 because it seems to install tensorflow 1.14 (CPU), which disrupts existing tensorflow-gpu 1.14 installations.  The problem here is that there was a remaining reference to external stellargraph dependency that was accidentally not removed.  It was just removed/fixed in ktrain v0.5.2, so the error should no longer appear.
