	<summary>explain currently only supports English</summary>
	<description>
Hey there,
at first thanks for providing such an awesome framework, it's nice to work with. I'll try to get some insights about what my model has learned, but I do work on german data. So I wanted to know, how it is possible, to fit the current text-explainer to also handle german or other languages, because I do not see why that only currently works for english.
Best,
Richard

   v0.6.0 is being released soon, and I'll try to enable this for non-English.  Thanks.

		thats nice, but I also wanted to  understand, why the current approach does not support english. As I understand the eli5 TextExplainer LIME approach is model agnostic, so does not care about anything but just sampling input data and checking the prediction change...

		Your understanding is correct.  I believe explain  was originally disabled (incorrectly) because languages like Chinese were not being tokenized properly within explain prior to invoking eli5.  This is now fixed in v0.6.1 (instead of 0.6.0 as I indicated before).   So, you should now be able to use explain with non-English text if you upgrade to v0.6.1. Thanks.
