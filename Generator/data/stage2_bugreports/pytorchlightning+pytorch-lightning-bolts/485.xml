	<summary>Pillow version</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Pillow version 8.0.1 doesnt seem to satisfy the requirements of the package, even though there is no specific version numbered required. With Pillow 8.0.1 installed, attempting to pip install pytorch-lightning-bolts["extra"] will try to uninstall (downgrade) the Pillow version. Maybe placing a minimum pillow version requirement would fix this?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; pip install pytorch-lightning-bolts["extra"]

Requirement already satisfied: Pillow in c:\users\simon\anaconda3\envs\pytorch\lib\site-packages (from pytorch-lightning-bolts[extra]) (8.0.1)
Collecting Pillow
  Downloading Pillow-7.2.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl (2.1 MB)

Installing collected packages: pyglet, Pillow, pytorch-lightning-bolts, opencv-python, gym
  Attempting uninstall: Pillow
    Found existing installation: Pillow 8.0.1
    Uninstalling Pillow-8.0.1:
      Successfully uninstalled Pillow-8.0.1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Install pytorch/lightning and Pillow 8.0.1 in a conda environment
pip install pytorch-lightning-bolts["extra"]

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.0): 1.1.2
OS (e.g., Linux): Windows
How you installed PyTorch (conda, pip, source): conda

		As I checked locally, I was able to reproduce the behaviour.

  Currently, Bolts doesn't specify any min version for  as you're aware. If you ran , you'll find out that  and  depend on , and it seems only  tries to downgrade  to .
As gym needs Pillow==7.2.0 (for some reason), I'd keep Bolts' requirement as is. Do you still think we should set the min requirement as Pillow==8.0 or something in Bolts?

		ah I see. didnt realize the gym requirement was Pillow&lt;=7.2.0. Probably best to keep Bolts as is then. Thanks for checking
