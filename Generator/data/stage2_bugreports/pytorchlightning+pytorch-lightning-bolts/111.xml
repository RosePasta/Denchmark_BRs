	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;🐛 Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Tests run using the minimal requirements hang and are eventually canceled by CI. When run with latest requirements, test complete in ~5 minutes
Following behavior has been observed

resnet128 gets stuck when run with all the tests, but not when you run pytest test_resnet.py
self_supervised hangs both as a group test and single test
gans fails when run with minimal requirements.txt
test_dev_dataset hangs when run as a group or as a single test

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
