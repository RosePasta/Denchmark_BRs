	<summary>`global` assignment in warnings.py</summary>
	<description>
I have observed that in pl_bolts.utils.warnings, global assignment is being used for MISSING_PACKAGE_WARNINGS which is causing CodeFactor to fail in CI tests. In my opinion, global assignment is not needed as MISSING_PACKAGE_WARNINGS is already initialized outside the function itself.



pytorch-lightning-bolts/pl_bolts/utils/warnings.py


         Line 20
      in
      02684ef






 global MISSING_PACKAGE_WARNINGS 








pytorch-lightning-bolts/pl_bolts/utils/warnings.py


        Lines 4 to 7
      in
      02684ef






 MISSING_PACKAGE_WARNINGS = {} 



 



 



 def warn_missing_pkg(pkg_name: str, pypi_name: str = None, extra_text: str = None, stdout_func=warnings.warn): 





Happy to send a PR, if it is okay to remove the global assignment. :)
