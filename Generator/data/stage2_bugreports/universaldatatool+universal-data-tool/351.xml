	<summary>Can't exit macOS app (v0.14.1) without force quit after starting a project</summary>
	<description>
Once I open any project in v0.14.1 of the macOS app, I can't quit the app anymore without force quitting. This happens in every situation I've tried except for the launch screen, which does quit properly. This issue did not occur in v0.13.2.

		Didn't occur in v0.13.2? Weird regression and pretty important, thanks for reporting!

		As of the latest release I've tried (v0.14.9, sorry, took a while to try again), this problem is no longer happening :)
