	<summary>The website hangs when opening a previously saved file</summary>
	<description>
While importing the data I have encountered that page become unresponsive. Steps I have followed:-

Edited a NER task, saved the labelled file.
Opened the file in UDT to modify some labels.

The tab in chrome becomes totally unresponsive I have to kill the process. In the dev tools I am getting the following error hope it helps.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;index.js:1 Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.

		Hi,

It was web version, I had annotated a small text file of about 250 words
for NER task. I reopened the file after downloading it in JSON format
because I wanted to modify some annotations, that's when I encountered this
issue.
