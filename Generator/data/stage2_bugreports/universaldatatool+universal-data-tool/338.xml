	<summary>macOS builds beyond v0.13.2?</summary>
	<description>
Hi, thanks for making UDT! I was wondering if there's a reason why there are no macOS .dmg installers for releases past v0.13.2? I installed that version and it prompts me to get v0.14.0, but there's no .dmg asset on that release.

		Most likely a problem with our build server, thanks for bringing it up! We plan on supporting MacOS into the future, the 0.14 release was just pretty big so a lot of small things broke, probably including the MacOS build!

		It seems v0.14.0 was just a fluke. v0.14.1 the mac dmg appears to be there!
