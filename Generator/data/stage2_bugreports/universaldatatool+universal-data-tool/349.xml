	<summary>Multi-label image classification not working in UI</summary>
	<description>
I've set up an image classification task where I set "Allow multiple labels per image?" to "Yes". However, UDT (14.1 on macOS and the web version) does not seem to recognize this: the UI looks the same sa it does for single-label classification, and even when I go back to images to add additional labels to them, only the latest one I click is preserved.
Here's my task specification:
{
    "interface": {
        "type": "image_classification",
        "labels": [
            {
                "id": "simple",
            },
            {
                "id": "ignore",
            },
            {
                "id": "ambiguous",
            },
            {
                "id": "partial",
            }
        ],
        "multiple": true
    },
    "samples": []
}
It's hard to show in a screenshot, but any time I select one of these labels, it unselects the ones I've previously selected (and immediately goes to the next image, which is also not desirable for multi-label classification):

How do I get UDT to let me select multiple of labels for one image? Thanks.

		Thanks for reporting &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/leonoverweel&gt;@leonoverweel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! This code was refactored for v0.14.0 and I'm sure it's making sure that we don't programmatically go to next after clicking a classification!
