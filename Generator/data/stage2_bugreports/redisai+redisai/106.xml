	<description>
RedisAI SCRIPTSET throws error when it finds len() in the script while PyTorch's torch script won't. Checking the length is a useful thing to have. Is this something we can't have without much hustle? Below is an error trace from RedisAI
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERR: 
undefined value len:
        max_detections = []
        should_break = False
        while detections_class.size(0) != 0 and not should_break:
            max_detections.append(detections_class[0].unsqueeze(0))
            if detections_class.size(0) == 1:
                should_break = True
            else:
                ious = bbox_iou(max_detections[-1], detections_class[1:], True)
                detections_class = detections_class[1:][ious &lt; nms_thresh]
        if len(max_detections) &gt; 0:
           ~~~ &lt;--- HERE
            output = torch.cat(max_detections)
    return output
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This may have something to do with the version of libtorch we use. Are you sure you're using the same version on either sides?

		I couldn't find a difference in the version I am using. I checked the CPP source and it couldn't be anything else. Perhaps what the binary get_deps.sh (1.0.1) is pulling is different than pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-1.0.1-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl. I'll try to reproduce it later today and verify again

		Could this be the root cause &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/13376&gt;pytorch/pytorch#13376&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? Anyway, also got hit by this.

		This will likely be solved when &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/issues/115&gt;#115&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is done.

		This is fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/141&gt;#141&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
