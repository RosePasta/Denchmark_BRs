	<summary>GPU Docker failed to start</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I have used Dockerfile-gpu to build a GPU docker. Docker build is successful, but Redis exiting with libcuda exception.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;1:M 14 May 09:14:25.215 # WARNING: The TCP backlog setting of 511 cannot be enforced because /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn is set to the lower value of 128.
1:M 14 May 09:14:25.215 # Server initialized
1:M 14 May 09:14:25.215 # WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background save may fail under low memory condition. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
1:M 14 May 09:14:25.215 # WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel. This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. To fix this issue run the command 'echo never &gt; /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.
1:M 14 May 09:14:25.216 # Module /usr/lib/redis/modules/redisai.so failed to load: libcuda.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
1:M 14 May 09:14:25.216 # Can't load module from /usr/lib/redis/modules/redisai.so: server aborting
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thank You,
Srijith

 Executed this command. nvidia-docker run -it redisai/redisai:gpu
In Dockerfile-gpu FROM changed to nvidia/cuda:10.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04 as i have Cuda 10.0.
Please find the docker build log here. &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://gist.github.com/srijiths/3db165c51ff2d6a5130958e5c73489d9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Towards the end of the log , doubtful about below statements.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- Found CUDA: /usr/local/cuda (found suitable version "10.0", minimum required is "7.0")
-- Caffe2: CUDA detected: 10.0
-- Caffe2: CUDA nvcc is: /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
-- Caffe2: CUDA toolkit directory: /usr/local/cuda
-- Caffe2: Header version is: 10.0
-- Found CUDNN: /usr/include
-- Found cuDNN: v7.5.0  (include: /usr/include, library: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn.so)
-- Automatic GPU detection failed. Building for common architectures.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Even i have tried with nvidia/cuda:9.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04, then Redis docker is coming up , but the process is not running in GPU.
Thank You,
Srijith
