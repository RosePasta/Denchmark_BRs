	<summary>Occasional parsing error in DAG</summary>
	<description>
The DAG parsing code needs to be audited because I encountered a crash in one instance and a few parsing errors under heavy load (tens of thousands of requests).

		Closing, the issue was triggered while testing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/482&gt;#482&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it consistently showed up in test/tests_dag:test_dagrun_ro_modelrun_scriptrun_resnet in the DAG parsing function in the stack trace.
After comparing the behavior in master, this seems to be a consequence of a memory issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/482&gt;#482&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that shows up while parsing but it originates from the new logic.
Will need to tackle this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/pull/482&gt;#482&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
