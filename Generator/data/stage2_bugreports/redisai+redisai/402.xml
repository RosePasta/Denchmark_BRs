	<summary>TENSORSET should free existing data</summary>
	<description>
RedisAI_TensorSet_RedisCommand calls to RAI_OpenKey_Tensor which validates that the key is empty or is a tensor. After parsing the args it sets the new value in the key, without releasing existing data if there is such.
If the is an unwated byproduct we should have a command like TENSORUPDATE

		Actually it does: when a new key is set, RAI_Tensor_DTFree is called on the old value (you can verify).
