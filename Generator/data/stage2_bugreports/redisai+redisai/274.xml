	<summary>memleak on RAI_ModelRunCtxAddBatch [batching PR]</summary>
	<description>
using  a no opt, malloc-libc built redis ( on redis make valgrind ):
and issuing the following on memleak-fix branch:
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;start redis instance&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;make -C opt DEBUG=1 valgrind
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

we have:

		up to now only one sure leak is there:
small bump on the end ( the memory of RAI_ModelRunCtxAddBatch's (batch input and ouput arrays) that was not free when it should )

		after consecutive runs we that there is a small difference between the start and end :

 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lantiga&gt;@lantiga&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just confirmed that on master the leak on  does not exist. This leak, even thought small, is added by the batching PR
master ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/commit/3d2fff3efab827b068dc8ab0d9495152cf35ce7d&gt;3d2fff3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Leak is gone as of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/commit/74dbbb5014a7a7e940ab8a089c77a7bca4527656&gt;74dbbb5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
