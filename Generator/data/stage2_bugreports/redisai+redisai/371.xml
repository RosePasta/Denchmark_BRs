	<summary>torch jit compiler crashes when defaults arguments to script functions lack type hints</summary>
	<description>
having a function with default parameters in torch script crashes the compiler and Redis server due to bad access error. The exception is not caught in the try-catch block.

dvir can you share a quick sample ? =) we can integrate on tests right away

		I think this may actually be a bug on the libtorch side.

		it is in the libtorch. do you want me to open them an issue? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues&gt;https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Let me take a look and ask someone from the core team

		So, a bit more context.
Syntax can be wrong, RedisAI doesn't crash but reports the error, however:
default parameters that are not type-annotated crash the interpreter.
So basically:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def foo(a, b=1):
    return a
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

crashes, but
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def foo(a, b:int = 1):
    return a
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

doesn't crash and actually succeeds.
There's nothing we can do in RedisAI but I'm trying to work at getting this fixed upstream.

		I have a fix in the PyTorch TorchScript interpreter: I'm going to open a PR shortly, hopefully it will be merged soon. I'll reference it here for us to track progress.
