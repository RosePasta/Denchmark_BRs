		For the records, this is due to memory being allocated using malloc on the libtorch_c side, but then freed with RedisModule_Free on the RedisAI side, when Redis is built with jemalloc.
Building Redis with malloc both on macOS and on Linux prevents the crash, but of course we're looking for a proper fix.
