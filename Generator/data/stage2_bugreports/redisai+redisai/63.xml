Steps:

Create a database without replication
Put some AI keys to the database
Enable replication
Slave will fail to sync from master:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:42.219 * Connecting to MASTER 172.31.1.242:25727
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:42.219 * MASTER &lt;-&gt; REPLICA sync started
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:42.220 * Non blocking connect for SYNC fired the event.
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:42.221 * Master replied to PING, replication can continue...
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:42.222 * Partial resynchronization not possible (no cached master)
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:48.364 * Full resync from master: cdbb5bc4e7c49589646c974370c0a49c58d1c665:14
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:48.365 * MASTER &lt;-&gt; REPLICA sync: receiving streamed RDB from master with EOF to parser
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:48.365 * MASTER &lt;-&gt; REPLICA sync: Flushing old data
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:48.365 * MASTER &lt;-&gt; REPLICA sync: Loading DB in memory
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:48.366 # The RDB file contains module data for the module type 'DL_TENSOR', that the responsible module is not able to load. Check for modules log above for additional clues.
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:48.366 # Short read error when parsing object
20664:S 22 Feb 2019 11:45:48.366 # Failed trying to load the MASTER synchronization DB from disk

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/madarariel&gt;@madarariel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for opening the issue.
Serialization and replication are features that we haven't supported yet. My plan is to straighten those up this coming week. I'm going to open a dedicated issue and reference this one.
