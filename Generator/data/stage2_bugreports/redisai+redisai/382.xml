	<summary>AI.SCRIPTRUN results are being replicated twice</summary>
	<description>
The results are being replicated on RAI_ModelRunScriptRunReply via RedisAI_ReplicateTensorSet and via RedisModule_ReplicateVerbatim within RedisAI_ScriptRun_RedisCommand.
I believe the call that should be removed is the RedisModule_ReplicateVerbatim given that RedisAI_ReplicateTensorSet will ensure determinism on slves in cases of on determisitic outputs ( like we have on modelrun )

		Yes, I agree. This is a leftover from the times when SCRIPT was not managed by the queue.
