	<summary>Error: internal error: invalid thread id</summary>
	<description>
Hi all,
is anyone encounter the problem "Error: internal error: invalid thread id" with LSTM model on TIMIT dataset.
I'm using the latest code (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK/commit/e1093b9537a2fb5a309b664ba31bacc810a56b53&gt;e1093b9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) of master branch.

Allocating matrices for forward and/or backward propagation.
Precomputing --&gt; 3 PreCompute nodes found.
NodeName: featNorm.xMean
NodeName: featNorm.xStdDev
NodeName: logPrior.Prior
minibatchiterator: epoch 0: frames [0..1124823](first utterance at frame 0), data subset 0 of 1, with 1 datapasses
requiredata: determined feature kind as 72-dimensional 'FBANK_D_A_Z' with frame shift 10.0 ms
Precomputing --&gt; Completed.
Set Max Temp Mem Size For Convolution Nodes to 0 samples.
Starting Epoch 1: learning rate per sample = 0.000100  effective momentum = 0.000000  momentum as time constant = 0.0 samples
