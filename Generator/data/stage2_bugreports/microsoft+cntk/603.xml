	<summary>write action doesn't work with CompositeDataReader</summary>
	<description>
DoWriteOutput in EvalActions.cpp tries to set the "randomize" variable of the reader configuration to "None", but "None" isn't a false value for bool types in the config (Config.h L264). I think it should be "false" instead.
