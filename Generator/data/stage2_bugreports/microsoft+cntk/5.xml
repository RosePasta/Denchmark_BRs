	<summary>Replace hard coded paths for libraries and include folders in projects with corresponding environment variables</summary>
	<description>
The projects reference many libraries that have already environment variables set upon installation.
Using the environment variables would make the projects and solution more tolerant to change in libraries.
For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\MPI\Include should be MSMPI_INC
