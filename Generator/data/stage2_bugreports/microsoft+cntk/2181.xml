	<summary>linux ubuntu 16.04 build from source with gcc 6.2 fails: Tests/UnitTests/V2LibraryTests/FunctionTests.cpp abs(double) ambiguous</summary>
	<description>
both top of tree and setting the checkout to V.2.0
I did not see this issue with the default ubuntu 16.04 compiler
I had to upgrade the compiler to get better avx512 support for other investigations
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;             from Tests/UnitTests/V2LibraryTests/FunctionTests.cpp:5:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Tests/UnitTests/V2LibraryTests/FunctionTests.cpp: In function 'void CNTK::Test::SetDropoutRate(const CNTK::DeviceDescriptor&amp;)':
Tests/UnitTests/V2LibraryTests/FunctionTests.cpp:1043:87: error: call of overloaded "abs(double)" is ambiguous
BOOST_TEST(abs(zeroCount(forwardFunc(dropout)) - dropoutRate*shape.TotalSize()) &lt; 100);
this is fixed by adding
#include 
and changing abs to fabs on the offending source line
v2.0 then hit
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK/issues/2025&gt;#2025&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK/pull/2104&gt;#2104&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

top of tree then builds fine
standard cntk script test stated in install instructions works

		Unfortunately we do not yet officially support gcc 6.2, currently supported version is 4.8.
If it is not too cumbersome for you, could you please create a pull request with this fix? Thank you very much!
