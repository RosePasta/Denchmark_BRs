	<summary>CNTK GPU EXE on non-GPU machines</summary>
	<description>
There seems to be a problem with running a GPU binary on non-GPU machines. I suggest to make MathCUDA a DLL that gets delay-loaded (which will fail in absence of CUDA drivers/libs, something we can catch and interpret as 0 GPUs available).

		And what do we do then? It is a no-gpu machine and we do CPU-only execution?
We have (will have) CPU only binaries. I think it is ok to expect people to run CPU-only in the absences of a GPU.

		No need. IfMathCUDA does not load, it is equivalent to not having a GPU.
