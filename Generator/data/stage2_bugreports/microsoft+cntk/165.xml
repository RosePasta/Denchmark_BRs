	<summary>Convolution code must verify imageLayout at runtime</summary>
	<description>
This is to track a bug. The GPU and CPU convolution code assumes different tensor layouts, i.e. models trained with one cannot be tested with the other. A warning is printed during class construction if this is attempted. It is a warning since under certain circumstances (MEL), this is OK. But we must add a hard error check inside the actual convolution function.
