	<summary>PennTreebankExample with noiseContrastiveEstimation</summary>
	<description>
When I run the PennTreebankExample with:
trainingCriterion = "noiseContrastiveEstimation"
It seems to work on GPU but it SegFaults on CPU.

		Seems to be running on CPU. Didn't get a SegFault on a machine with GPU (but executing the Debug_CPUONLY build). I will try next on a machine without a GPU.

		The example throws an assertion in CPUMatrix::LocateColumn. This happens on a non-GPU machine.
Marking this as a bug.
From the log:
`Post-processing network complete.
SGD using CPU.

TrainNodeClassBasedCrossEntropy = NCEBasedCrossEntropyWithSoftmax

EvalNodeClassBasedCrossEntrpy = ClassBasedCrossEntropyWithSoftmax
