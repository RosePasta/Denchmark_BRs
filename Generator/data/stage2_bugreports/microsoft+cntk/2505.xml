	<summary>Negative evaluation metric (classification_error)</summary>
	<description>
I'm training a model using cross_entropy_with_softmax as the loss and classification_error for the evaluation metric. After a few minibatches, the metric was calculated as -219100133361550.00 % x 102 after which the metric is fixed at 0.00% x &lt;no_of_samples&gt;. However, the loss is still slowly but consistently decreasing.
Considering how classification_error is calculated, should this be possible? Do I abort the training at this point?

		This indeed looks strange. Are you doing distributed training?

		No. I'm running on a single machine with 1 GPU.

		We need more details to track down the issue. Could you share a small repro?

 a repo with the training script and links to download the dataset. I haven't been able to reproduce the exact scenario described above, but the summary stats. for the loss and metric are occasionally computed to be very large.

		I've tried to replicate it several times but no luck, so closing for now.

		By "replicate it several times but no luck", you mean the metrics return to normal? Or it's still wrong and you can't fix it? If the latter, let's keep this issue open.

		I've been unable to get the metrics to go largely negative like before. I'll update if it happens again.

		Great. Then we will close this. Thanks!

 I have updated my &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/frankibem/cntk-issue&gt;repository&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and added a log file that shows the issue. It is consistently reoccurring and may be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK/issues/2691&gt;#2691&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi,
Unable to test my models on an Azure Standard NC6s_v2 (6 vcpus, 112 GB memory) with Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)' is a 'Windows Server 2016'
Need I to update the Nvidia Drivers due to Meltdown / Spectre?
Has this been reproduced by Microsoft?
Thanks in advance,

		@bartdotnet  can you open different issue, this is unrelated to this issue.

		Can you run uname -a to find out your VM kernel version? if it's 4.13.0-1005-azure, then you'll need NVidia driver 384.111
