	<summary>Tutorial2 issues with CNTK-2016-02-08-Windows-64bit-CPU-Only.zip binary install</summary>
	<description>
While 01_OneHidden runs properly using the binary install, 02_Convolution fails with the error "EXCEPTION occurred: ImageParameter should have 3 parameters [width, height, numChannels]."
Do I need to build CNTK from the latest source in order to run Tutorial2 without errors?
FYI: In order to run the first tutorial, I needed to add: labelMappingFile = "$DataDir$/SimpleMapping.txt." I suspect this is because I am using the older binary install.

		I was able to run the example from February 9 on GitHub with the current binary. It was rather frustrating that basic tutorials did not run properly with the suggested binary download. You can close this issue.

		Can you please post the latest binaries more frequently? The binaries from February 8 do not work with several of the examples and I would like to create a regression network with multiple outputs without having to build the binaries from source.

 Alexey, can you please check if it is possible to increase our binary release cadence?

		I finally broke down and built CNTK from source. Both examples from Tutorial 1 run properly. The first example from Tutorial 2 runs properly. When I run the Convolution example in Tutorial 2, I get an exception:
EXCEPTION occurred: Default convolution engine currently supports only HWC/legacy layout.
