	<summary>cntk.edit_distance_error not running on multi-GPU</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I tried to run cntk.edit_distance_error CTC implementation on 2 GPUs (nvidia Tesla M60 )  in Ubuntu 16.04 machine , but got following error :
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.py", line 200, in 
cv_freq=args['cvfreq'])
File "HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.py", line 149, in htk_lstm_truncated
train_and_test(network, trainer, train_source, test_source, minibatch_size, epoch_size, restore, model_path, cv_freq)
File "HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.py", line 116, in train_and_test
model_inputs_to_streams = cv_input_map, frequency=cv_freq)

super(TrainingSession, self).train(device)
File "/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/cntk/cntk_py.py", line 3312, in train
return _cntk_py.TrainingSession_train(self, computeDevice)
RuntimeError: SetDataLocation [CPUMatrix]: Cannot migrate the matrix between devices because it is a view.
======================================
Steps to Reproduce:
I have made some changes of the example &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Examples/Speech/AN4/Python/HTK_LSTM_Truncated_Distributed.py&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Examples/Speech/AN4/Python/HTK_LSTM_Truncated_Distributed.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to working on CTC imlementation. Please find the attached python implementation. Please note that I have used the dataset at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Examples/Speech/AN4/Data&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Examples/Speech/AN4/Data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

run following commands from console:
$ download the zip file and data from the stated location.
$ unzip the HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.zip
$ mpiexec --npernode 2 python HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.py
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/files/1393498/HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.zip&gt;HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Note: This code is running fine if we run it on single GPU
$ mpiexec --npernode 1 python HTK_LSTM_CTC_Truncated_Distributed.py
