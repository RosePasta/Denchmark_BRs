	<summary>Unable to run unit tests on CPU</summary>
	<description>
I tried running the unit tests using the Debug_CPU configuration and most of them fail.
I looked at the code and most use the "c_deviceIdZero" variable when selecting the device to allocate on. This is obviously wrong on CPU.
Also, I was quite surprised that while most tests fail, there is actually a GPU test which passes, but I don't even have a GPU on my machine ! The test is GPUSparseMatrixInnerProduct. I ignored the GPU test CPUMatrixDenseTimesSparseAsSparse since it doesn't do anything.
Maybe these issues will be resolved along with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK/issues/98&gt;#98&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Although some tests may run (and pass) on CPU builds, we currently only support Unit Tests for Windows Release GPU. We currently have a backlog item for this (CPU vs GPU tests)
