	<summary>Compile error with MKL</summary>
	<description>
The makefile does not find all MKL libraries. It fails with finding libiomp5.* (liomp5 flag).
I fixed this by copying these to a used path, but it should be fixed by searching for the correct path.
As an example for intel64 on Xeon:
MISSING_INTEL64_LIBS=$(find /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries*/linux/compiler/lib/intel64_lin)
Repeat for MIC and IA32

, as of today, CNTK supports MKL through a CNTK custom MKL library, which should also fix this error. Updated set up instructions are provided here, specifically in the section on "MKL":
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Setup-CNTK-on-Linux&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Setup-CNTK-on-Linux&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(and for Windows here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Setup-CNTK-on-Windows&gt;https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Setup-CNTK-on-Windows&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
Hope this helps, and please let us know if there's still an issue,
Mark

		Does this update include MKL based convolutions? See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK/issues/530&gt;#530&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Nope, sorry, not yet. This was basically an update on how we build with MKL. Let me if I can close this issue here.
Thanks, Mark
