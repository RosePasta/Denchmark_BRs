	<summary>Requirements for CPU on macOS</summary>
	<description>
These are the right requirements when on macOS (hence no NVIDIA, no GPU :(
sacred==0.7.3
#tensorflow-gpu==1.8.0
tensorflow == 1.8
librosa==0.6.2
scikit-image==0.13.1
soundfile==0.10.2
scikits.audiolab==0.11.0
lxml==4.2.1
musdb==0.2.3
museval==0.2.0
google
protobuf
Note that both  and  are needed - according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6341&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#6341&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you.

		I will add a notice that for non-GPU setups, you need to replace the TF version like you did.
Can you name me the google and protobuf version you end up with when doing this? Provided it works now?
I would like to fix the versions of the packages to avoid conflicts in the future when they are updated

		FYI I was able to make it work right out of the gate on a Linux system with libsndfile pre-installed, when using this requirements file with pip, in a completely new pip virtualenv (no other packages):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;numpy==1.15.4
sacred==0.7.3
tensorflow==1.8.0
librosa==0.6.2
scikit-image==0.13.1
soundfile==0.10.2
scikits.audiolab==0.11.0
lxml==4.2.1
musdb==0.2.3
museval==0.2.0
google==2.0.1
protobuf==3.4.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Could you verify this is okay to use on your end as well?
Thanks

 confirmed. Now I get the errors that I have in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/f90/Wave-U-Net/issues/9&gt;#9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so it's ok with this requirements.
