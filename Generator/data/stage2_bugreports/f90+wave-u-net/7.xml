I get this error while installing required scikits.audiolab
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /private/tmp/pip-install-BXHQz4/scikits.audiolab/
This is because scikits.audiolab needs libsndfile, so first of all this one must be installed:
brew install libsndfile

		Thanks for reporting this. I will include a notice in the readme file that libsndfile needs to be properly installed on your system previously to installing the required Python packages. Users can then refer to the libsndfile documentation for the installation, so I don't need to clutter my own instructions with this.
