	<summary>Training.py not running on GPU</summary>
	<description>
Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/f90&gt;@f90&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I have a GPU in my paperspace machine. I am trying to run  using the following command: . But the script runs only on CPU, not on GPU.
I have just forked this repo and executing the Training.py script.
How can I make sure that it runs on GPU.
I am a Pytorch guy, and trying to refactor the codebase for Pytorch. Please help.
Thak you

		Can you verify that you have tensorflow-gpu pip package installed and not tensorflow (which is the CPU-only version)? That would explain the problem since it would fall back to CPU in that case.
Also since this is a cloud service you are running it on, check whether the machine shows a GPU when running nvidia-smi in the same environment as the one you are running Training.py, maybe the GPU is not properly attached to the instance?

		I have both tensorflow and tensorflow-gpu pip package installed.
nvidia-smi shows the attached GPU to the same instance.
I am able to successfully run GPU enabled Pytorch scripts from the same environment on the same GPU.
I am trying to remove tensorflow and install only tensorflow-gpu now.

		Yes you should remove tensorflow if you have tensorflow-gpu installed already.
Otherwise you can also insert a small code snippet into Training.py to list the available GPU devices and see whether it's properly detected there.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/f90&gt;@f90&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Now the script runs on GPU but it throws the following ERROR after filling the shuffle buffer:

Any insights on this.

		This seems like an NVIDIA issue, not related to my code.
Whats your NVIDIA Driver, CUDA and CuDNN versions? Looks like cuDNN version might not be the right one. Tensorflow 1.8 requires CUDA 9, and I have installed cuDNN 7.5.0 alongside and it works. I also noticed your driver seems quite old according to the logs, maybe you can update that?

		Updating the Nvidia driver to version-396+ solved the issue. Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/f90&gt;@f90&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
