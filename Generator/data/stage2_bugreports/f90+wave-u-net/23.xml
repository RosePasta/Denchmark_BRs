		I need more information on when this error occurs. What command are you even running?
If i had to guess, it looks like the sacred library is not properly installed. Check you have installed all the Python packages as indicated in the requirements.txt file in the repository.

		Check if musdb_path setting in the configuration is pointing to the right path! Looks like the MUSDB library is trying to read your MUSDB dataset copy, but cannot find the audio files. It should point to the main MUSDB dataset folder, which has "test" and "train" subfolders in it. Then try executing again through the commandline

		I have done that. But i find the problem occurs in Datasets.py line 127.
The program can read something ,however not all data, especially  the " rate = track.rate ".

		I have test the sacred library and returned  tip message  "WARNING - 02_hello_config_dict - No observers have been added to this run".
Thank you for your help.

		Do you mean there was an issue with the sacred library and it is now resolved? How did you fix it?

		Sorry! I don't fix it. I just test the sacred library.

		What is your stempeg, musdb versions? Also why are you using Anaconda3 with Python 2.7, should it not be Anaconda2?

		<comment id='9' author='xdzhangxuejun' date='2019-01-02T14:41:40Z'>
		I find that  stempeg==0.1.3，musdb== 0.2.3 . I just build a environment with python==2.7.11 in
Anaconda3.

		I should install Anaconda2?

		I am not familiar with Anaconda so I don't know exactly what you need, it just looked suspicious? Also I have stempeg 0.1.4, maybe try that too

		Hi、I fix it.
Because of the program didn't find "ffprobe" command.
So、I install "FFMPEG"(&lt;denchmark-link:http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html&gt;http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), it work well.
