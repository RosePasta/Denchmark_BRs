	<summary>no logging handler for neon/data/image.py error</summary>
	<description>
Displayed on systems where users can't build imageset_decoder.so (no opencv, no pkg-config installed).  Since our root logger will not have been setup by the time we hit this code, we'll get the above mentioned error.
Short-term at least, we should convert this to a print statement so we can warn the user and carry on.
