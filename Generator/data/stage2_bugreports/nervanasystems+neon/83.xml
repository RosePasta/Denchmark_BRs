	<summary>gpu compatibility check util requires system installed pycuda</summary>
	<description>
HAS_MAXWELL_GPU check in makefile relies on call to neon/backends/util/check_gpu.py which is currently run outside of the virtualenv but depends on pycuda being installed.
Will likely replace this python/pycuda based check with small c++ util.
