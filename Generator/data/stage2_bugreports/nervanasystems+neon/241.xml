	<summary>Is there a batch_norm layer in your "example/alexnet.yaml"</summary>
	<description>
I read the file, and I find there's an annotation that tells me there's a batch_norm layer. However, according to the code, you haven't explicitly declare the batch_norm variable. Therefore, it seems that the batch_norm layer will not be initialized by default.

		Yes you are correct that the comment indicates batch norm and bias but only has bias in the actual network. We will edit that comment.

		The fix is lined up for v1.5.0 release.
