	<summary>kernel declaration differs from its actual calling arguments</summary>
	<description>
From neon/backends/kernels/ptx/sconv_fprop_K128_N128.ptx, we can see there is a parameter called param_CRST, which I think is supposed to represent C*R*S*T. However, in the actual calling code in neon/backends/convolution.py line 130, the argument is K*R*S*T.
Is it a typo or something? I believe the ptx declaration (which is generated from neon/backends/kernel_specs.py) should be param_KRST instead.

		You're right, it should be KRST in kernel_specs.  But as it's coded now,
those params are never actually used by name.  They're just there to
generate the signature.  Then the kernels are called with the driver api
and a packed struct.
In bprop, K and C are swapped so it is correct there.  Anyway, I'll change
it for better consistency.
I'll have a brand new set of more flexible direct conv kernels out soon.
