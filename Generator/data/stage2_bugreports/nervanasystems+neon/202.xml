	<summary>model.load_params failing to process 'neon.layers.recurrent.LSTM'</summary>
	<description>
Seems like recurrent layers are using different pattern and hack in neon/layers/container.py:69-70 doesn't really work.
Introduced in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon/commit/c10a2a5774e744efb91e3a62d095dfcef9e8c579&gt;c10a2a5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
