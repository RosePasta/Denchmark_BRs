&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Unable to open some *.avi files&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Platform: Windows Vista 32-bit, Python 2.7.5, OpenCV 2.4.7.2

Here is a code snippet that illustrates the bug:

&lt;pre&gt;import cv2
path = 'D:/Videos/'             # path to the following *.avi file
video = 'toy_plane_liftoff.avi' # http://cinelerra.org/footage/
vid = cv2.VideoCapture(path+video)
result = vid.isOpened()
print result
&lt;/pre&gt;

[result returns False for this avi]

No errors are generated but this avi does not open. However, it *does open* and display in Windows media player, VLC, mplayer, etc. Note, this is a short, test avi that can be downloaded from the link given in the comment.

		this is hard to reproduce and could already be solved since there were many ffmpeg and mjpeg additions since 2013
Should be reopened if such a problem still exist
