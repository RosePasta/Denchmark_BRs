	<summary>samples/cpp/kmeans.cpp: Invalid layout of "center"</summary>
	<description>
Sample code expects CV_32FC2 type, but it is CV_32FC1 with 2 cols.
Reproduced in Debug build only (catched by CV_DbgAssert()).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        for (i = 0; i &lt; centers.rows; ++i)
        {
            Point2f c = centers.at&lt;Point2f&gt;(i);     // &lt;=== problem is here
            circle( img, c, 40, colorTab[i], 1, LINE_AA );
        }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Changing declaration of centers:
-Mat centers;
+std::vector&lt;Point2f&gt; centers;
doesn't work (exception during kmeans() call).
Perhaps we should support this implicit conversion (via reshape).
