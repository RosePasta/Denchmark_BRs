	<summary>stereoCalibrate THIN_PRISM_MODEL number of parameters error</summary>
	<description>
If I use the function stereoCalibrate with CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL flag and without flags CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC or CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS I get the error:
called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'
what():  /tmp/binarydeb/ros-kinetic-opencv3-3.3.1/modules/calib3d/src/calibration.cpp:1333: error: (-5) Thin prism model must have 12 parameters in the distortion matrix in function cvCalibrateCamera2Internal
The reason is simple: stereoCalibrate always create a 14 parameters distortion matrix (line 1817 of opencv/modules/calib3d/src/calibration.cpp of tag 3.4.1) and send it to cvCalibrateCamera2Internal. So it is an internal incompatibility between stereoCalibrate and cvCalibrateCamera2Internal.

		In my case, I realized that I did not have the  distortion (s1, s2, s3, s4), but only had  distortion (k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6) and  distortion (p1, p2). &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html&gt;OpenCV calibration guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was useful for figuring out what kind of distortion I have.
So, I ended up using &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga3207604e4b1a1758aa66acb6ed5aa65d&gt;CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 only which enables these 8 distortion coefficients (radial and tangential).  Finally I had
