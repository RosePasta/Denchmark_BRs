&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Sample code of chamfer matching does not work for me&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hello, I got chamfermatching.cpp and sample code from OpenCV 2.4.9 and I am trying to make the algorithm to match characters. Please see my source files and testing images attached. I got below results:

The program can match e1.png in e2.png, minCost is 0.0626175. It can match e1.png in e1.png(match itself), minCost is 0.0730605. But it can also match e1.png in a.png, minCost is 0.0681643.

You see, this means the match is not good, it cannot distinguish letter a, letter e and bigger letter e. I did a little change to the code. Commenting or uncommenting Canny() lines in opencv_test.cpp has the similar results.

I doubt the problem is in the implementation of chamferMatching2() function. Its declaration is: CV_EXPORTS_W int chamferMatching2( Mat&amp; img, Mat&amp; templ, CV_OUT vector&lt;vector&lt;point&gt; &gt;&amp; results, CV_OUT vector&lt;float&gt;&amp; cost, double templScale=1, int maxMatches = 20, double minMatchDistance = 1.0, int padX = 3, int padY = 3, int scales = 5, double minScale = 0.6, double maxScale = 1.6, double orientationWeight = 0.5, double truncate = 20);

You see, there are a lot of default parameters. I doubt the problem exists here. Maybe I should adjust the default parameters? Can somebody give me some guide to fix the problem?

Thanks in advance!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hello there,

Since this is actually more a problem in configuring samples correctly you will get helped much faster at the Q&amp;A forum (http://answers.opencv.org/questions/) so please focus your question there. This place is only here to support people to find and solve internal bugs in the sourcecode.

Kind regards.

Hi Steven,
Please see http://answers.opencv.org/question/39269/ask-help-for-chamfer-matching-sample-code/
I firstly presented my question at the Q&amp;A forum, but it seems nobody can answer it. So I opened a ticket here. Please help me, it is really important to me.
