	<summary>"Template Matching" tutorial page -&amp;gt; Can't choose another image</summary>

I can't upload another image to your template matching tutorial page.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/dd1/tutorial_js_template_matching.html&gt;https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/dd1/tutorial_js_template_matching.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Other tutorial pages are working fine for me.
Please Fix :)
