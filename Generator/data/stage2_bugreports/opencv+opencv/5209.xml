		Looks like it is OpenCL 1.1 issue, there is no clCreateFromGLTexture call (clCreateFromGLTexture2D is available only).

		anyway, we should not fail with SEGFAULT.
It needs to be fixed.

		It's strange. You're running opegl-example-opengl_interop, and it crashed in cv::ogl::convertFromGLTexture2D(), so at least the call to cv::ogl::ocl::initializeContextFromGL() was successful. It means that

CL platform with "cl_khr_gl_sharing" extension was found;
Function clGetGLContextInfoKHR() pointer was found, and it is != NULL;
Call to clGetGLContextInfoKHR() was successful, and device (CL_CURRENT_DEVICE_FOR_GL_CONTEXT_KHR) was found;
CL/GL interop CL context was created and set as CV' CL default context.
Is there any problems with the working environment (CL GL GLX)? How can I reproduce the issue on my system? Can you provide the "clinfo" output?

		There is nothing strange, clCreateFromGLTexture is introduced in OpenCL 1.2.
Crash point is on libOpenCL.so wrapper, when it tries to communicate with ICD without such function (NVIDIA OpenCL implementation is v1.1).

		So, initialization is successful. We can check platform version and reject if &lt; 1.2; or check and try to select between clCreateFromGLTexture and clCreateFromGLTexture2D by version number. Which is more appropriate?

		I think the second one is preferable.

		I have same error. How to fix the problem?
Exception: OpenCV(4.5.0) /home/nvidia/Downloads/opencv-4.5.0/modules/core/src/opengl.cpp:1791: error: (-220:Unknown error code -220) OpenCL: clCreateFromGLTexture failed in function 'convertFromGLTexture2D'

 There is no crash in your case (not related to this issue). It is just an C++ exception (cv::Exception).
Please provide complete minimal reproducer and fill a new issue. Also include information about your OpenCL runtime (use  / ).
