&lt;/pre&gt;
I can see there already this trouble but I don't know haw to solve it.
Can you help me?

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;To avoid crash I have replace CV_Assert(..) by assert(..).
But the next is not so good because I have the following message  :
_Invalid background description file._

So I will find it.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hello Yannick,

Thank you for reporting the issue. Replacing CV_Assert to assert would'n help there=) If you could work on fix? a patch or a pull request in our repo would be very appreciated!

haartraining is deprecated and gone from OpenCV3 branch.
The bug was related to an old OpenCV version which is also deprecated.

I suggest closing this down.
