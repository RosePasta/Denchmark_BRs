OpenCV =&gt; 3.2.0
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu 16.04
OpenCV-Python =&gt; 3.2.0.7

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Flag option FEATURE_EXCHANGE in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/1c18b1d245a875565c9b9e49ccec901e9b516337/modules/photo/include/opencv2/photo.hpp#L751-L752&gt;photo.hpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does not correspond to the implemented MONOCHROME_TRANSFER in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/1c18b1d245a875565c9b9e49ccec901e9b516337/modules/photo/include/opencv2/photo.hpp#L81&gt;photo.hpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/05b15943d6a42c99e5f921b7dbaa8323f3c042c6/modules/photo/src/seamless_cloning_impl.cpp#L392&gt;seamless_cloning_impl.cpp &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
It seems like FEATURE_EXCHANGE should be renamed to MONOCHROME_TRANSFER.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import cv2
cv2.FEATURE_EXCHANGE
The former will output AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'FEATURE_EXCHANGE'

		Looks like the doc needs updating.
I glossed over the cited paper and it seems like "monochrome transfer" is a very specialized version of "feature exchange" in which only the transfer of texture is desired, and where the source patch is converted to monochrome (intensity) before using it in cloning.
I'm basing this on what's said in page 315 of the cited paper where they suggest converting to intensity before doing the feature exchange operation. The implementation under  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/05b15943d6a42c99e5f921b7dbaa8323f3c042c6/modules/photo/src/seamless_cloning_impl.cpp#L392&gt;seamless_cloning_impl.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does indeed convert the patch to monochrome before using it.
This would seem like a good correction to the doc:
"MONOCHROME_TRANSFER Easily replace certain features of one object by alternative features."
If my interpretation is wrong then please correct me :) but I suspect this proposed change would satisfy users.
