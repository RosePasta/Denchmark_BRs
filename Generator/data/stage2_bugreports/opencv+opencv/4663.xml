&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;dynamic 'opencv_world' fails to build&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CMake fails to configure if trying to build dynamic @opencv_world@ (@-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_opencv_world=ON@).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVGenConfig.cmake:84 (export):
  export called with target "opencv_world" which requires target "zlib" that
  is not in the export list.

  If the required target is not easy to reference in this call, consider
  using the APPEND option with multiple separate calls.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:538 (include)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Does it still happen on 2.4.8?
-   Affected version changed from 2.4.7 (latest release) to 2.4.8
    (latest release)
-   Status changed from New to Open
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I am seeing it too with 2.4.8.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;propose to use `add_library&lt;target OBJECT &gt;  sources)` mechanism available since cmake 2.8.8
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Vadim Pisarevsky on 2014-11-15 09:12&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;is this problem still valid?
-   Affected version changed from 2.4.8 (latest release) to 2.4.0 -
    2.4.8
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I'm still seeing the error with 2.4.9
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
