&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Cannot compile OpenCV 2.4.9 + CUDA 6 with clang on Mac OSX 10.9, SSE2 errors&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I am trying to compile OpenCV 2.4.9 and CUDA 6 with clang 5.1 on Mac OSX 10.9 64-bit, but I keep getting the following error:

&lt;pre&gt;/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/../lib/clang/5.1/include/emmintrin.h(1225): error: identifier "__builtin_ia32_movnti64" is undefined&lt;/pre&gt;

I've tracked the issue down to the files @opencv2/core/internal.hpp@ and @opencv2/core/types_c.h@ where SSE(2) support is checked. I looked at the @emmintrin.h@ file as well, and apparently @__builtin_ia32_movnti64@ is defined on 64-bit platforms (@__x86_64__@). I tried adding the @-msse2@ option to my CMakeLists.txt clang++ compiler flags, but without any luck. I managed to make it work by undefining @__SSE2__@ before it was used in @opencv2/core/internal.hpp@ and @opencv2/core/types_c.h@, but that's a temporary hack at best. Just to be sure, I ran @file libopencv_*@ on a couple of the OpenCV libraries (installed using Homebrew) to ensure they were compiled as 64-bit shared libraries. I can also resolve the issue by not adding STL headers in my @Utils.cu@ file.

Additionally, and if relevant, I was previously getting tons of "identifier undefined" errors such as @_Atomic@, @__c11_atomic_fetch_add@ and boost type_traits (see the attached file), but was able to resolve them by patching the @opencv2/core/operations.hpp@ according to "this resolved issue":http://code.opencv.org/issues/3469#note-3 (cvdef.h is not found on my system).

Is this an issue related to OpenCV? I cannot really tell, but after some extensive internet research and searching this issue page, I concluded this issue did not exist, or at least nobody has posted a solution. I included my CMakeLists.txt as well.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Roman, could you check this?
Thanks.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;We have got the same error here:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;__builtin_ia32_movnti64 is introduced in clang 3.4 what version are you using?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Stefano Fabri on 2014-09-25 17:49&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Anybody can try wtih clang, libsdtc++ 4.8 and cuda 6.5?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;this small fix

https://github.com/bhack/opencv/commit/32f6e1a554dea1849ee3a53fea171cbd5969ef41

(related to the link above and which got integrated into 2.4.10) about 10 days ago works for me with the following configuration:

@clang --version
Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0
Thread model: posix
@

@
clang -dumpversion
4.2.1
@

I have /usr/lib/libstdc++.6.0.9.dylib installed, so according to https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/abi.html
* GCC 4.2.0: libstdc++.so.6.0.9
* GCC 4.2.1: libstdc++.so.6.0.9 (See Note 3)
* GCC 4.2.2: libstdc++.so.6.0.9

version 4.2.1 of libstdc++is used in my case.
