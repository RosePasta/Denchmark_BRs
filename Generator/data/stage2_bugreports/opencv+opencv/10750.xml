&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to run the sample program "Smoothing Images" in java.  But get an error on HighGui.
HighGui seems to be in the source code but not in the build.  I will have to compile my own build.

		Should be fixed in "master" branch (by this large patch: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/10495&gt;#10495&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
You can get missed files here (rename them and put into the right directory near your sample): &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/3.4.0/modules/highgui/misc/java/src/java&gt;https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/3.4.0/modules/highgui/misc/java/src/java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
