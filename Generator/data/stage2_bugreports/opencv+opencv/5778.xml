	<summary>ippicv performance issue</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I noticed ippicv has been updated from ippicv_linux_20141027.tgz to ippicv_linux_20151201.tgz.
It seems to cause ipp_filter2D() of cv::Filter2D() regression about 4 times on my platform (intel Celeron CPU N3150 1.6GHz).
Could you please check it?
Thanks.
Yan Wang
