&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;OpenCV 2.4.3 video capture returns error of "select timeout"&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hi,

I recently installed OpenCV 2.4.3 using the following scripts: https://github.com/jayrambhia/Install-OpenCV/blob/master/Ubuntu/2.4/opencv2_4_3.sh under my newly installed ubuntu 12.04 (x86_64, Memory:5.8GB, Processor: Intel Core i7 CPU 920 @2.67GHz*8).

After successful compilation, I tried the example "video_homography" with my logitech webcam. The console first output a few lines of warning: "VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument" and then the video window pops up but every few seconds the frame will get stuck, with console output "select timeout".

I found similar problem report here: http://answers.opencv.org/question/3580/webcam-select-timeout-error-on-linux/.

Later I modified the video_homography.cpp by adding the following two line after line 133. 
@   capture.set(CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640);
    capture.set(CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480);
@
I recompiled and the "select timeout" problem stops showing up and no frame get stuck anymore, though the "VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument" still shows up.

Any idea why that happens?

Thanks!

Best,
Chen

		Since OpenCV2.4.3 there has been bug fixing for several of the video capturing systems. So let us close this down and revisit if new errors pop up.

		Same issue shows up in 2.4.9 as well. Any solution to this problem is much appreciated?

		At least verify with version 2.4.11 which is latest stable 2.4 release!

		Sorry, I attach some motion tracker LeapMotion.. And this is assigned to /dev/video0. So when I switch to /dev/video1 it's run as expected. I use ArchLinux btw.

		<comment id='7' author='opencv-pushbot' date='2015-10-20T07:35:44Z'>
		SO this means your ubuntu is indexing the wrong camera index, because it does work on video0?

		Getting the error in 2.4.11. The code is able to open the window after about 2 sec but the freezes with a distorted frame. Experienced the same error in 3.0.0 but it was failing to open the window at all, only displaying a series of select timeout statements. I am running it on BeagleBone Black Rev C and the kernel is 3.8.13-bone79. I am using a Logitech camera with a max resolution of 320x240 pixels. I am using v4l driver.

		OpenCV is already at 2.4.12 and at 3.1.0, so please first try the latest repository version to be sure nothing has been fixed in the meanwhile.

		Can you please assist with a link for the 2.4.12 version installation. So does this mean 2.4.12 is more stable than 2.4.11? I want to use cv bindings thats why im shunning out 3.1.0 because it only has cv2 bindings.

		o_O oh lord, even in 2.4.12, it is like the WORST idea ever to use the CV bindings. They are the old C-API which is outdated, not stable and by far something to stay away from in my opinion. Any reason why you cannot use the C++ API?

		I am working with python and converting the iris recognition code on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pctroll/computer-vision/tree/master/iris_recognition&gt;https://github.com/pctroll/computer-vision/tree/master/iris_recognition&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  to use cv2 bindings is something i am failing to do. If you can assist me with that. I am not really good with C++.

		I am sorry but I do not have the time to convert code for you. I can supply you a similar code in C++ which is from the OpenCV 3 Blueprints book, and which gives you a hint at what functions you might need.

		I have faced the same problem on beaglebone black.In my case scaling down the video resolution to 160x120 solved the problem.

		Thank you. I noticed that the bottleneck was on the USB port on BBB.
