&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;ORB feature detector crashes with AccessViolationException&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;When trying to to detect features on a large number of images, Orb::detectAndCompute() crashes from time to time with an AccessViolationException.
All my images are of the same size (256x256 pixels), it makes no difference if they contain random data or meaningful images.

I use Emgu.CV to call opencv from my c# program.

For the ORB detector, I use the following parameters:

nfeatures=1000, scaleFactor=1.2f, *nlevels=1*, edgeThreshold=0, firstLevel=0, WTA_K=2, scoreType=ORB::HARRIS_SCORE, *patchSize=32*

I was not able to reproduce the crash when I changed the patchSize to 31.

The crash happens after processing ~1000 images when processing the images in a sequential for-loop, but much faster (~20 images) when I try to process several images in parallel.

I was able to catch the exception in the VisualStudio debugger, but i have no experience in debugging unmanaged code. Please give me instructions how to extract additional information from the debugger, if neccessary.
Attached are screenshots from the debugger, showing the part of the code where the exception happens, and the local variables.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		I think I am experimenting the same issue. I created a small executable to reproduce the issue here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MiguelAlgaba/orb_bug&gt;https://github.com/MiguelAlgaba/orb_bug&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 , will look at this, and PR a fix for this. I already have in mind what the problem is.

 ,

Your test case works for me with latest github opencv:
$ ./bin/orb_bug
Finished without errors
Moreover, with some additional prints:
$ ./bin/orb_bug
Image size: 512 x 512
Keypoints: #4
Descriptors: 4 x 32
Finished without errors
Can give some more details ? Are you using latest github ?

 I tried with yesterday's master and was getting errors like the following:
orb_bug(23186,0x7fff7a94d300) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fa9e8f03cd8: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed.
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
Abort trap: 6
I will try pulling again from master to confirm if this is solved in the latest master

 could you share the image (i could not compile it with Code::Blocks)

 I just tried with the latest master version and I'm still getting this errors when I execute it several times:
miguelalgaba@build[master]$ ./bin/orb_bug
Segmentation fault: 11
miguelalgaba@build[master]$ ./bin/orb_bug
Segmentation fault: 11
miguelalgaba@build[master]$ ./bin/orb_bug

, we tried in a different machine and we are also getting "segmentation faults" and "abort trap 6 error messages". Our machine runs OS X 10.10.5 and our compiler is Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0 Thread. We are compiling in Release mode. I will try now compiling both OpenCV and this executable in Debug mode to see if we find something more

		We found that this error appears only when compiling OpenCV with the WITH_OPENCL flag set to true. When we set WITH_OPENCL=false, the program finishes without errors

 ,
Yep. This explains it ! And on my machine opencv with opencl enabled exposes more wierd things on other modules too.

		I'm using version 3.1 now and I get these crashes frequently on Windows in Debug builds (VS 2015 compiler) ... it happens less with opencl disabled but it still occurs.

, can you create small test to reproduce the issue and submit it as a pull-request?

Hello. I have managed to create a minimal test case that reproduces an orb feature extraction crash on my computer. It tries to extract orb descriptors from one single keypoint and that causes the program to crash. Please note that the crash happens whenever this keypoint is computed, it doesn't matter how many keypoints I send in.
Additional Info:

OpenCV 3.1 built with OpenCL support (but disabled in the code, see below)
Built with Visual Studio 2015, toolset 140, target platform 8.1

Code that reproduces the crash
`
#include &lt;opencv2\highgui.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2\features2d.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2\core\ocl.hpp&gt;
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	cv::ocl::setUseOpenCL(false);

	cv::Mat image = cv::Mat::zeros(cv::Size(1920, 1080), CV_8UC3);

	int nfeatures = 8000;
	float orbScaleFactor = 1.2f;
	int nlevels = 18;
	int edgeThreshold = 4;
	int firstLevel = 0;
	int WTA_K = 2;
	int scoreType = cv::ORB::HARRIS_SCORE;
	int patchSize = 47;
	int fastThreshold = 20;

	auto orb = cv::ORB::create(nfeatures, orbScaleFactor, nlevels, edgeThreshold, firstLevel, WTA_K, scoreType, patchSize, fastThreshold);

	std::vector&lt;cv::KeyPoint&gt; keypoints;
	cv::Mat descriptors;

	cv::KeyPoint kp;
	kp.pt.x = 443;
	kp.pt.y = 5;
	kp.size = 47;
	kp.angle = 53.4580612;
	kp.response = 0.0000470733867;
	kp.octave = 0;
	kp.class_id = -1;

	keypoints.push_back(kp);

	orb-&gt;compute(image, keypoints, descriptors);
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Full error message:
Exception thrown at 0x00007FFCDD4390C9 (opencv_world310.dll) in MyTests.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0x000000CCA73CBB28.
Proposed reason
From what I've seen during debugging, the crash occurs in the function computeOrbDescriptors(), in file orb.cpp, line 261. Somehow, the *(center + iy * step + ix) expression in the GET_VALUE macro returns a pointer to a memory location that is outside the imagePyramid mat.
To be even more clear: The vs2015 debugger tells me that the imagePyramid.datastart =0x000000CCA73CD060, and since the access violation occurred at 0x000000CCA73CBB28, the computed pointer sure looks to be located sligthly before the imagePyramid data in the memory.
Please contact me if you want me to provide more info.
