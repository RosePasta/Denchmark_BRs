	<summary>cvtColor on a 3 channel Matrix with a 4 channel convert option crashes OpenCV 2 &amp; 3 with IPP</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Please state the information for your system&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV version: 2.4 / 3.x
Host OS: Windows 7

I Assume this happens on all systems with IPP.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which part of the OpenCV library you got the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Examples:

imgproc, cvtColor (with ipp)

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

An assertion should be raised if trying to color convert an RGB matrix but asking an RGBA code.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Actual behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Bad memory access, process crashes.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Additional description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Without IPP it doesn't crash.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Code example to reproduce the issue / Steps to reproduce the issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tested it in cv2 python wrapper:
import cv2
import numpy
cv2.cvtColor(numpy.zeros((2043, 13234, 3), dtype='uint8'), 1)

		Maybe this check should be separated according to the different cases (3 or 4):

		I wish to work on this issue. Will let you know of progress made. Any leads will be highly appreciated.
Thanks.

		Done here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/aede58c6eca43fa0897f5739145e885b77073c26&gt;aede58c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please have a look and let me know if this is fine.

		I think the code has a few more of those ifs in other code path worth investigating. Feel free to see if it fixes it (I've added an example that crashes it without loading an image from disk).

		Yes, you are right. There are more instances where the check isn't strict enough. Should I change all those checks?

		The original problem has gone, but I made the conditions to be more strict.

		Decided to leave as is, since such strict checks break some existing code. E.g.:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cvtColor(image, img, COLOR_BGR2GRAY);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

where the actual conversion is determined via number of channels in source image and conversion code just says about destination format. This code works for image channels equal to either 3 or 4. But the checks will break this code and we will have to write:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cvtColor(image, img, image.channels() == 3 ? COLOR_BGR2GRAY : COLOR_BGRA2GRAY);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which is inconvenient.
