	<summary>Delaunay triangulation returns bad points</summary>
	<description>
class Subdiv2D implements delaunay triangulation.
One of constructors take a rect. Then you need to insert points. Then getTriangleList returns points of trinagles to you. But. Some points is not in the rect area. For example. An image 1280x1024. But you can take a point like this (-1117, 85). How can it be? I give a rect with (0, 0, width, heigh).
And. I have 2 images with faces. And each face have 69 points on it.
When I use triangulation, I take different count of trinagles of each face. Why?
Bug maybe?

		I am not working on this. I am a beginner and when I am asking doubts about this, I am told to first work on some projects. So, this information will be helpful for some other person.
Thanks! :)
