&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Crash on Mac OS X with fullscreen window&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Going fullscreen in a simple demo app causes a crash during a @imshow()@; here follows the simplified code, which works normally with a normal window, and the exception generated in case of fullscreen window.

&lt;pre&gt;
...
  cv::namedWindow(WIN_NAME, CV_WINDOW_NORMAL);
  cv::setWindowProperty(WIN_NAME, CV_WND_PROP_FULLSCREEN, CV_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN);
  cv::Mat camera, view, temp;
...
  imshow(WIN_NAME, view);
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The problem seems to lie in the @CVViev::setFrameSize@ method, which does not check for the presence of the @sliders@ selection in the window object. The bug seems to be present even on latest version, but I've not verified apart from reading code.

I've attached a simple patch, but maybe the check on layers needs to be added elsewhere in the @window_cocoa.mm@ file.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Aziz Baibabaev on 2014-08-14 09:21&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Can this patch be accepted? This has been a recurrent OSX issue in every release up to the latest (2.4.9) and I can confirm that this patch fixes it.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi,
Except if I did something wrong, I got the same issue on El Captain using opencv3.1 (installed using brew) and this bug is still there. Do you have any idea of what I could do to bypass it ?
Thanks for your help,
Stephane
