	<summary>CMake error if source or bin path contains "++"</summary>
	<description>
If the source or binary path in cmake contain the character sequence "++" (without quotation marks) I get a cmake error when trying to create a project for OpenCV 3.1:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVUtils.cmake:76 (if):
  if given arguments:

    "G:/Desktop/C++ projects/project" "MATCHES" "^G:/Desktop/C++ projects/sources" "OR"     "G:/Desktop/C++ projects/project" "MATCHES" "^G:/Desktop/C++ projects/project"

  Regular expression "^G:/Desktop/C++ projects/sources" cannot compile
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:437 (ocv_include_directories)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Apparently this line inside OpenCVUtils causes the problem:
if("${__abs_dir}" MATCHES "^${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR}" OR "${__abs_dir}" MATCHES "^${OpenCV_BINARY_DIR}")
I noticed the problem because I have a folder called "C++ Projects" where I keep C++ projects and libraries.

		The same problem seems to exist at line 94 in the same file.
I was able to work around the problem by replacing lines 76 and 94 with the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;string(REPLACE "++" "\\+\\+" __abs_dir_escaped ${__abs_dir})
string(REPLACE "++" "\\+\\+" OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR_ESCAPED ${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR})
string(REPLACE "++" "\\+\\+" OpenCV_BINARY_DIR_ESCAPED ${OpenCV_BINARY_DIR})
if("${__abs_dir_escaped}" MATCHES "^${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR_ESCAPED}" OR "${__abs_dir_escaped}" MATCHES "^${OpenCV_BINARY_DIR_ESCAPED}")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, I don't know if this is a very elegant solution and if there might not be other characters that cause a similar problem.

		I propose to use FIND like here:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;string(FIND "${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR}" "${__abs_dir}" strPosSrc)
string(FIND "${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR}" "${__abs_dir}" strPosBin)
if (strPosSrc EQUALS 0 OR strPosBin EQUALS 0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This issue has a low chance to be resolved.

In general there is no problem for user to use directories without "+", "spaces", "brackets", other special or non-ASCII symbols.
CMake language is not very powerful, so please don't make it unreadable by replacing one line to three lines + new temporary variables.
There are a lot of "broken" places (there are many build configurations, with and without 3rdparty parts).
Without automatic test for this, any related fixes will be broken again and again.

		People should tend to learn not to use spaces and symbols inside paths used for software programming or handling. It tends to break a lot more than just CMAKE so just stay away from it. Most simple solution is to make a folder like c:/projects/cpp/ or something similar and all your issues are gone...
