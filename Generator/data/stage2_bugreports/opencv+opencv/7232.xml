	<summary>3rdparty: libpng build fails on VS2012</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; master ( 5540176 )
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 7 64bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2012 Update 5

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

libpng build fails on filter_sse2_intrinsics.c.
The direct cause is that filter_sse2_intrinsics.c has extention c when it's not following C89, such as following.
static void store3(void* p, __m128i v) {
   /* We'll pull from SSE as a 32-bit int, then write
    * its bottom two bytes, then its third byte.
    */
   png_uint_32 v012;
   store4(&amp;v012, v);     /* In C89, no more variable are allowed to declare after this line */
                         /*                                                                 */
   png_uint_16* p01 = p; /* which happens here                                              */
   png_byte*    p2  = (png_byte*)(p01+1);
   *p01 = v012;
   *p2  = v012 &gt;&gt; 16;
}
I just searched on this problem, and it seems that &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9903582/error-c2275-illegal-use-of-this-type-as-an-expression&gt;from VS2013 and later, this strict has been loosened&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Build any revision after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/554017673a09bd44b8f082ad12fae63b76c3d7e7&gt;5540176&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on VS2012
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Point of discussion&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since the cause is in libpng (external library), I'm not sure which way to fix.

rename filter_sse2_intrinsics.c to filter_sse2_intrinsics.cpp

This seems temporary fix
I'm not sure how other platform behaves under this condition


revert commit 5540176

This is one of the extreme approach
Although, it's promising.


configure libpng so it's build under standard which is later than C89

The main cause is the syntax part and not the logical part.  This file shuold be able to be compiled under something later than C89
Still, I'm not sure about the legal condition of libpng.  Are we allowed to import "modified" libpng in OpenCV ? Shouldn't libpng be "as is" ?


Drop support of VS2012

This is another extreme solution, but still, it's one of the solution.


Something else

Any idea ?
Best regards

 Does this patch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/7259&gt;#7259&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 work for you?

 sorry for late reply.
I confirmed that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/7259&gt;#7259&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/7295&gt;#7295&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 works well on VS2012.
I appreciate for your time.
