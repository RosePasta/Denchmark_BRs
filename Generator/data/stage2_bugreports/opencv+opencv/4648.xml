&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Python constant CV_CAP_PROP_SETTINGS missing&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The constant CV_CAP_PROP_SETTINGS defined in highgui_c.h is not available in the Python interface (either as cv2.CV_CAP_PROP_SETTINGS or cv2.cv.CV_CAP_PROP_SETTINGS)  However, using the value for the constant (current 37), its functionality works properly (only tested with a DirectShow camera, which uses the videoInput library).

Please add this constant to the Python interface.  I do not know anything about the source compilation process so I don't know where this probably simple fix would go.  I would also like that, as in Bug #3181, this constant be available in both the old (cv2.cv) and new(cv2) Python interfaces.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
