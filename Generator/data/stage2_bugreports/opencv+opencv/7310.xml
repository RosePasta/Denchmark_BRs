	<summary>the description of IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION is wrong</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I checked the following environment.

OpenCV =&gt; 3.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 10 64bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2013

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The description of &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d4/da8/group__imgcodecs.html#gga292d81be8d76901bff7988d18d2b42acad2548321c69ab9c0582fd51e75ace1d0&gt;document&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is as follows.

Default value is 3.

But,  is set to (=1) in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.1.0/modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_png.cpp#L407&gt;grfmt_png.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
So, I think that the description of  is wrong.

		Actually, I think this is a bug in the code itself, becaue the Z_BEST_SPEED is another parameter than the compression level. That one should be replaced.
But looking at the actual default value, on the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/1e17ffe9ac5bfa6cb834afdaffeab6f444c0a92e/modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_png.cpp#L381&gt;following line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we define the compression level for a first time as  since compression_level is by default -1, if the level is not specified explicitly, it will take the minimum value as Z_BEST_COMPRESSION. And that value is set to 9 by default &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/2f4e38c8313ff313de7c41141d56d945d91f47cf/3rdparty/zlib/zlib.h#L188&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The docs should thus state that the default value is 9, and not 3.
Can you provide a PR with a fix?

		Also, to my best understanding, i dont know if the second case, the else is actually ever hit inside the code



opencv/modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_png.cpp


         Line 400
      in
      1e17ffe






 else

		True, but the default value is still at 3 there while it is not by default right?

		Some of my thoughts:


Z_BEST_SPEED is indeed a constant specifying a compression setting, one of 4 conveniently defined in zlib.h.


The else block (see here) gets hit if you don't specify IMWRITE_PNG_COMPRESSION and the png compression level gets set to Z_BEST_SPEED, which is defined as #define Z_BEST_SPEED 1 in  (zlib). Hence, if we were to update the doc, it would be to say that the default compression level is 1.


Right?
