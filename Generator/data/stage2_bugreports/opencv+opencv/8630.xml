	<summary>MathJax CDN is shutting down</summary>
	<description>
OpenCV uses MathJax in its Doxygen documentation. Like most users, OpenCV links to an external copy of the library hosted at the official CDN, cdn.mathjax.com. MathJax is &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mathjax.org/cdn-shutting-down/&gt;shutting down&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 cdn.mathjax.org on April 31st.
OpenCV needs to either update the doxygen config to point at an &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mathjax.org/cdn-shutting-down/#alternative-cdn-providers&gt;alternative CDN&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  or self-host the mathjax libraries.
All the old documentation will need to be rebuilt as well.

		I've replaced all links in older documentation (3.0.0, 3.1.0, 3.2.0).
Thank you!
