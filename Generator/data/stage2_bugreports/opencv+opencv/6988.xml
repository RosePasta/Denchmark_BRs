	<summary>goodFeaturesToTrack() returns non-deterministic results</summary>
	<description>
When using OCL, the results of goodFeaturesToTrack() vary slightly from run to run.  This appears to be because the order of the results from the findCorners kernel depends on thread execution and the sorting function that is used at the end to rank the features only enforces are partial sort order.
This does not materially impact the quality of the results, but it makes it hard to build regression tests and generally introduces noise into the system that should be avoided.
An easy fix is to change the sort function to enforce a total sort on the features, even in cases where the match quality is exactly the same for two features.  I have a PR ready to fix this.
