	<summary>Add support for 32bit BMP with BMP_BITFIELDS compression</summary>
	<description>
For now it cannot be loaded while in
imgcodecs\src\grfmt_bmp.cpp, line 106 we see that such thing is not supported, only 16 bit BMP_BITFIELDS match condition.
While 32 bit are always 32 bit we not require check if m_bpp is changed.
But we require correctly set m_type (for now it's always 3 channel) while 32b BMP is with alpha-channel.
Have fix it in my own fork and will post pull request soon.
