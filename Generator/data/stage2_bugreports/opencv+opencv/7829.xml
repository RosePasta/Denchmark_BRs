	<summary>RGB2Luv black pixel artifacts.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 2.4.13
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2013

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Conversion from RGB2Luv creates image artifacts for near black pixels. This is due to a division by zero error present in the RGB2Luv_f struct in: 


opencv/modules/imgproc/src/color.cpp


         Line 5678
      in
      1c18b1d






 float d = 1.f/(whitept[0] + whitept[1]*15 + whitept[2]*3); 




. Here, (whitept[0] + whitept[1]*15 + whitept[2]*3) can equal zero, but no effort is done to check for a division by zero error. In cases where the sum of the whitepoints is zero, the resulting value for 'd' will yield a value of +INF. As the IEE 754 standard for floating point numbers defines 1.0F / 0.0F to be +INF.
A solution to this bug would be to simply check if: (whitept[0] + whitept[1]*15 + whitept[2]*3) is zero, and set 'd, u, and v' to be zero if it is. This solution is valid because: (whitept[0] + whitept[1]*15 + whitept[2]*3) is zero iff R, G, and B are zero for the original pixel.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Sample code attached. Run using parameters: "0.5 0.5 0.6 0.6 fruits.jpg out.bmp" with fruits.jpg being the commonly used fruits image at: &lt;denchmark-link:http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/YUTA/Cv-0.02/t/fruits.jpg&gt;http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/YUTA/Cv-0.02/t/fruits.jpg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 The main problem is not in OpenCV but in your code.
At Source.cpp:140 you wrote:

but the correct code is:

This replacement fixes all the artifacts on image you provided.
However there were several minor bugs in to/from Luv conversion which are to be fixed by PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/9098&gt;#9098&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
