	<summary>fisheyeTest.rectify: accuracy tests with different behaves between linux and windows</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 2.4.13
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu1404, Ubutnu1604, Window 10
Compiler =&gt; gcc 4.8.2, gcc 5.4.0 ,vs2015

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I complied opencv 2.4.13 on Ubuntu14.04(gcc 4.8.2 ), and ran the accuracy test opencv_test_calib3d.
But it failed in the test was fisheyeTest.rectify.
I also complied and ran tests on Ubuntu1604(gcc 5.4.0), but it failed again whith same reason.
But, the fisheyeTest.rectify test passed on win10(vs2015), which compiled with same srouce and run with same testdata.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		I can confirm this problem. This test doesn't provide identical results on the same system with different compilers (tested master branch on Linux with GCC 5.4 and 6.1), also this test writes into testdata folder - that practice is bad.
Workarond: reset "testdata" folder to initial state (something like this: cd opencv_extra; git clean -fdx).
