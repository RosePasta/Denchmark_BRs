How to get past this error for the make command? (all steps performed documented in attachment).
Thanks.

P.S. I have built OpenCV on many platforms previously.

		relates &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/13337&gt;#13337&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Add -DENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=OFF to CMake parameters (or disable EIGEN support or disable tests).

		in cmake-gui click "add entry"
then a in the pop up:
"name:" EIGEN_INCLUDE_PATH"
"type":PATH
"value": /usr/local/include/eigen3
Then configure and generate, that should fix it.

		goto your include directory see the tree.
if the like mine...
include/eigen3/Eigen and after that you can see Core files, so to fix it:
edit your privte.hpp in the:
home/chowkidar/projects/opencv/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/private.hpp
edit the line:
#  include &lt;Eigen/Core&gt;
become:
#  include &lt;eigen3/Eigen/Core&gt;
it should fix the problem

		Thanks again for all your help.
Changing the reference to the correct header file should work since the corrected one exists. (I won't have access to the desktop until Monday when I can report back). Also, turning off pre-compiled headers worked for me in a much older version (feedback from this site) and I will give that a try too separately. But the PATH statement did not work for me because that was my first individual attempt before posting the issue.
Please consider the issue closed. Kind regards.

		I see this issue is closed but the problem in the current master remains. It does not build out-of-the-box even with Eigen3 available (on ubuntu 18.04).

		Using default steps to download and install sources, changing the errant line to:
# include &lt;eigen3/Eigen/Core&gt;
solved my issue.
Kind regards.

		The root cause of the problem is incomplete support of precompiled headers. The best workaround is to turn them off: -DENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=OFF.

		Like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/baqwas&gt;@baqwas&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned, changing the line to below fixed the problem.

include &lt;eigen3/Eigen/Core&gt;

try sudo ln -s /usr/include/eigen3/Eigen /usr/include/Eigen

this is working for me, thanks

		Packagers might want to pass something like this to CMake:
-DEIGEN_INCLUDE_PATH="$(pkg-config --cflags-only-I eigen3 | sed 's/^-I//')"

		Still happening to me under Fedora 33
Seems to be mssing the dependency for eigen3-devel-3.3.8-2 at cmake
installed it manually and it worked after
