	<summary>cv::imread() goes to endless while() loop</summary>
	<description>
It seems that here is some problems with imread(). I try to load image
&lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12760584/15818591/53b42782-2bef-11e6-9633-c06c45238103.jpeg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but imread goes to endless loop while reading EXIF info of this file inside the ExifReader::getExif(). I think this is the problem with seeking forward-backward in file (bytesToSkip &lt; markerSize).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Version and paltform&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV version: 3.1.0
Host OS: Linux (Ubuntu 15.04)

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which part of the OpenCV library you got the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

reading an jpg image
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Code example to reproduce the issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

#include "opencv2/core.hpp"
#include "opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp"

using namespace cv;

int main()
{
    cv::Mat qq = cv::imread("Jessica_Collins.jpeg");
    return 0;
}

		After investigation, I found that the root cause of this issue is:
In function "getExif", both of the values for appMarker[0] and appMarker[1] are '\0', but it cannot match any of the termination condition. So endless loop will happen. I will create a PR soon for this issue.
