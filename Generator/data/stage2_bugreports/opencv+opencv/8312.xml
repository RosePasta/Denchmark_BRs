	<summary>OpenCV using C's math instead of C++'s cmath making build error</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.2.0
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Debian Stretch 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; GCC 6

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I was building OpenCV when I got this error - farneback_optical_flow.cpp:29:22: error: call of overloaded ‘abs(double&amp;)’ is ambiguous.
The fix was to add this #include &lt;cmath&gt; to the beginning of the file farneback_optical_flow.cpp.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Just pulled last master, did a complete build with tests and samples and works just fine... so I guess the issue is in using GCC6, because using GCC4.8 and GCC5 I get no issues.
