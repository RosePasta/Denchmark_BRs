	<summary>CUDA median_filter.cu: redundant #include precomp.hpp</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.2 20170512
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 10 64 bit
Compiler =&gt; VS2017 (VS2015 for nvcc)

&lt;denchmark-link:http://answers.opencv.org/question/122286/vs-2013-cannot-open-include-file-tbbtbbh-no-such-file-or-directory/&gt;+ Forum(VS2013)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/cudafilters/src/cuda/median_filter.cu&gt;/modules/cudafilters/src/cuda/median_filter.cu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 includes  which includes  which includes (when  is set), which is redundant and seems unclear why precompiled header is included in the first place.
And since TBB is not included in CUDA build scripts, when trying to generate cuda_compile_generated_median_filter.cu.obj it produces following error: fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'tbb/tbb.h': No such file or directory
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Build opencv WITH_CUDA and WITH_TBB.
