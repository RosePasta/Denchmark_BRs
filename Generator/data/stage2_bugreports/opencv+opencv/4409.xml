&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Missing breaks in switch statement in featuretracker.cpp&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;While trying to run samples/cpp/hybridtrackingsample.cpp, I found that no matter what I set the 'feature_type' of CvFeatureTrackerParms, I would always get an 'Unknown feature type' error at runtime.

I believe the issue is that the switch statement inside one of the constructors doesn't have any 'break' statements to prevent fall through to the default every time.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Also mentioned here with the suggested fix which seems to be correct:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13079098/opencv-error-at-hybridtrackingsample-cpp-sample

simple add the two omitted break statements:

@opencv-2.4.6$ diff modules/contrib/src/.bak.featuretracker.cpp modules/contrib/src/featuretracker.cpp
61a62
&gt;   break;
68a70
&gt;   break;
@
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This is no longer the case, since the tracking interface of features got moved and reshaped in the contrib repository. This can be closed.
