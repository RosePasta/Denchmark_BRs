	<summary>aarch64: too many warnings about 'fpic'</summary>
	<description>
When building recent OpenCV (including 3.4-rc), hundreds of warning ( cc1plus: warning: /home/firefly/opencv-fork/build/modules/ts/precomp.hpp.gch/opencv_ts_Release.gch: created and used with different settings of -fpic ) appears when using gcc 5.4.0 on Aarch64
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.4-rc (after #8198)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Jetson TX1, Jetson TX2, FireFly RK3399, PINE64, ODROID-C2 (All aarch64)
Compiler =&gt; All gcc 5.4.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The warning is just a warning, but it happens a lot during the build, for example more than 400 warnings during the build on Jetson TX1.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ grep warning:.*fpic arm-jetson-tx1-build.txt  | wc -l
411
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm not sure which to go, either

disable the warning
find out which compiler option is making this warning

Any suggestion, please ?
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Extra information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Looking on my local machines, it seems it only happens on GCC 5.4.0 on ARM64bit
I confirmed this doesn't happen on GCC 6.3.0, 4.9.2 (both on ARM64bit)
Unfortunately, I don't have other platform(x86, amd64) which uses gcc 5.4.0, so I'm not sure either the version or platform is causing this problem.

		The root cause of this problem is incomplete implementation of PCH generation in cmake scripts - header compilation flags are not in sync with sources compilation flags in some configurations.
