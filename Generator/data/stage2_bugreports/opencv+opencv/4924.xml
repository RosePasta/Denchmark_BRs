&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;cuda classes with cv::StereoMatcher interface should work as the other cv::StereoMatcher classes&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Their compute functions accept only cuda::GpuMat.
They don't return the same dimensions of disparity values as the cpu versions.

The caller have to know the actual implementation to call them properly, so the inheritance is useless at this time.

Is it a bug or by design?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-   Target version changed from 3.0 to Next Hackathon
-   Category changed from calibration, 3d to gpu (cuda)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

By design. CUDA API is a separate API and there is no goal to make them similar. CUDA uses different compute scheme and that is why some algos and functions have different semantic to make CUDA optimizations faster.
