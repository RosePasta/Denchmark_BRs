Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

only 8 colors here:

         Line 4464

 string colors[] = {"#ffffb3", "#fccde5", "#8dd3c7", "#bebada", "#80b1d3", "#fdb462", "#ff4848", "#b35151"}; 





but 9 colorId's used here:

 case DNN_TARGET_HDDL: out &lt;&lt; "HDDL"; colorId = 8; break; 





it's only in the master branch, 3.4 has it correct (6 colors / colorId's)
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Issue submission checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I report the issue, it's not a question


 I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues,
answers.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution


 I updated to latest OpenCV version and the issue is still there


 There is reproducer code and related data files: videos, images, onnx, etc
