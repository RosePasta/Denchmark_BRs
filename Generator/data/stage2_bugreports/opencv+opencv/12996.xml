I trained an object detection example model of pets by tensorflow (ubuntu 16.04 python 3.5 tensorflow 1.11.0).
I am trying to convert is to opencv.
I get the error

		Hi,
I do not find the template guide
How do I add reference to my .pb?
Thanks.

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I trained a model from object_detection samples faster_rcnn_resnet50 on oxford pets database. I got a pb file.
I want to do inference by opencv.
I am trying to get the pbtxt using tf_text_graph_faster_rcnn.py
I get
createFasterRCNNGraph(args.input, args.config, args.output)
File "D:\TFS\LPR\IP\MAIN\SRC\PythonProjects\TensorFlow\UseModelZoo\tf_text_graph_faster_rcnn.py", line 56, in createFasterRCNNGraph
assert(graph_def.node[0].op == 'Placeholder')
AssertionError
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

run tf_text_graph_faster_rcnn  on the pb and config in the below link
``
Link to my pb config and py files.

, it looks like that you serialized model in a wrong way. There are training only nodes:

		Thanks
I uploaded to Dropbox my checkpoints and FreezeGraphDogsCats.py which I use to create the pb file.
Can you tell what is wrong?

		Hi I also tried:

exporting the graph using export_inference_graph.py (part of the object_detection package).
creating the pbtxt using tf_text_graph_faster_rcnn.
When trying the opencv inference. I get C:\projects\opencv-python\opencv\modules\dnn\src\tensorflow\tf_importer.cpp:495: error: (-2:Unspecified error) Input layer not found: CropAndResize/Reshape/shape in function 'cv::dnn::experimental_dnn_34_v7::`anonymous-namespace'::TFImporter::connect'
I uploaded the frozen_inference_graph.pb and faster_rcnn_resnet50_pets_shay.pbtxt to the Dropbox link.
I tested the pb file - inferencing using python and tensorflow and it works.
