	<summary>Features2d.NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS in Java is missing in OpenCV 4</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 4.0.0-alpha, 4.0.0-beta
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu 16.04

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since OpenCV 4.0.0-alpha, I cannot use anymore Features2d.NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS with Java binding.
Is this intended since it looks like it is no more possible to call drawMatches with this flag parameter?
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/javadoc/org/opencv/features2d/Features2d.html&gt;3.4.3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there is:

But in &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0-beta/javadoc/org/opencv/features2d/Features2d.html&gt;4.0.0-beta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 there is only:

		Perhaps Java bindings are broken due "enum" changes.

		For what it's worth, I tried bisecting and it gave me this commit:
6ddef3b7a9a0d94ff85cd8dd6abb5f38adf8b97e is the first bad commit
Which seems to correspond to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/11516&gt;#11516&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		hello, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catree&gt;@catree&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, you probably meant the removal of this:



opencv/modules/features2d/misc/java/src/cpp/features2d_manual.hpp


        Lines 297 to 314
      in

 #endif 





(along with the whole features2d_manual.hpp) ?
i don't think, this is the cause. the commit was from may, and 3.4.3 release (which still had working flags) was in august.
it's probably more from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/12310/files#diff-17a1c50caf639a7abe392c3dfb1a1fdbR1185&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , where "named" enums were introduced. attempts were made for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/12678/files&gt;python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/12622/files&gt;js&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/12303/files&gt;java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 wrappers to handle this, maybe we need to check again, if the latter works properly.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/berak&gt;@berak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Pull request &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/11516&gt;#11516&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is only merged into master. 3.4.3 still has &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.4.3/modules/features2d/misc/java/src/cpp/features2d_manual.hpp&gt;features2d_manual.hpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I can confirm that  flag is ok with commit hash &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/68c92908d57f074c9e301c8f8f2419aaa0a3fe93&gt;68c9290&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and not ok with commit hash &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/4378b4d03d8415a132b6675883957243f95d75ee&gt;4378b4d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I don't know why this block was needed. Reintroducing this block does not solve the issue with the current Java wrapper and this enum struct. Tested quickly with something like:
features2d_manual.hpp:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#ifndef __OPENCV_FEATURES_2D_MANUAL_HPP__
#define __OPENCV_FEATURES_2D_MANUAL_HPP__

#include "opencv2/opencv_modules.hpp"

#ifdef HAVE_OPENCV_FEATURES2D
#include "opencv2/features2d.hpp"

#undef SIMPLEBLOB // to solve conflict with wincrypt.h on windows

namespace cv
{
#if 0
//DO NOT REMOVE! The block is required for sources parser
enum struct DrawMatchesFlags
{
  DEFAULT = 0, //!&lt; Output image matrix will be created (Mat::create),
               //!&lt; i.e. existing memory of output image may be reused.
               //!&lt; Two source image, matches and single keypoints will be drawn.
               //!&lt; For each keypoint only the center point will be drawn (without
               //!&lt; the circle around keypoint with keypoint size and orientation).
  DRAW_OVER_OUTIMG = 1, //!&lt; Output image matrix will not be created (Mat::create).
                        //!&lt; Matches will be drawn on existing content of output image.
  NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS = 2, //!&lt; Single keypoints will not be drawn.
  DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS = 4 //!&lt; For each keypoint the circle around keypoint with keypoint size and
                          //!&lt; orientation will be drawn.
};
CV_ENUM_FLAGS(DrawMatchesFlags);

CV_EXPORTS_AS(drawMatches2) void drawMatches( const Mat&amp; img1, const std::vector&lt;KeyPoint&gt;&amp; keypoints1,
                             const Mat&amp; img2, const std::vector&lt;KeyPoint&gt;&amp; keypoints2,
                             const std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;DMatch&gt; &gt;&amp; matches1to2, Mat&amp; outImg,
                             const Scalar&amp; matchColor=Scalar::all(-1), const Scalar&amp; singlePointColor=Scalar::all(-1),
                             const std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;char&gt; &gt;&amp; matchesMask=std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;char&gt; &gt;(), DrawMatchesFlags flags=DrawMatchesFlags::DEFAULT);

#endif // HAVE_OPENCV_FEATURES2D

		Please try this patch: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/13415&gt;#13415&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Names of these constants are changed, something like:

cv.DrawMatchesFlags_NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS
cv.DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS

In Java, the issue is still there.

Yes, it solves the issue. Thanks.
