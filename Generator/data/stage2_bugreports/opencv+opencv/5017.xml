&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;imgproc.Moments missing in OpenCV 3.0 for Android&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;imgproc.Moments seems to have disappeared in openCVLibrary300 for java.

Looking in Improc.java it says this:

// Return type 'Moments' is not supported, skipping the function
Same for huMoments

These were supported as of 2.4.11

In the 3.0 android distribution, the whole Moments.java file seems to be missing from the imgproc folder and bindings seem removed from Imgproc.java

This breaks a lot of working code.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Using Moments. it's just a short step from face- or color blob-detection algorithms to the corresponding centroid tracker algorithms that can drive robots very effectively. Fixing this bug quickly will open up a large set of new possibilities for autonomous robot guidance. Please hurry!

 I tried giving it a go today, but alas I'm having no luck with an implementation. Happy to buy you lunch (or a beer) via Paypal if you fix this problem soon. Cheers!

		I'm am using OpenCV 3.1 in an Android project.  I am finding that the moments() function is present in x86 -- the lib for the emulator architecture (macos), but not for armeabi-v7a, the lib for the Nexus or Samsung Galaxy architecture.
Appreciate the work around code.   When will this be fixed in the library?

I think i have the same problem like you, but i doesn't understand how to use work around to solve this.
What i did until now:
I copied the code from whatisor in Imgproc and this works fine without any errors.
I compared the code of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenCV-3.1.0-Android/blob/master/OpenCV/src/main/java/org/opencv/imgproc/Moments.java&gt;https://github.com/ctodobom/OpenCV-3.1.0-Android/blob/master/OpenCV/src/main/java/org/opencv/imgproc/Moments.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with mine and it matched.
Could you explain me what you did, tonyc10 ?
		</comment>
		<comment id='18' author='opencv-pushbot' date='2016-10-14T12:19:11Z'>
		PepperX -- I think you took the right steps.  The Moments should all be calculated correctly using whatisor's code.
Note that whatinor's method has a slightly different name/signature than the existing one.  Also, are you passing a valid contour (MatOfPoint) to the method?  What do the moments look like in the resulting Moment object?
		</comment>
		<comment id='19' author='opencv-pushbot' date='2016-10-25T06:42:06Z'>
		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tonyc10&gt;@tonyc10&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What is the right name/signature of the existing method ?
my declarations of MatOfPoint looks like:
List&lt;MatOfPoint&gt; contours = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
then with findcontours() and drawcontours() works well.
But with
List&lt;Moments&gt; mu = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(contours.size());
The problem begins.

		<comment id='20' author='opencv-pushbot' date='2016-10-25T18:36:51Z'>
		PepperX,
Prior to the workaround, to get the moments, you'd call the regular moments
method in Imgproc, namely
Imgproc.moment(Mat array);
That method doesn't work.  Whatisor's workaround is the new methods he
presents for Imgproc.
Imgproc.contourMoments(MapOfPoint contour);
I copied that into the version of Imgproc under the OpenCVLibrary310 module
in my project, and used that with a MatOfPoint contour to get the moments.
Hope that helps,
tonyc

Thx for your help again!
What you described is exactly what i did,
However i found another sollution:
A "new" Release of OpenCv is downloadable.
I don't know why, but the version number is 2.4.13 and smaller than 3.1
this version works well with moments.
Thanks @ all for your help :)
Have a nice day !
