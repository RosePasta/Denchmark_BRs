&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;cv::reduce - CV_REDUCE_MIN(MAX)  - failured&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cv::Mat src = cv::Mat::eye(4,4, CV_8U); 
std::vector&lt;int&gt; dst;

     --- this can pass
cv::reduce(src , dst , 0 , CV_REDUCE_SUM );
     --- this can pass
cv::reduce(src , dst , 0 , CV_REDUCE_AVG );      
     -- this cannot pass
cv::reduce(src , dst , 0 , CV_REDUCE_MIN , CV_32S);  
     --- this cannot pass
cv::reduce(src , dst , 0 , CV_REDUCE_MAX  , CV_32S);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hi,

Thank you for your bug report. As I can see cv::reduce doesn't support different types in case of CV_REDUCE_MIN and CV_REDUCE_MAX. I believe it can be a useful feature. Unfortunately our own resources are very limited at the moment. So if there is a chance you can look into this issue and propose a solution (please read http://www.code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute for more details) your help will be very appreciated!

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;i was just going to start working on that, then i started thinking:

does it really make sense to have different types for CV_REDUCE_MIN and CV_REDUCE_MAX ?

the value range does not change, unlike the CV_REDUCE_SUM case, where the dest-format has to be larger than src, and the CV_REDUCE_AVG case, where the dest-format should be float type to avoid truncation.

but, playing with the demo code above, i found out, that CV_32S is not supported for any op as src format. 

what might be the reason for that ?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
