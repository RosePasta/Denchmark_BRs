&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;opencv_world doesn't respect HIGHGUI_LIBRARY_DIRS&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;opencv_higui use pkg-config to find third party modules, and add them to HIGHGUI_LIBRARY_DIRS
but opencv_world ignore HIGHGUI_LIBRARY_DIRS, so these may lead to opencv_world link to different third party library.

for example, i have ffmpeg in /usr/local/lib as well as /another/dir, and i can override PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE to force use
ffmpeg from /another/dir. But opencv_world still link to ffmpeg from /usr/local/lib since it does not add the proper
-L/another/dir option to the linker.

i think this cause two problems:
1) opencv_world may link with different third party libraries compared with other opencv modules;
2) we can not set preferred third party libraries with opencv_world
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 since you supplied tons of fixes for the world module, do you think this is still the case?

		world build in 2.4 is not supported anymore (it was broken totally in 2.4.6-2.4.7)
