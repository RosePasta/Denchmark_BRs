	<summary>Replace the use of non-portable strcpy_s, strcat_s functions from window_w32.cpp</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 4.0
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 10 64 bit
Compiler =&gt; mingw-w64 GCC 8.1.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The use of strcpy_s and strcat_s in window_w32.cpp makes OpenCV impossible to build with GCC (on Windows) which doesn't have the optional _s functions from C11. I'm not an expert in C/C++ so I would suggest to replace the use of the above with strncpy and strncat which should be present in all compilers (MSVC, GCC, Clang).
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Try to build OpenCV 4.0 beta with mingw-w64 GCC 8.1 on Windows.
Thanks.

		Seems that the change from ,  to currently MSVC only functions ,  was done at this commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/e031bada7d0a474787411f05b6ce7a1b74d0b5e4#diff-baec79d9f6cf2a8b605a5d9aad326540&gt;e031bad#diff-baec79d9f6cf2a8b605a5d9aad326540&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We don't support MinGW build configuration. So we can't help with fixing/validation of this issue.
 is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strcpy&gt;https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strcpy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Reverting back to non "_s" function is not an option (our Windows MSVC builds must conform security requirements).
You can try to reuse strncpy() (bu it has NULL-termination issues).
Feel free to wrap these "_s" calls via macro:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#if (defined(__MINGW__) || defined(__MINGW32__)) \
    &amp;&amp; !defined(OPENCV_DONT_REDEFINE_STR_S_FUNCTIONS)
static inline mingw_strcpy_s(...) { .... }
#define strcpy_s mingw_strcpy_s
#define strcat_s ...
#endif
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and prepare PR onto 3.4 branch.

 Sorry but your link to &lt;denchmark-link:https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strcpy&gt;https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte/strcpy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just proves my point.  You sent me a link to the C standard not to a C++ standard.
strcpy_s is not even in the C++17 standard, true it is in the C11 standard and marked as optional to implement by the compiler.
From a C++ compiler point of view strcpy_s is just a non-standard extension.
