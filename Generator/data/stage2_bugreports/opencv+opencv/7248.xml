	<summary>BackgroundSubtractorMOG2: strange condition for OpenCL mode</summary>
	<description>
currently a single call to apply using Mat disables OpenCL for subsequent calls with UMat and reinitializes the class.
the big picture is that apply and getBackgroundImage must either both use OpenCL or neither of them.
However the decision is delayed until seeing the first frame which is either a UMat or a Mat. Furthermore it is assumed that all subsequent calls will use the same type.
Resolving this requires implementing the transferr of the internal representation (GMM) from host to device and vice versa.
