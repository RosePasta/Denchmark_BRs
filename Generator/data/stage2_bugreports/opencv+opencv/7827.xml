	<summary>SolvePnPRansac reprojectionError is the squared error</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; All
Compiler =&gt; All

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The reprojectionError parameter used by RANSAC to determine inliers is
interpreted as the squared reprojection error instead of the regular one.
The RANSAC code uses a squared threshold as we can see in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/c17afe0fab61bb11452b36fb94eaeb405293e086/modules/calib3d/src/ptsetreg.cpp#L94&gt;ptsetreg.cpp:94&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but the PnP callback uses normalizes the distance, as we see in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/05b15943d6a42c99e5f921b7dbaa8323f3c042c6/modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp#L200&gt;solvepnp.cpp:200&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 could you provide a PR which fixes it?

		Honestly, I have no idea where the fix should go, because there are three options:


RANSACPointSetRegistrator::find_inliers() should not square the threshold and then that's where the fix goes. However, I have no idea whether this would break something else.


PnPRansacCallback::computeError() should compute the squared error.


Both of the above, with the addition that the threshold should be expliticly squared by SolvePnPRansac() before passing it to RANSACPointSetRegistrator.

		I think the second variant is the most suitable since other Registrators use squared error.
