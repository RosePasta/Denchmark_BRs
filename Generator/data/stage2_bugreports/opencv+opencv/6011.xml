	<summary>build_framework.py , should we add -Wno-implicit-function-declaration flag ?</summary>
	<description>
I was unable to build opencv with contrib modules, the root cause was implicit function declaration.
I solved it by adding -Wno-implicit-function-declaration on the build_framework.py .
Is this known problem ? Can i submit PR to address this problem ?

		It is just a warning, real problem is not here.
I have this with contrib build:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    &lt;...&gt;clang++  &lt;...&gt; opencv_waldboost_detector
ld: library not found for -lopencv_core
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
