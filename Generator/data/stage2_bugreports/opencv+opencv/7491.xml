	<summary>Headers of module cudev are not installed if BUILD_opencv_world is ON</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1 (latest master)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 8.1 x64 Bit (actually system independent)
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2013 with CUDA 7.5 (actually compiler independent)

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The headers (such as cudev.hpp) will not be installed if the building option BUILD_opencv_world is set to ON.
The reason is that there is some error in the modules/cudev/CMakeLists.txt:
file(GLOB_RECURSE lib_hdrs "include/opencv2/*.hpp")
file(GLOB         lib_srcs "src/*.cpp")
And there should be ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR} in the paths. Or when building opencv_world, this script is executed in world's directory rather than in this directory and can not find the headers.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

To reproduce this bug is easy. Just open the CUDA support and specify to build opencv_world.
cmake -G "Any Generator" -DWITH_CUDA=ON -DBUILD_opencv_world=ON
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I will request a PR for this bug.
