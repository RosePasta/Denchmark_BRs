	<summary>error: 'nullptr' was not declared in this scope</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Solution:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=OFF
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu 16.04
Compiler =&gt; c++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.5) 5.4.0 20160609

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Building Opencv 3.3.1 with QT 5.7, VTK-9.0 produced the following message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Generating perf_precomp.hpp.gch/opencv_perf_dnn_Release.gch
In file included from /usr/local/include/vtk-9.0/vtkObject.h:48:0,

                 from /usr/local/include/vtk-9.0/vtkPolyDataAlgorithm.h:35,

/usr/local/include/vtk-9.0/vtkWeakPointerBase.h: In constructor ‘vtkWeakPointerBase::vtkWeakPointerBase()’:
/usr/local/include/vtk-9.0/vtkWeakPointerBase.h:39:33: error: ‘nullptr’ was not declared in this scope
   vtkWeakPointerBase() : Object(nullptr) {}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Unfortunately, cmake with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ENABLE_CXX11=YES
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

did not remove the errors.

Without precompiled header option enabled, the build time was much longer.
I think I saw a text about this problem of not applying C++11 to the case of precompiled headers, but cannot find the right link.
Anyway, OpenCV with VTK9.0, QT5.7 was built, without 'nullptr' error.

		Looks like VTK 9.0 requires C++11 support.
Please add failed command lines (via make VERBOSE=1) and attach CMakeCache.txt / CMakeVars.txt (at least parts about CXX_FLAGS)

		I am also getting the same error. How did you resolve this issue?

		It cannot be reproduced anymore with the following settings:

OpenCV master branch
VTK master branch
QT 5.6.0

		Thanks ENABLE_CXX11=YES solves my problem in mingw32 + qt 5.10.1
