&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;docs do not mention their license&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;We had a request for somebody that wanted to use the Haar picture in a book.

The docs should mention their license so that people know they can do whatever with them.

What is it anyway ? According to:
http://creativecommons.org/choose/
That would be:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Actually the Haar picture with the features is the one used in the publication, seen &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/modules/objdetect/doc/cascade_classification.html?highlight=cascade%20classifier&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We should not encourage people to use images generated in other publications, unless they reference it correctly. So I am not sure if it is good to add a license on that content.
