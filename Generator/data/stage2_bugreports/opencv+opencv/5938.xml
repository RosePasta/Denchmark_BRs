	<summary>Compiling OpenCV with Beignet OpenCL</summary>
	<description>
I've installed Beignet succesfully and have made it pass all tests and CLINFO indicates 20 work units etc. However, when I try to compile OpenCV, it says in Cmake that:
the include path is:
"/home/raaj/opencv/3rdparty/include/opencl/1.2"
When it should be:
/usr/local/include/CL/
How can I work around this? Is this a issue?

		There is no problem in case of custom OpenCL implementation is Khronos OpenCL 1.2 compatible (conformant). "Dynamic" OpenCL library loading is used by default.
To switch on your custom OpenCL run CMake (in the clean build dir) with these variables passed via command-line:

disable OpenCL auto detection: WITH_OPENCL=OFF
HAVE_OPENCL=ON
HAVE_OPENCL_STATIC=ON
OPENCL_LIBRARIES=/path/libOpenCL.so
OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS=/path/include

		Are you or anyone familiar with what those entries should be for Beignet? Especially Opencl_libraries. Beignet seems to install .so files to multiple locations

		Thanks, I got it to work now. Beignet is quite impressive, I can run DenseOpticalFlow and BGFG subtraction in real time with &lt; 20% CPU usage (It was over a 100% before that) on my Intel HD 4000
