&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;libv4l capturing backend diverged from v4l backend&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Currently, we have cap_v4l.cpp and cap_libv4l.cpp with a lot of duplicated code, but also some unwanted differences.

For instance, the recent addition of CV_CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC support to the v4l backend was not merged to the libv4l backend.

Do we really want to maintain both completely separately?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		this is why there are two different v4l implementations in the first place: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv_attic/commit/3f864089d315f6c76ca5147b47d8fa3a907cc8e6&gt;opencv/opencv_attic@3f86408&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

in retrospective that better should have been handled with a ifdef..
