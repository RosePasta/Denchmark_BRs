	<summary>lda::_dataAsRow not initialised</summary>
	<description>
I just had a failure where lda::project was transposing my matrices inexplicably.  On looking at the code I can see that _dataAsRow is never set to anything.
The docs specifically say:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/master/db/d59/classcv_1_1LDA.html#a6d654ebfab272bf734a6ffa35b3ce908&amp;gsc.tab=0&gt;http://docs.opencv.org/master/db/d59/classcv_1_1LDA.html#a6d654ebfab272bf734a6ffa35b3ce908&amp;gsc.tab=0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but this would require _dataAsRow being initialised to true.
