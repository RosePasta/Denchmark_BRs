&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Crash is CUDA code&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I am doing object detection from video stream usig cascadeclassifer_gpu.detectmultiscale function. There are no crashes with one thread. 

When I try to run multiple processing threads on GPU from the CPU. I have the following crashs in my program.

I ma using Windows/PThreads to spawn multiple-threads on the GPU. Each thread is independent of the others. It is processing a separate video file and loads its own cascadeclassifier. 

I am facing these issues for last 3 months and could not find a solution for it. Could any body from development team help me out for these crashes?



I have asked these crashing issues at OpenCV answers forum and did not get a reply.

All of the reported crashes occur when I try to run multiple processing threads on GPU from the CPU.I use Windows/PThreads to spawn multiple-threads on the GPU. Each thread is independent of the others. It is processing a separate video file and loads its own cascadeclassifier. It will be nice to have answer of all or some of these questions:

P.S: Setting priority as Blocker since above issue is not blocking my further development progress.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Dear Daniil,

Thanks for your reply.I can upload the video stream. My project is quite big and includes a number of other modules.
This is what I am trying to achieve.

Create 2+ threads on CPU for processing the video streams on GPU using Windows threads. 
Each thread loads its own cascade classifier and a separate video stream.

There is no crash with one processing thread. There is an occassional crash for 2 threads and the application crashes as soon as I start the 3rd processing thread on GPU.

I'll be happy to provide any further details for solving this problem.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I think that your crash is actually due to the scale space pyramid for detection being pushed to memory. Using multiple threads the will result into to much memory being allocated.
Is that possible?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;T Abdullah on 2014-07-14 14:46&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I don't think so as I am not running out of memory on the GPU.

There is 4GB GPU memory on my Tesla K20C. Only around 500MB of GPU memory is used at the time of crash.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Dear Daniil,
When would you be able to update?

 same here. Memory issues on the GPU cascade classifier referring to 2.4.8 should be closed until the re-emerge in 2.4.13 or 3.x
