	<summary>Open CV drawKeypoints binding broken</summary>
	<description>

OpenCV =&gt; 4.0.0
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Debian Buster 64-bit 4.18.0-2-amd64
Compiler =&gt;  gcc/g++

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi all,
With reference to this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/b5248da8267faca96da4c0c812b2f51f4dd237d2&gt;commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 a bug was introduced with Python bindings which stopped, as I currently know, the drawKeypoints binding from working.
I fixed this locally by re-appending the semi-colon, but as current my C++ knowledge is not good enough  I have only submitted an incomplete fix &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/VariableDeclared/opencv/commit/6c73812878b597adf757bbf060cefc8032592bf0&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Build latest stable 4.0.0 and attempt to use Python bindings using Python3.6.
