	<summary>Webcam light still on after cam.release()</summary>
	<description>
Expected behaviour
When releasing webcam, not only the webcam should be released but also the webcam light indicator should be turned off.
Actual behaviour
The webcam light keeps on even though the webcam is, in fact, released.
I am doing:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;webcam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
webcam.release()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After the release command, if I try to read the cam I get: (False, None) but the webcam itself is still &lt;VideoCapture 0EE62DC0&gt;. I don't know if this is the issue, but the light keeps on until I kill all python script or python terminal responsible to turn it on.
I am on a Windows 10, python 3.5, opencv 4.0.1. According to comments on my stackoverflow question (&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51974632/webcam-light-still-on-after-cam-release&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51974632/webcam-light-still-on-after-cam-release&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) other version also shows the issue (python 3.6 and opencv 3.4.2)
It seems that it was introduced in an earlier version because version 3.4.0.14 works fine.
I first opened the issue directly to opencv-python but according to its mantainer: "This repository is just an unofficial wrapper which generates python bindings automatically from OpenCV sources."

		Attach logs with OPENCV_VIDEOIO_DEBUG=1 environment variable.
Also try OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_MSMF=0 to disable MSMF.

		Same here. Win10 x64, Python 3.6 x64, OpenCV 3.4.2.
Code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import cv2
   
window = "OpenCV_window"
cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
print(cam, "is open:", cam.isOpened())

cv2.namedWindow(window)
ready, frame = cam.read()
print("Frame ready:", ready)

cv2.imshow(window, frame)
cv2.waitKey(1)
input("Press ENTER to close window and camera.") 

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
cam.release()

# light on Logitech C922 webcam remains on at this point

input("Press ENTER to exit Python.")  

# light on webcam goes off only after Python exits
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;C:\Users\Dave\data\Code\Python\VideoCapture&gt;python3 test.py
&lt;VideoCapture 0000023C055CDEF0&gt; is open: True
Frame ready: True
Press ENTER to close window and camera.
Press ENTER to exit Python.

C:\Users\Dave\data\Code\Python\VideoCapture&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Also try OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_MSMF=0 to disable MSMF.

That does fix it.

Attach logs with OPENCV_VIDEOIO_DEBUG=1 environment variable.

Not sure what you mean by "logs" (where are they?) but here's the output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;C:\Users\Dave\data\Code\Python\VideoCapture&gt;set OPENCV_VIDEOIO_DEBUG=1

C:\Users\Dave\data\Code\Python\VideoCapture&gt;python3 test.py
[ WARN:0] VIDEOIO(cvCreateCapture_MSMF(index)): trying ...

[ WARN:0] VIDEOIO(cvCreateCapture_MSMF(index)): result=000001FC77543C50 isOpened=1 ...

&lt;VideoCapture 000001FC7736DEF0&gt; is open: True
Frame ready: True
Press ENTER to close window and camera.
Press ENTER to exit Python.

C:\Users\Dave\data\Code\Python\VideoCapture&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Tell me where to find the logs and I'll post them. Or, just try it yourself.

		OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_MSMF = 0, it worked for me, but when I compile the program, will it work on other computers?

 It will work only if your program sets that environment variable. Try os.environ["OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_MSMF"] = "0" (I haven't tested it).
We were trying that only to narrow down the source of the problem (not as a workaround, but you may find it works well enough for you).

This does not work. The path is added to the running process. The path is not added globally.

		Same for me. I tracked it down to some refcounting issues in the MSMF capture backend, which I tried to fix. I'll submit a PR soon.

		I checked and it is due to the fact the kernel is still active. Close the kernel and light will go off!

		Hi, i have encountered the same problem in python 2.7 and openCV 3.4.2. There are 2 different scripts executed one after the other and both require camera source for individual purposes but since the light doesn't turn off after first script is executed the second script shows error while reading the camera.
Also the 2 scripts are called by one master script on click of separate buttons.
Error
[ WARN:0] videoio(MSMF): OnReadSample() is called with error status: -1072875772
[ WARN:0] videoio(MSMF): async ReadSample() call is failed with error status: -1072875772
[ WARN:1] videoio(MSMF): can't grab frame. Error: -1072875772
Traceback (most recent call last):
pls tell me what all is to be set and do the variables to be set in the starting of script??

Hi i have set the environment variables to my system as
OPENCV_VIDEOIO_DEBUG 1
OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_MSMF 0
Now anything else is to be added to the scripts using webcam

		I have same issue in ubuntu, and above solution (OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_MSMF=0) did not work for me. Is there any plan to fix this bug?
