&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Window position wrong restored&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The window position doesn't work well with multi-monitor use.
Created windows store their position and size in registry when closed. Restart your app and open a window with the same name. The window position and size is read from registry and applied. 
BUT this doesn't use the current desktop work area (virtual desktop size minus taskbar and gadgets). Instead there is a pixel width of 3000 hard coded. As a result a window moved on the right area of the right monitor appears at the left side on the left monitor.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
