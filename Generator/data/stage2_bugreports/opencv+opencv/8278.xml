	<summary>CV_XADD compile errors with Embarcadero C++ Builder 10.1</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.2
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Embarcadero C++ Builder 10.1, Clang-based bcc32c compiler

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In cvdef.h, the following line fails to compile for two reasons
#else
  CV_INLINE CV_XADD(int* addr, int delta) { int tmp = *addr; *addr += delta; return tmp; }
#endif
First is "[bcc32c Error] cvdef.h(442): C++ requires a type specifier for all declarations". Reason is the function has no return value, but it should return int.
Second is "[bcc32c Error] ptr.inl.hpp(67): no matching function for call to 'CV_XADD'"
"[bcc32c Hint] cvdef.h(442): candidate function not viable: no known conversion from 'unsigned int *' to 'int *' for 1st argument". The same error also occurs on line 72 in ptr.inl.hpp.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Add OpenCV include file

#include &lt;opencv2/core/core.hpp&gt;

Try to compile

		Could you try to add "int":

CV_INLINE int CV_XADD(...)"

But using this branch you will compile thread unsafe code. Why _MSC_VER detection doesn't work?(your system is Windows - are you use cross-compilation?)
Could you dump used compiler defines? It is something like clang -dM -E - &lt; /dev/null, but with OpenCV specific flags (see make VERBOSE=1 or similar output).
Also you can try to use CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and define your custom CV_XADD macro (be careful with spaces).
BTW, This platform is not supported officially. But we will accept reasonable patches, that don't break existed functionality.

		I can make this branch to compile by adding "int" as you suggested, and changing PtrOwner::refCount to int in ptr.inl.hpp. But this might be an imperfect fix. I don't know if there are other files that use CV_XADD with unsigned int.

		The command that should dump predefined macros does not seem to work this compiler. But the macros are listed in the documentation here: &lt;denchmark-link:http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Berlin/en/Predefined_Macros&gt;http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Berlin/en/Predefined_Macros&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Basically, the compiler defines __BORLANDC__ and __clang__, and does not define _MSC_VER.
C++ Builder 10.1. is "C++Builder Berlin".

		Well, Could you try to change this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.2.0/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/cvdef.h#L423&gt;line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
- #elif defined __GNUC__
+ #elif defined __GNUC__ || defined __clang__

		That change fixes the issue.
