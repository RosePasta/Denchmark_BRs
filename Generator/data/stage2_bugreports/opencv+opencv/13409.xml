	<summary>Potential bug in cv::medianBlur() for large images in OpenCV 4.0.0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 4.0.0 (maybe 3.4.x for x &gt; 0)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 10, 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2017

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We encountered a problem with the cv::medianBlur() function for large images while switching from OpenCV 3.4.0 to OpenCV 4.0.0 lately.
In OpenCV 3.4.0, cv::medianBlur() delivers reasonable results for small and large images.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692578/49787982-62a06c80-fd28-11e8-94c2-1c881fe79a33.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In OpenCV 4.0.0, cv::medianBlur() generates severe artifacts for large images.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692578/49788197-fc681980-fd28-11e8-876e-a3460dfda7e7.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692578/49788199-feca7380-fd28-11e8-8a6b-b6498dbb4a26.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Download this image
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692578/49787624-6f709080-fd27-11e8-8e27-9b34a9f6f8ec.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Run
cv::Mat img = cv::imread("img.png", cv::IMREAD_GRAYSCALE);
cv::Mat imgLarge;
cv::resize(img, imgLarge, cv::Size(2048, 2048));
cv::medianBlur(imgLarge, imgLarge, 9);
Inspect the result, e.g. using the Image Watch extension in Visual Studio or cv::imshow().
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Wild guess&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We had a brief look at the source code differences between the aforementioned OpenCV versions with respect to the cv::medianBlur() function. It seems, that there have been a lot of changes in the internal medianBlur_8u_O1() function, whereas the internal medianBlur_8u_Om() function seems to be untouched.
Therefore, we copied the internal medianBlur_8u_Om() implementation into our code and ran it directly.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692578/49788875-ccba1100-fd2a-11e8-9b14-9cb1c4c27ae6.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2692578/49788878-cdeb3e00-fd2a-11e8-86c6-92e91ad01413.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We assume, that the internal medianBlur_8u_Om() implementation is used for small images, hence the cv::medianBlur() function still works for these. So, finally, our wild guess is, that some errors might have been introduced into in the internal medianBlur_8u_O1() implementation during the recent modifications. Unfortunately, we don't have resources to further investigate this issue on our own, but hopefully, we could provide a clue into the right direction.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HansHirse&gt;@HansHirse&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
I ran the Python version of the snippet you provided and it appears that the issue is between the master and 3.4 branch.
Here is the result for :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12136202/50052700-56644700-014e-11e9-972e-259e65e9d6b3.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And here is the result for OpenCV-4.0 (master branch)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12136202/50052706-68de8080-014e-11e9-9270-1b8b742e2692.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I will try to figure out what's the issue as well.
Update
To me it appears that the one main difference in the median_blur.cpp file in both the branches is the following line:
CV_IPP_RUN_FAST(ipp_medianFilter(src0, dst, ksize));
In master branch, this line has been commented out whereas that's not the case in 3.4 branch.
The best way to test this hypothesis would be to recompile OpenCV-master with 3.4 version of median_blur.cpp (Something that I intend to do today). I will let you know in case of any update.
Meanwhile, I would also like to test one other case. A simple checkboard having black and white squares only. I want to make sure which of the two versions of median blur is correct.

		Try OpenCV 3.4.4 with cmake -DWITH_IPP=OFF .... Perhaps there is the same problem.

		I am gonna try it out today. Let's see.

First of all, sorry for the late reply. I am on a vacation ðŸ˜„
Anyways, coming back to the topic. The hypothesis turned out to be correct.
Here are the results.

As is clear, not just from the images but from their size as well, the commented out (CV_IPP_RUN_FAST(ipp_medianFilter(src0, dst, ksize));) seems to be the issue.
The question that arises is, what does this mean? Is OpenCV's core version of medianBlur incorrect and IPP's optimized version correct? If so, it should be possible to fix the WITH_IPP=OFF version of the code as well (or not?).
