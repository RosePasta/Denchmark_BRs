	<summary>OpenCV stomps existing Intel TBB thread names</summary>
	<description>
This is very minor but annoying and easy to reproduce: When compiled with Intel TBB, running any kind of OpenCV work will automatically call __itt_thread_set_name, overwriting any previously set thread name. When using OpenCV in an application that already sets its own thread names, this replaces the application's names with generic, much less informative "OpenCVThread-(xxx)" names.
Unfortunately, Intel's thread naming API doesn't seem to allow querying for the current thread name, so working around this isn't as simple as checking for an existing name and only setting it if there is none.
