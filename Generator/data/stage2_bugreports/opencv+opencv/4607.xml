&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;train_auto fails.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I'm attepting to execute train_auto on an SVM classifier with thousands of vectors, each having 10000 dimension, but the following error is thrown:

&lt;pre&gt;
OpenCV Error: Bad argument (While cross-validation one or more of the classes have been fell out of the sample. Try to enlarge &lt;CvSVMParams::k_fold&gt;) in CvSVM::do_train.
&lt;/pre&gt;


In order to test it with a small sample, I used the following code:

&lt;pre&gt;
Mat samples(4, 2, CV_32F);
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(0, 0) = 5;
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(0, 1) = 5;
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(1, 0) = -5;
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(1, 1) = 5;
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(2, 0) = -5;
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(2, 1) = -5;
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(3, 0) = 5;
samples.at&lt;float&gt;(3, 1) = -5;

Mat labels(4, 1, CV_32S);
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(0, 0) = 1;
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(1, 0) = 2;
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(2, 0) = 3;
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(3, 0) = 4;

CvSVMParams params;
params.svm_type    = SVM::C_SVC;
params.C           = 1;
params.kernel_type = SVM::RBF;
params.term_crit   = TermCriteria(CV_TERMCRIT_ITER, (int)1e7, 1e-6);

SVM svm;
svm.train_auto(samples, labels, Mat(), Mat(), params, 2);
&lt;/pre&gt;

And the same error is thrown. Note that I've been trying different values of the k_fold parameters in the original case. I have less than 100 classes and have tried less and more than 100, and it still fails.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hello M B,

thank you for reporting the issue!
You have done a lot of investigation, hence may be you'll have time to propose your own solution for this bug? That would be really great and appreciated! (please see http://www.code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute for details).

Thank you in advance,
Victor Kocheganov

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Unfortunately, I do not have knowledge of the underlying mathematical model, so I can't really help on this issue.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;is that really a bug ? 

looking at the labels, i see, that there's only one item per class.
train_auto does a k-fold crossvalidation, you specified k=2 there(the minimal value)
but how should that work with only 1 item per class ?

changing the labels like this:
@
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(0, 0) = 1;
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(1, 0) = 2;
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(2, 0) = 1;
labels.at&lt;int&gt;(3, 0) = 2;
@
lets the code run w/o errors.

again, i think, your data is faulty here, not the code. you need more than 1 item of the same class for train_auto
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;M B on 2013-08-06 13:45&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In this case k = 2 and k = 4 will work (with your modifications). k = 6, however, will still fail.

Let's say I have 60 classes, 59 of which have more than a 100 vectors, the remaning one has just one vector. Would it fail in the same way? Because the point is, it's failing for thousands of vectors which are classified in no ore than 60 classes, so I'm trying to figure out with a smaller case what the problem is.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
