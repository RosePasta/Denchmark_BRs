	<summary>JavaCameraView depecrated API</summary>
	<description>
I am currently using JavaCameraView to enable flash. Unfortunately the APIs of camera1 is deprecated.
Is there another class that use camera2 api?
I saw that there is javacamera2View but unfortunately it does not allow access to the camera.
Solutions?

With JavaCameraView I can access the Camera mCamera (because it is protected) field and set the flash. Now the problem is that the API for enable flash is depecrated (camera2 or camerax is the best now).
This is the method depecrated
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; public void setEffect(String effect) {
        mCamera.getParameters(); //deprecated
        Camera.Parameters params = mCamera.getParameters();
        params.setFlashMode(effect);
        mCamera.setParameters(params);
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In JavaCamera2 all fields are private and I have no way of accessing the camera in order to enable flash.
I need to use the opencv methods (onCameraFrame etc..) and a way for enable flash with the new API

all fields are private

I believe we can change some of them to "protected".
Feel free to propose PR for 3.4 branch.

I need this for enable flash
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;try {
    // Change some capture settings
    mPreviewRequestBuilder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE, CaptureRequest.CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON);
    // Build new request (we can't just edit existing one, as it is immutable)
    mPreviewRequest = mPreviewRequestBuilder.build();
    // Set new repeating request with our changed one
    mCaptureSession.setRepeatingRequest(mPreviewRequest, mCaptureCallback, mBackgroundHandler);
} catch (CameraAccessException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
