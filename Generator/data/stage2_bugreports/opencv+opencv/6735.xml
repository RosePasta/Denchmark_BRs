	<summary>OpenCVModules.cmake broken on Windows</summary>
	<description>
When trying to build one of my projects on Windows with git HEAD of OpenCV, I get the following error in CMake:

CMake Error at C:/Development/opencv-3.1.0/x64/vc12/lib/OpenCVModules.cmake:182 (message):
The imported target "opencv_core" references the file
"C:/Development/x64/vc12/lib/opencv_core310d.lib"

but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:


The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.


An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.


The installation package was faulty and contained
"C:/Development/opencv-3.1.0/x64/vc12/lib/OpenCVModules.cmake"
but not all the files it references.


Call Stack (most recent call first):
C:/Development/opencv-3.1.0/x64/vc12/lib/OpenCVConfig.cmake:92 (include)
C:/Development/opencv-3.1.0/OpenCVConfig.cmake:120 (include)
CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package)

This is using Visual Studio 2013 and CMake 3.5.1 (both for the project and for the OpenCV).
The issue appears to be in the ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/x64/vc12/lib/OpenCVModules.cmake, which contans the following block at line 41:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Compute the installation prefix relative to this file.
get_filename_component(_IMPORT_PREFIX "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE}" PATH)
get_filename_component(_IMPORT_PREFIX "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}" PATH)
get_filename_component(_IMPORT_PREFIX "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}" PATH)
get_filename_component(_IMPORT_PREFIX "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}" PATH)
get_filename_component(_IMPORT_PREFIX "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}" PATH)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

There is one get_filename_component() call too many, causing CMake to end outside of the actual installation directory, and hence failing to find the library files.
Bisection shows that this regression was introduced by the following commit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/f57e3ce5f3a77e541c25912dce4cf6d8ddff94b1&gt;f57e3ce&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Reverting it results in an OpenCVModules.cmake that contains one get_filename_component() less.
On a side note, the issue does not occur on linux, where the generated OpenCVModules.cmake contains correct number of get_filename_component() calls...
