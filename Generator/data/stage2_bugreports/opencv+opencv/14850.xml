	<summary>compiling from master cap_ffmpeg_api.hpp missing</summary>
	<description>
Hello.
I just got the latest code from master and tried to compile(i haven't compiled for maybe 1-2 months) and i get
/opt/opencv_contrib/modules/cudacodec/src/precomp.hpp:84:41: fatal error: ../src/cap_ffmpeg_api.hpp: No such file or directory compilation terminated. modules/cudacodec/CMakeFiles/opencv_cudacodec_pch_dephelp.dir/build.make:62: recipe for target 'modules/cudacodec/CMakeFiles/opencv_cudacodec_pch_dephelp.dir/opencv_cudacodec_pch_dephelp.cxx.o' failed make[2]: *** [modules/cudacodec/CMakeFiles/opencv_cudacodec_pch_dephelp.dir/opencv_cudacodec_pch_dephelp.cxx.o] Error 1 CMakeFiles/Makefile2:6081: recipe for target 'modules/cudacodec/CMakeFiles/opencv_cudacodec_pch_dephelp.dir/all' failed make[1]: *** [modules/cudacodec/CMakeFiles/opencv_cudacodec_pch_dephelp.dir/all] Error 2
I'm using cuda 10.1 and if i set DWITH_NVCUVID=OFF it works as expected , but i need nvcuvid.
I have installed Video_Codec_SDK_9.0.20 and i was compiling without any problems.
The thing is that cap_ffmpeg_api.hpp doesn't exist anymore.
Thanks!

		I am having a similar problem, I am trying to use OpenCV4.2 and I am getting this error:
[ 15%] Built target opencv_cudaarithm
Makefile:162: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
Does anyone has any idea how to fix this problem ? I tried different things but still I stuck in the installation of OpenCV on Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Thanks a lot,
Aldo
