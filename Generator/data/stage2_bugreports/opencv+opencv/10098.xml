	<summary>Possible bug for cv::FindHomography with custom MyAllocator : public cv::MatAllocator</summary>
	<description>
Hey
I created my own opencv  intel - Ippi based allocator, my allocator class inherent from cv::MatAllocator
and and uses ippiMalloc_8u(...) for every memory allocation.
My allocator allocate memory with stride, which means that the data is not continues, even though when I  create a 3x3 cv::Mat matrix .
The problem start when I use cv::findHomography function,  this function used to work excellent with the cv::Mat::DefaultAllocator.
However when I use ippi based allocator the function return an empty matrix (e.g for error).
I dive into opencv code -  calib3d\src\fundam.cpp, line 116,
cout = m1.checkVector()
cout  returns -1, (instead of 4 by  default allocator)
The question is why cv:::FindHomograpy  doesn't work with using my allocator ? Is that a possible bug?
I assumed opencv should work with any allocator given.
Thanks for your help

.
Could you provide reproducer via this constructor?

		I used custom allocator to solve my problem
Please close the thread,
Thanks
