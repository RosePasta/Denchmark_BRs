	<summary>imread crashes when loading large png 16-bit files larger than int size</summary>
	<description>
OpenCV crashes when loading large 16-bit png images (&gt; 2.4 GB uncompressed). There is probably bug in file grfmt_png.cpp on line 284:
for( y = 0; y &lt; m_height; y++ )
buffer[y] = data + y*step;
where step variable is int (y * step overflows). Easy fix should probably be not to cast step from size_t to int but use img.step directly:
for( y = 0; y &lt; m_height; y++ )
buffer[y] = data + y*img.step;

		hi, I am willing to investigate this bug, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jplanner&gt;@jplanner&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , could you please share me the large png file or share me the way to generate such kind of large png file? So that I can re-produce this bug.

		I can confirm this bug on Linux (Debian "Wheezy" 64-Bit) with OpenCV (either 2.4 or 3.1). The application crashes  when I load 16-bit  PGM images using the flag "CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE". "cv::imread" does not fail or give apparent problems. However, trying to clone the cv::Mat object or going out of the scope where the variable is declared causes a crash.  The crash doesn't happen when it is loaded without this flag.
I have attached the image for debug purposes.  The backtrace shows that the crash happened in libopencv_core.so.3.1.

		can you test the latest master of the 2.4 branch since the PR which should resolve this was merged there?

		<comment id='5' author='jplanner' date='2016-04-20T11:04:02Z'>
		Sure. I' ll compile it in my dev. environment and see if the issue persists.

		The error persists with the master version of OpenCV 2.4.
The test case which causes the crash is the following:
cv::Mat test_image =cv::imread("Scene_Persp0001.pgm",CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE);
cv::Mat image_copy = test_image.clone();

 , the root cause for issue reported by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RSaracchini&gt;@RSaracchini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is not the same with previous fix.
The root cause for this issue is: during calling imread to read the pgm file, when returning with success reading file, the destructor will free the resource which used by memcpy, but in the code, the resource calculation was not correct, therefore, it will cause memory corruption during resource free.
I will file a another bug for this issue because I believe the root cause is not the same with bug 6317. If so, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Dikay900&gt;@Dikay900&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , could we close fix 6317 here? Thanks!

 This waits for master fix. "Merge 2.4" process is in progress
