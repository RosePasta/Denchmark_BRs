&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.4.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit / Windows 32 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2017

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I switched to 3.4.1 from 3.3.0 and my code started failing with BOWKMeansTrainer on the same dataset that worked well in 3.4.1. Error - "OpenCV(3.4.1-dev) Error: Assertion failed (a &gt;= 0) in cv::divUp"
It comes from new code from revision &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/90aac764dd6e8c77265b1b5d616b0a70d4c74a42&gt;90aac76&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 when it tries to calculate divUp(dims * N * K, CV_KMEANS_PARALLEL_GRANULARITY) where in my case:
dims = 64
N = 28493
K = 2000
And it results in integer overflow (-647863296). Since all multipliers are ints, compiler also calls integer version of divUp.
Changing could to (size_t)(dims * N * K) fixes the issue.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Try to train some large BoW vocabulary.
