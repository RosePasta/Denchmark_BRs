&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Incorrect mouse coordinates using HighGUI? Possibly a bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;This seems to be a problem only when the image displayed is much bigger than the screen, so it may only be a minor problem. For example, if an image displayed at 100% in a namedWindow has width 3000 pixels and is much wider than the screen size, then OpenCV will open a window much smaller than this width. And the full width of the image will not be displayed in the namedWindow. However, setting up a callback, the x,y coordinates from CV_EVENT_MOUSEMOVE seem to be incorrect. Maybe the coordinates from the mouse event gets scaled even though the namedWindow's width is not the same as the image width.

Perhaps this HighGUI portion of OpenCV is already considered deprecated? I'm using version 2.4.3 on 32 bit Windows with Visual C++. Thanks.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This was active before OpenCV2.4.10 but was solved somewhere around that marker. Nevertheless the OpenCV highgui and mouse handling interface is used mainly for debugging and not for creating complete GUI interfaces. Keep that in mind.
This can be closed down.
