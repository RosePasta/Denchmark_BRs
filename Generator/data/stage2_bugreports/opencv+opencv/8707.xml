	<summary>OpenCV 3.2: Problems with The Aravis SDK Installation</summary>
	<description>
Hello Guys,
I've found an issue on the OpenCV 3.2 release, if we run the installation with the Aravis SDK, certainly a problem is going to appear. The following file, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/videoio/src/cap_aravis.cpp&gt;cap_aravis.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, on the line 393, has a problem, because it is subtracting two floats and using &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/abs/?kw=abs&gt;abs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 function. The correct approach is to use the &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/fabs/?kw=fabs&gt;fabs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 function, in the &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/?kw=math.h&gt;math.h&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 header, to subtract floats.
The currently code is the following:
 if(exposureAvailable) {
            if(abs(exposure - ne) &gt; 2) {
                // priority 2 - control of exposure time
                arv_camera_set_exposure_time(camera, (exposure = ne) );
                return;
            }
        }
The correct is:
 if(exposureAvailable) {
            if(fabs(exposure - ne) &gt; 2) {
                // priority 2 - control of exposure time
                arv_camera_set_exposure_time(camera, (exposure = ne) );
                return;
            }
        }

		I believe it is better to use &lt;denchmark-link:http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/fabs&gt;std::abs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (cmath include).

		You've got to pay attention to that, because the whole code uses &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/fabs/?kw=fabs&gt;fabs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in all other cases. There is more one possible problem, because the code might use some c++ functions and if we use &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/abs/&gt;std::abs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the namespace "std" has to be used, that may induce other problems. On the line 377 it's got the following code, using &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/fabs/?kw=fabs&gt;fabs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 function:
   // if change of value requires intervention
    if(fabs(d-dmid) &gt; 5) {
        double ev, ng = 0;

		Well, in general a typo.
I do agree with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 here.
As std library is already included for sake of code clarity it is better to use in both places std::abs as floating point version of abs() will not change algorithm behaviour (but will be seen by others as proper use).
I will then prepare  small correction to use consistently std::fabs() in this module.

		So, I fixed this problem on my system using the functions as I described above. The other solutions didn't work, I hope to help the users to fix that.

		By the way ensure that while using this code for automatic exposure calculation no other similar functionality is working.
It happened to me that I was fooled by one of recent TIS camera having automatic exposure functionality, turned on by default.
