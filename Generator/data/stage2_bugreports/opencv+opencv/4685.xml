&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;OpenCL SURF matching quality decreased&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;after https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/2014
Now it finds about twice less features with same params, and their matching is less reliable.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;This change was a set of performance optimizations I worked on.  We validated against the tests in OpenCV and some internal tests as well.  But of course we could have missed something.  If someone has a particular test case that shows the problem, I would be happy to look at it.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hello!

I've tried to reproduce the problem again and attach my performance tests, but unfortunately OpenCL SURF seems to be broken after T-API transition. "tapi/surf_matcher.cpp" sample works fine with '-m' switch, but crashes with 

&lt;pre&gt;
OpenCV Error: Assertion failed (clEnqueueReadBuffer(q, (cl_mem)u-&gt;handle, CL_TRUE, 0, u-&gt;size, 
alignedPtr.getAlignedPtr(), 0, 0, 0) == CL_SUCCESS) in cv::ocl::OpenCLAllocator::map, 
file ..\..\..\modules\core\src\ocl.cpp, line 3790
&lt;/pre&gt;

when using OpenCL.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Alexander, please look at this Intel-specific issue.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Alexander, sorry for late response. 
Unfortunately OpenCL implementation of SURF not available in master branch now, we found out that current implementation have errors.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I also have quality degradation on OpenCL implementation. Why not revert &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/2014&gt;#2014&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ? Also I have some problems, when calling detect and compute one by one (NaNs in descriptors), (in detectAndCompute no NaNs).
What kind of other errors new implementation have? If you list them - somebody or I may be could fix them.
