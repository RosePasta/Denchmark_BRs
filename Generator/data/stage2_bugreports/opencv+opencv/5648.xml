	<summary>VideoWriter generates vertically flipped video with the MSMF backend on Windows 7, 64bit</summary>
	<description>
The cv::VideoWriter() on Windows 7, 64bit, creates vertically flipped videos when using the Microsoft Media Foundation backend. We have used the H264 fourcc and mp4 container.
To verify that the problem is not in our code, we created the video also using the Video for Windows backend with the MSVC fourcc and avi container. The resulting video was not vertically flipped.

		Here is a patch that makes CvVideoWriter_MSMF::WriteFrame() copy the frames  in the correct order. The ARM case is unchanged, because we could not test it. But it has probably the same problem.
