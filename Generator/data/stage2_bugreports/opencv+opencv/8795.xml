	<summary>HOGDescriptor::computeGradient produces an access violation for some windowed inputs</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

OpenCV =&gt;  3.2
OS =&gt; Windows 64 bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2017
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

With 0 padding and other parameters that work for other images, HOGDescriptor::computeGradient will produce an access violation error on line 374 of hog.cpp
This is caused by the value at xmap[-1] being changed to 65533 in line 328 of hog.cpp, which then means that p00 is set to an invalid value. This doesn't happen immediately but halfway through the image.
I don't know why this happens for some inputs and not others, but either there's a bug to fix or an assertion that should be made that prevents us reaching this step.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

run the code below
#include "opencv2/core.hpp"
#include "opencv2/objdetect.hpp"
using namespace cv;
int main()
{
   Mat test= Mat::zeros(576,704,CV_8UC3);
   Rect r(68,380,112,192);
   HOGDescriptor hog;
   std::vector&lt;float&gt; desc;
   hog.compute(test(r), desc, Size(8,8), Size(0,0)); //it throws during the execution of this line
   return 0;
}

 do you have the bug when SSE is turned off?
