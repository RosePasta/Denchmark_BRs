	<summary>CUDA ARCH BIN 5.0 FAILURE</summary>
	<description>
Dear All,
The bin is incompatible with graphic card version 5.0.
General problem :
The problem is in CUDA_ARCH_BIN because no support 5.0 version and only proposed 3.0 3.5 version for Kepler generation, and PTX don't create.
The program don't function in CUDA but is function in openCL.
Because the graphic card don't accept the cubin different of 5.0
The problem is worse with Auto detect generation because the program don't compile and the error is : nvcc : architecture is not compatible.
Description problem:
In set Kepler config.
I modify in CMake 5.0 in CUDA_ARCH_BIN and after config the value in CUDA_ARCH_BIN is automatically reset to 3.0 3.5 and the PTX is reset in never.
For forced CMake I have modify  CMakeCache.txt in the build folder
I test this :
//Specify 'real' GPU architectures to build binaries for, BIN(PTX)
// format is supported
CUDA_ARCH_BIN:STRING=3.0 3.5 5.0
//Specify 'virtual' PTX architectures to build PTX intermediate
// code for
CUDA_ARCH_PTX:STRING=
//Attach the build rule to the CUDA source file.  Enable only when
// the CUDA source file is added to at most one target.
CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE:BOOL=ON
//Generate and parse .cubin files in Device mode.
CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN:BOOL=OFF
The result is same
After I test this :
//Specify 'real' GPU architectures to build binaries for, BIN(PTX)
// format is supported
CUDA_ARCH_BIN:STRING=3.0 3.5 5.0
//Specify 'virtual' PTX architectures to build PTX intermediate
// code for
CUDA_ARCH_PTX:STRING= 5.0
//Attach the build rule to the CUDA source file.  Enable only when
// the CUDA source file is added to at most one target.
CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE:BOOL=ON
//Generate and parse .cubin files in Device mode.
CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN:BOOL=ON
The result is same
I resolve the problem with no-compliance method but the program good run
I modify in OpenCVDetectCUDA.cmake in the source/cmake folder
This is my modification :
set(__cuda_arch_ptx "")
if(CUDA_GENERATION STREQUAL "Fermi")
set(__cuda_arch_bin "2.0 2.1(2.0)")
elseif(CUDA_GENERATION STREQUAL "Kepler")
if(${CUDA_VERSION} VERSION_LESS "5.0")
set(__cuda_arch_bin "3.0")
else()
set(__cuda_arch_bin "3.0 3.5 5.0")
endif()
elseif(CUDA_GENERATION STREQUAL "Auto")
execute_process( COMMAND "${CUDA_NVCC_EXECUTABLE}" "${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/checks/OpenCVDetectCudaArch.cu" "--run"
My software config :
Cuda toolkit v7.0
OpenCV v2.4.10
CMake v3.2.0
My hardware config :
GPU name: NVIDIA Quadro K2200
GPU version: 5.0
GPU multiProc: 5
I expect my message help you for a correct modification.
If please let us know if you need anything else.
best regards

		You can manually specify the CUDA_ARCH_BIN option in CMake command line:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cmake -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=5.0 &lt;path to opencv&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thank you for your reply and take time for the answer to my problem.
I apologize for my late response.
I run the command line and the result is there:

Detected CUDA 7.0
CUDA NVCC targets flags: -gencode ; arch = compute_30 , code = sm_30 ; -gencode ; arch = com
pute_35 , code = sm_35

It the same result as my amendment to the CMakeCache.txt
failure is CMakeCache.txt :
// Format is supported
CUDA_ARCH_BIN : String = 3.0 3.5
I expect my message help you for a correct modification.
If please let us know if you need anything else.
best regards

		Did you set CUDA_GENERATION? Try to unset it:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cmake -DCUDA_GENERATION="" -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN=5.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thank you for your reply more quickly
And for more accuracy
It seems that the line:
set(__cuda_arch_bin "3.0 3.5")
in cmake/OpenCVDetectCUDA.cmake sets CUDA_ARCH_BIN back to "3.0 3.5"
whatever we specifiy with -DARCH_CUDA_BIN
It solved the problem temporarily by modifying this line to:
set(__cuda_arch_bin "3.0 3.5 5.0")
And I try your operation tomorrow
Thank you

		Thank you for the support and the time pass
In efect, I try Keppler and Auto in  CUDA_GENERATION= and I had the problem in my first post .
And the problem is solved with this jet47 with the last Post :
-DCUDA_GENERATION cmake = "" = 5.0 -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN
