&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1 (master, ecb8fb9)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; ubuntu 16.04 LTS server 64-bit
Compiler =&gt; GCC 5.4

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

During build I have the following error:
[ 40%] Building CXX object modules/videoio/CMakeFiles/opencv_videoio.dir/src/cap_ffmpeg.cpp.o
make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/../lib/libavcodec.a', needed by 'lib/libopencv_videoio.so.3.1.0'.  Stop.
All ffmpeg-related stuff is installed, I see in cmake output:
--     FFMPEG:                      YES
--       codec:                     YES (ver Unknown)
--       format:                    YES (ver Unknown)
--       util:                      YES (ver Unknown)
--       swscale:                   YES (ver Unknown)
--       resample:                  YES (ver Unknown)
--       gentoo-style:              YES
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone http://github.com/opencv/opencv
cd opencv
mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Actually the problem appears just because pkg-config is missed in described system and I see no any warning in cmake output, but build can't be done correctly. Not sure that issue should be fixed, and not sure where I can post this info. Possibly pkg-config should be in dependencies?

		Ensure, you have all the dependencies resolved.
&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html&gt;http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Probably you need to install libavcodec-dev.
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev

		Have you read it carefully? I mentioned that ALL dependencies are installed (please look at cmake output: YES for all ffmpeg-related stuff). The only problem is in cmake checks: without pkg-config it checks only headers presence in system, not libraries. It leads to errors, because during build it tries to find libraries in some guessed ffmpeg root (i. e. in 
/../lib), but in linux it's wrong path: libraries are in /usr/lib or in /usr/lib/*-linux-gnu). If we have pkg-config installed, it resolves paths correctly, but without it we don't have any error during cmake, but actually have incorrectly configured paths to ffmpeg libs.

 if I remember it correct the installation guides clearly state you need  as dependencies, which in turn contains a fully working  manager. So I agree that all dependencies should be fulfilled as stated by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DiaLight&gt;@DiaLight&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Probably you missed that small dependency somewhere ...

 I already know why it doesn't work, and problem is solved. I just wanted to point out that without pkg-config there is no any error during cmake stage (everything is OK, everything is found), but actually opencv can't be built correctly. And build error is not so obvious. My suggestion is either fix ffmpeg-related cmake script to provide also libraries lookup (I can make PR if needed), or provide pkg-config dependency check in cmake stage, or just close this issue. It is not critical at all.

 this was very useful I hit exactly the same issue, the problem is  on 16.04 server seems to not include  binary any more ...

 Go ahead and make a PR ;)

		You can take a look on approach from PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/7743&gt;#7743&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 into 2.4 branch (It will be ported into master soon)

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/StevenPuttemans&gt;@StevenPuttemans&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I verified the approach for fixing this but I can't make a PR because I don't have environment to test the PR build so if someone else can make this work then it would be so good

 like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just said, the fix is in and will be ported into master soon.
