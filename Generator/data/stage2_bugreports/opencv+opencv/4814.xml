&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;OpenCV3 intermodule dependencies aren't all checked during makefile generation&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I'm on Windows x64 using CMake 3.0 to generate a VS2010x64 project for OpenCV 3.0 (22223939b0ab).

I use the CMake GUI on Windows, and if I uncheck everything but the 'ml' and 'python3' modules, I can successfully generate a VS2010 project. Compiling this project, however, fails. Turns out that the Python3 project ignores whatever modules you've checked, so I've needed to add 'core', 'flann', 'features2d', along with features2d's dependencies: imgproc, imgcodecs, video, and highgui. Feature2d's dependencies are checked during CMake generation, so it warns you about it not being included, but nothing else has checks. This made it quite confusing for me as a first-time user.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Roman, could you check this?
Thanks.
