&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Mat::reshape is called incorrectly in EM::setTrainData&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I am using openCV 2.4.9, compiled on a Win 7 64-bit box.

When using EM (em.cpp) with the option of starting with the E-step, one provides the initial means, covariance matrices, and weights. The variable weights is a number of clusters by 1 matrix/vector. In em.cpp, in the function EM::setTrainData, the variable weights is "reshaped" to a 1 x number of clusters vector using the function call 

weights.reshape(1, 1)

Unfortunately, when the input is a number of clusters X 1 vector, this reshape does nothing, resulting in a bad initial weight vector (because subsequently the initial weights are computed based on the number of columns).

I also tested the Mat::reshape function independently, and I confirmed that the function call does nothing for a N X 1 vector/matrix.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;since reshape() *returns* a new Mat header (it does not work inplace), it seems, that there's an assignment missing:

    weights = weights.reshape(1,1);

(without it, the reshape operation just gets ignored)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;be rak, thanks for nice catch!

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;@S Yoon , do you have some test code for the EM ? 

i'm having a bit of trouble reproducing it.

seems, if i want to test the EM::START_E_STEP flag, i need to supply valid weights,means and covs, what did you use there ?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
