&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Temporary files are not deleted for the case of tiff in imdecode. There seem to be more people having this issue as it was asked here as well: &lt;denchmark-link:http://answers.opencv.org/question/98206/temp-files-are-not-deleted/&gt;http://answers.opencv.org/question/98206/temp-files-are-not-deleted/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Technical description:
The TiffDecoder keeps an open file handle. As a consequence the file cannot be removed before the TiffDecoder closes the file.
I will create a pull request with a fix proposal.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cv::Mat img = ...
std::vector&lt;uchar&gt; buf;
cv::imencode(".tiff", img, buf);
cv::imdecode(buf, IMREAD_UNCHANGED); // this creates a temporary file and does not delete it
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
