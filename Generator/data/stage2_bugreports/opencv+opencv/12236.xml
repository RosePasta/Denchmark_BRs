	<summary>TrainData incorrectly split datasets where (rows == cols)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.4
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2017

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I understand that this is rare case, but it happened to me. My train data had number of samples (rows) equal to the number of features (cols). Attempt to retrieve samples from TrainData causes crash in TrainData::getSubVector(). It was trying to work with my data like they were ordered COL_SAMPLE.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cv::Mat test = cv::Mat::zeros(15, 15, CV_32FC1);
cv::Mat labels = cv::Mat::zeros(15, 1, CV_32SC1);
cv::Ptr&lt;cv::ml::TrainData&gt; train_data = cv::ml::TrainData::create(test, cv::ml::ROW_SAMPLE, labels);
train_data-&gt;setTrainTestSplitRatio(0.9);
train_data-&gt;getTestResponses();
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thanks, it makes better sense to me, however I haven't tried it on my data yet. Is there any easy way to get this revision without forking your personal repository? Or I can just wait until it will be merged in opencv.

		No need to fork repositories, just grab commits from pull request. Like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git fetch https://github.com/opencv/opencv +pull/12242/head:pr12242
git checkout pr12242
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Sorry for delay. I confirm that problem is fixed with real data, where it was originally reproduced.
