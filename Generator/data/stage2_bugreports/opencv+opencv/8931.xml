	<summary>OpenCV 3 simple VideoCapture and waitKey crashes after a while on Mac</summary>
	<description>
OpenCV 3.1.0 is installed through brew install opencv3 --with-contirb --with-qt5 and the following program crashes after a while:
#include &lt;opencv2/core.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2/highgui.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2/videoio.hpp&gt;

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    cv::VideoCapture cap(0);
    cv::Mat frame;
    while (cap.read(frame)) {
        imshow("Frame", frame);
        if (cv::waitKey(1) == 'q') {
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
While &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5874&gt;#5874&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 appeared to fix this at first, subsequent testing has shown this bug is still actively occurring. I've created this new, open issue to increase visibility of the problem.

		Version 3.1 is quite outdated, could you please check if the problem persists in 3.2.0 or latest master?

 what version of OpenCV are you on? They recently said the problem exists at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5874#issuecomment-314916044&gt;#5874 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I still have this issue with OpenCV 3.4.0, C++, Mac OS 10.12.6.  I am running the video capture loop in a separate thread (using pthread).  Installed with brew.
Immediately throws the following exception.  Looks like the 'nextEventMatchingMask' needs to be attached to the main thread.  This issue goes away when I remove the waitKey(0), but I need the viewer window.  Can someone confirm this is the same issue?

from the Main Thread

That is. This is the limitation of UI threads on Mac OS and many others platforms.

I couldn't reproduce the issue on the latest release.

Closing this.

 can you clarify your explanation + closing? Others continue to be able to reproduce this problem in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5874&gt;#5874&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 after that one was closed.
Could you at least post a fix to the code if this is a known issue for which the code must be written differently?

		You &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/8931#issuecomment-317672933&gt;state&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that you don't see this problem on the latest release - so there is nothing to fix on 3.x(master) branch anymore. For exact commit number feel free to run "git bisect" process.

 comment is not related to original issue at all (UI interaction from non-main thread is prohibited by platform - this is known limitation and would not be fixed) and this comment will be removed from this thread.
