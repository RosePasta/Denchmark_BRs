	<summary>Allow negative values for setTrackbarMin</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.3
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu 16.04 (x86-64) with QT 5
Compiler =&gt; g++ 5.4.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 currently ignores negative parameters, making it impossible to set a negative minimum for a trackbar when using QT. The latter's  which OpenCV relies on does not seem to have such a restriction (or, if so, it is also undocumented, cf. &lt;denchmark-link:http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractslider.html#minimum-prop&gt;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractslider.html#minimum-prop&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). If OpenCV keeps this restriction ( needs to be positive) for compatibility (or other reasons), it should be mentioned in the documentation.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is currently no code path for the opposite case of



opencv/modules/highgui/src/window_QT.cpp

: Since you labeled this a feature, is there a reason why the positivity check is in the code in the first place? From a quick look, the GTK backend, for example, just passes the minimum value (positive or negative) through without checking.

		I have no answer on "why" question. But I don't see any real reasons to just ignore passed negative values.
Regarding GTK backend - I have updated it several days ago ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/9369&gt;#9369&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) and saw similar issue. GTK, for example, works fine with negative values too.

		Sorry for the misunderstanding. My question was: why is this categorized as a feature and not as a bug? Currently, the QT backend silently ignores negative values, unlike, e.g., the GTK backend.

		Sorry for my misunderstanding. I mean "feature" here - "support negative values". Also it can be classified as a "bug" ("stop silently ignore negative values").

		Similarly, why is setTrackbarMax ignoring negative values?
What if the range of some algorithm's parameter is between -2 to -1? In this case it would seem natural to set the trackbar min to -2 and the trackbar max to -1.
Looking at the QtSlider documentation, it looks like Qt is smart enough to adjust the range if min &gt; max, and that window_QT.cpp shouldn't have to worry about checking if min &lt; max in either setTrackbarMin or setTrackbarMax.
A possible solution is to just remove the 2  checks in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/highgui/src/window_QT.cpp&gt;window_QT.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/highgui/src/window_QT.cpp#L676&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/highgui/src/window_QT.cpp#L691&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, does this sound sane to you? If yes, I can submit a PR.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dustsigns&gt;@dustsigns&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, would you be interested in trying out a PR that contains such a fix?

Please give &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/9498&gt;#9498&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 a try if the build test passes. Let us know if it works out.
It would be of interest to know what Qt does when max &lt; min and whether behaviour is satisfactory.

		Hi, I have one question.
I also want to use negative value in the trackbar in win32.
Unlike QSlider, the win32 trackbar becomes disabled when min&gt; max.
Therefore, I guessed the user's intention and swapped the values when min&gt; max.
Is there any problem in this case?
