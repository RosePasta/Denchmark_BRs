&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; master (specifically c48807c and later)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu 14.04 Jetson TK1 (Arm 32bit)
Compiler =&gt; CUDA 6.5 and GCC 4.8.4

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV master build fails on Jetson TK1

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- -----------------------------------------------------------------
--
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
CUDA_nppial_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
    linked by target "opencv_cudev" in directory /home/ubuntu/opencv-fork/modules/cudev
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


I pasted entire log here
The point is that nppi has been split to many libraries
I'm not sure from when this happened, but probably not from CUDA 5.0
I'll write a PR for this later, probably adding another if section in the cmake file
I'm just not sure from when nppi has been separated

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


build OpenCV master (c48807c or later) on Jetson TK1
