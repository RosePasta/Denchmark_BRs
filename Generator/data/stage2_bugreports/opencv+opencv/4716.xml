&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;cmake policy warnings CMP0026 and CMP0038&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;when running cmake I get these cmake warnings. I guess they do no harm but better change them. I put the output of cmake in attachment.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hi, Chris! Looks like it's an CMake's issue. Please try it with 2.8.x CMake version.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Hi!

This is because CMake v. 2.x and 3.x based on different standards that's why some features usually used in 2.x branch are not allowed (valid etc) in 3.x and you will get errors (warnings) on cmake-configuration step. You can try to use the script in attachment before.
