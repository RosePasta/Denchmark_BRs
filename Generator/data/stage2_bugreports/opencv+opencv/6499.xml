	<summary>OpenCV Q&amp;A website has been down for 4 days in a row</summary>
	<description>
Hi guys,
Since Alexander Shishkov (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alekcac&gt;@alekcac&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) is not responding on the designated issue page of the Q&amp;A website, I am trying to get a hold of one of the core devs that could explain or tell us why the Q&amp;A has been down for 4 days? Any problems we can help out with?
Cheers,
Steven

		Hi Steven,
I am in vacation now and I was offline last week. We have some issues with current hosting. In my opinion one of HDDs in our server has hardware issue. We are trying to find the reason of such behavior with hosting support. We will try to fix issues with website as soon as possible.
