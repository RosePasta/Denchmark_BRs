	<summary>OpenCV 2.4 with FFMPEG 3.0.</summary>
	<description>
I'm one of the maintainers of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science&gt;Homebrew/Science&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We're getting reports that OpenCV 2.4 doesn't build with FFMPEG 3.0. The error is as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5762&gt;#5762&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Looking at what you've done in OpenCV3, I prepared &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dpo/c459b13eec0dc38d87a6&gt;this patch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I'm no expert on either OpenCV or FFMPEG. Does the patch look complete to you? If so, feel free to merge it in for future releases.
Thanks.

		I'm still facing the issue. I've done brew update and brew uninstall ffmpeg. then tried brew install opencv --with-ffmpeg. still same error!

 , the fix has not been released yet. You have to build OpenCV by yourself using latest 2.4 branch revision or wait for OpenCV 2.4.13 and corresponding brew update.
AFAIK, brew has  option which allows you to install latest version from repository.
