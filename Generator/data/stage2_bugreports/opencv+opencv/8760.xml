	<summary>findChessboardCorners flags naming</summary>
	<description>

OpenCV =&gt; 3.2.0
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Linux Mint 18.1 x64
Compiler =&gt; gcc 5.4.0
Python =&gt; 3.5.2

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Regarding following document:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga93efa9b0aa890de240ca32b11253dd4a&gt;http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga93efa9b0aa890de240ca32b11253dd4a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

several constantthat related with findChessboardCorners "flags" argument, have to be presented in OpenCV Python buinding:
CV_CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH
CV_CALIB_CB_NORMALIZE_IMAGE
CV_CALIB_CB_FILTER_QUADS
Actually, following constants are defined:
CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH
CALIB_CB_NORMALIZE_IMAGE
CALIB_CB_FILTER_QUADS
Looks like documentation issue.
Nevertheless, code analysis of the OpenCV shown, that CV_CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH is defined in:
modules/calib3d/include/opencv2/calib3d/calib3d_c.h
and CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH is defined in:
modules/calib3d/include/opencv2/calib3d.hpp
It seems like different constant naming for C and C++ OpenCV buinding.
But CV_CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH is still used in following C++ file:
modules/calib3d/test/test_chesscorners_badarg.cpp

 , the fix for  branch has been merged (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/8761&gt;#8761&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), you can port it to  branch.
