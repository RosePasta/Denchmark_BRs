	<summary>cudaarithm: inplace version of NPP flip fails with odd number ROI</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; recent 3.4 (8cb7eae) / master (3b00ee2)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Jetson Nano/TX1/TX2/XavierNX
Compiler =&gt; GCC 5.4.0, GCC 7.5.0
CUDA =&gt; 10.0 (Nano) 10.2 (XavierNX) 8.0 (TX1,TX2)

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This issue was originally found by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nglee&gt;@nglee&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The in-place version of mirror was enabled in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/17863&gt;#17863&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Unfortunately, the test intermittently fails.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./opencv_test_cudaarithm

 4 FAILED TESTS
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I was able to reproduce it separate from OpenCV, so the cause came from NPP
I contacted with NPP team, and I got reply that

There was a synchronization issue in in-place version
The NPP team chose not to fix this, but instead, in the future release, this in-place function will explicitly return an error value NPP_SIZE_ERROR when width and/or height is odd number
I think I need to add the same limit in the cv::cuda::flip

I'll send a patch shortly
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

run ./opencv_test_cudaarithm
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Issue submission checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I report the issue, it's not a question


 I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues,
answers.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution


 I updated to latest OpenCV version and the issue is still there


 There is reproducer code and related data files: videos, images, onnx, etc
