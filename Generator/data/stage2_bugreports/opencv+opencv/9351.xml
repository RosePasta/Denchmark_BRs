		Was just about to post this same Issue. Fixed by prepending cv:: to Range in a couple of places. How was this not caught by continuous integration?

 , first you have to reproduce the issue. I guess it can be done by &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html&gt;compiling OpenCV&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with  cmake option.

		Sorry but I have a silly Question due to which I am having trouble in contributing to opencv.
I have the code cloned in my laptop, now if I want to start contributing then I should know that if there is something wrong in the code, that I get to know from GitHub issues, but how do I check it, I mean how and where should I run the opencv code? can you briefly explain my the workflow cycle from selecting an issue to working on it to testing on it then to PR.
