	<summary>Color blob sample crashes</summary>
	<description>
Hey guys
The color blob detection sample app crashes on my device with the SIGNET error and nothing else on the log file. All the other OpenCV samples work perfectly so I dont know what the error might be. I know it occurs in the line
mDetector.process(mRgba); .
PS - I even tried the apk but it crashes there too
Any ideas ?

		Can you attach more detailed information: device model and architecture, Android version, OpenCV version, logcat output?

		I encountered the same problem. It seems that app crashes on call  multiply_5(src1.nativeObj, src2.val[0], src2.val[1], src2.val[2], src2.val[3], dst.nativeObj); in Core.multiply().
Log: A/libc: Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 1, fault addr 0x0 in tid 670 (Thread-74833)
I tested in with OpenCV version 3.3.1 on Samsung A3 Android API 23.

		I ran into the same issue (with OpenCV 3.4.1 and 3.4.3) and I could fix it by manual install the opencv manager (&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35843940/opencv-3-1-0-absdiff-does-not-work/39833284#39833284&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		Has anyone reproduced this issue recently ? I suspect it has been fixed in the meantime
