	<summary>hdr header</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; :3.4
Operating System / Platform =&gt; :Windows 64 Bit / python
Compiler =&gt; :(python 3.6)

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

OpenCV writes a hdr file with header starting with "#?RGBE". But many programs suppose "#?RADIANCE" and don't work on files with "#?RGBE".  Would you change this header line to "#?RADIANCE"?

		It may be just as simple as changing the string const  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgcodecs/src/rgbe.cpp#L148&gt;rbge.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's write header routine from  to .
I don't know this format well, but it looks like programtype is not determine write data routine for this format.
From what I've read, the hdr format should be specifying RADIANCE instead. The rgbe.cpp file is just a carry over file from a looong time ago that probably used RGBE when the supplier of rgbe.cpp made it.

 Please see PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16188&gt;#16188&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Other projects have made this change and this should help. I haven't tested it within OpenCV. Any chance you'd be able to try it out and see if the image reader you use reads hdr files with this change as a sanity test?
