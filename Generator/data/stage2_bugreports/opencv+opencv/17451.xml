	<description>
I think that should be useful add in the documentation of the function cornerSubPix() the references to:
Wolfgang Förstner and Eberhard Gülch. A fast operator for detection and precise location of distinct points, corners and centres of circular features. In Proc. ISPRS intercommission conference on fast processing of photogrammetric data, pages 281–305, 1987.
