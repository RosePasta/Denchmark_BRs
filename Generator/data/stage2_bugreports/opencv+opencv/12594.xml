	<summary>Incorrect iterator in KeyPointsFilter::retainBest</summary>
	<description>
OpenCV =&gt; Source code on master
In modules/features2d/src/keypoint.cpp, function KeyPointsFilter::retainBest at line 80:
 std::nth_element(keypoints.begin(), keypoints.begin() + n_points, keypoints.end(), ...
This will rearrange the list such that the first n_points + 1 elements are greater than or equal to the subsequent points, ie keypoints[0] through keypoints[n_points]. However, the ambiguous response is taken from element n_points - 1 and there is no guarantee of ordering within this region, so it may actually be quite different from the true ambiguous value at keypoints[n_points].
When called on keypoint vectors that are identical but for ordering (as may happen when switching feature detector implementation from CPU to GPU), the results of retainBest may vary.
This only potentially affects the lowest valued keypoints that would otherwise be retained so probably not a big deal performance-wise, but it does manifest when testing different implementations of keypoint generators that return their values in different orders.

		Could you please provide some minimal reproducer with expected/actual results?

Here is a reproducer. Includes a version of retainBest with a proposed fix.
