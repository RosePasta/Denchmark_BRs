	<summary>Some bugs result to crashes when calling imread of opencv (include heap overflow and out of bound write)</summary>
	<description>
Some crashes are found in opencv when a malformed image file read by calling  "cv::imread" function.
Opencv 3.3 and the latest commit are tested, but it seems that the bugs also impacts Opencv 2.x .
The bugs which result to "segment fault" are including heap overflow and out-of-bound write, which may be potential security threat.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.3
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Linux
