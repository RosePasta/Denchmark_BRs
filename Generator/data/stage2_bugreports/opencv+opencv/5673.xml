	<summary>Python samples not correct</summary>
	<description>
Some of my students noticed that the python tutorials are incorrect and no longer working. For example the backgroundsubtraction sample &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/ref/master/db/d5c/tutorial_py_bg_subtraction.html#gsc.tab=0&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has an error in line
fgbg = cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()
which should actually be
fgbg = cv2.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()
I am wondering if this is the case for all functionality and thus, all samples need to be adapted? If so I am able to provide fixes, but I would rather love to have a more experienced python user to confirm this problem.

 could you confirm?

		yes, true, both MOG and GMG are in bgsegm now.
it probably also needs a hint that both of them were moved to opencv_contrib
(MOG2 and KNN are the ones remaining in main/trunk, the latter should be documented, too, but i'm not at all familiar with it)
c++ version &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Itseez/opencv/master/doc/tutorials/video/background_subtraction/background_subtraction.markdown&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  too (L 72)

		Ok thanks for the feedback! And regarding the cv2.submodule.function, is this also the case for the main repo?
		</comment>
		<comment id='4' author='StevenPuttemans' date='2015-11-17T12:00:24Z'>
		cv2.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()
cv2.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorGMG()
cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()
cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorKNN()
did you mean that ?

		<comment id='5' author='StevenPuttemans' date='2015-11-17T12:04:59Z'>
		Well for the contributed modules the systems goes as follows
fgbg = cv2.bgsegm.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG()
but for the normal repository, is it then
fgbg = cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()
or
fgbg = cv2.video.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()?
		</comment>
		<comment id='6' author='StevenPuttemans' date='2015-11-17T12:07:37Z'>
		no,
cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2()
cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorKNN()
(without .video submodule, there's no such thing)

		<comment id='7' author='StevenPuttemans' date='2015-11-17T12:10:28Z'>
		Do correct me, but that is weird right, that normal modules don't have submodules and contrib modules do?
		</comment>
		<comment id='8' author='StevenPuttemans' date='2015-11-17T12:12:04Z'>
		well, oh ;)
i guess, it would even break abi compatibility, if one would introduce them now.

		why am I getting this error?

 , this is not a bug, your cv2 probably does not contain this module
you have to build your cv2 from src with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib&gt;opencv_contrib&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Got it.

		Are there any pre-built packages that include the contrib modules? Or building them from source is the only way?
		</comment>
		<comment id='14' author='StevenPuttemans' date='2018-06-03T21:51:40Z'>
		There are no any official packages with contrib from OpenCV team. But they exist via pip, anaconda, etc.

		That should work:
pip install opencv-contrib-python

That should work:
pip install opencv-contrib-python

There is a risk with this! If your opencv-python and opencv-contrib-python are out of sync (different versions) than there is about 95% chance it will blow up in your face and your software won't work. In that case I think it is always better to ensure you built the correct version combination yourself.

		Is this issue still open. I would like to look into this if there's anything I can contribute!

		Since this issue is quite old, from 2015, chances of someone not providing a fix already are very small. Have a look at the current python samples and go discover for yourself: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html&gt;https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Fixed on &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.opencv.org/ref/master/d8/d38/tutorial_bgsegm_bg_subtraction.html&gt;master&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 branch.
