&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;opencv 2.4.11 imgcodecs not found&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;While installing caffe I am getting error- Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
Whose solution seems to be by adding opencv_imgcodecs in Makefile libraries. But when I do that I get an error- could not find library lopencv_imgcodecs.
Is it so that imgcodecs is available only on opencv 3.0 version?

Mac OS 10.9, x86_64, Anaconda, cuda 6.5
When I tried to install opencv using-
brew install --devel opencv   I got foll error- 
DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7
-DWITH_CUDA=OFF

CMake Error: The source directory "/tmp/opencv20150412-88139-lbnq9o/opencv-3.0.0-beta/macbuild/DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7" does not exist
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Can you please not bump topics if you have no extra information? Many of us do this on a free basis, when we got spare time, so be patient...

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;to your question the stated library is indeed only available in 3.0.
Using 2.4 you probably have to include opencv_highgui.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I agree with this.

It seems to be some local system configuration problems, please, feel free to reopen if you get more information.
