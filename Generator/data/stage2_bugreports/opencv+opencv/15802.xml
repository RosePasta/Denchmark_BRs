	<summary>Enabling CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION causes CMake configuration crash</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; master
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When doing Configure on master branch in Windows with CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION checked, it causes the CMake configuration process to fail on errors like these:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVUtils.cmake:331 (target_include_directories):
  Cannot specify include directories for target "opencv_test_core_SSE4_1"
  which is not built by this project.

.....
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and many more of the same error for the various components that are selected for building.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In Windows 10 x64, CMake (v3.7.2), clone the repo, checkout master branch, and run CMake Configure with Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64 as the compiler.

 I used the CMake GUI. I hit Configure, then when it returns the list of build parameters, I enable CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION and hit Generate (or Configure). Below is the output.

Seems to be something checking about pthreads? Doesn't make sense in Win platforms?
I don't know enough of CMake for Windows to sense what's wrong here.

		Could you try this fix &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/15835&gt;#15835&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (clean build directory first)?

I didn't look in details, but MinGW can emulate pthreads API.
Failed checks in CMake are NOT errors.

One thing to note, in that branch, invoking Generate (with or without CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION) causes this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Configuring done
CMake Error: install(EXPORT "OpenCVModules" ...) includes target "opencv_hal" which requires target "ippiw" that is not in any export set.
CMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
  export called with target "opencv_hal" which requires target "ippiw" that
  is not in any export set.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So I believe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/15835&gt;#15835&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 likely resolves the CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION issue, but worth noting the above error happens on Generate in that branch.
