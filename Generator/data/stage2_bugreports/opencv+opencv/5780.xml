	<summary>`cv::cuda::createContinuous`effectively ignores its `cols` argument</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/1db4afac6aa52be3e158a5fdc03572ee0d51baf1&gt;1db4afa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  was made generic and it now uses  instead of setting  and  directly. But  only takes a  parameter, and calculates an appropriate number of . This means that the result of  may have a different number of columns than requested.
This breaks, for example, the repeated use of a single cv::cuda::Convolution instance on images of varying sizes, because the persistent buffers don't get resized correctly.
A quick fix would be to change the area check in createContinuousImpl from obj.size().area() &lt; area to obj.size().area() != area, but that would of course introduce more reallocations than strictly necessary.
