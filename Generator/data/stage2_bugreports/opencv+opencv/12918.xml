	<summary>dnn/samples: null pointer in findFile()</summary>
	<description>

OpenCV =&gt; master (3 days old), but same problem in 3.4
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; mingw64 7.2.0

the code here:



opencv/samples/dnn/common.hpp


        Lines 61 to 62
      in
      dbed39a






 std::string extraPaths[] = {getenv("OPENCV_DNN_TEST_DATA_PATH"), 



 getenv("OPENCV_TEST_DATA_PATH")}; 





assumes, that both environment vars are set, else we assign a null (char*) pointer from getenv() to a string, resulting in
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
    what():  basic_string::_M_construct null not valid
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

it should also be documented, what is expected here. do we really have to run the download_models.py from extra now ? (i made a "dry" run, it tries to dl total 8576.365888595581 MB)
