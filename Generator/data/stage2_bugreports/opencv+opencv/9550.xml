	<summary>Incorrect handling of 16 bit tiff images with photometric interpretation 0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.3
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2013

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

cv::imread seems to handle 16 bit grayvalue tif images incorrectly when photometric interpretation is 0 ("WhiteIsZero"). The resulting cv::Mat has type CV_8UC1. When the photometric interpretation is 1, however, the image is loaded correctly as CV_16UC1.
I suspect the error to be in the condition starting from line 154 in modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_tiff.cpp, where photometric==0 leads to setting bpp to 8.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Test images were created using ImageJ using File-&gt;New-&gt;Image... with 16-bit. One image was inverted using Image-&gt;Color-&gt;Edit LUT...-&gt;Invert,,.
tiffdump showed the photometric interpretation to be the only tag being different in the two images.
Images were loaded using the following code:
cv::Mat image = cv::imread("16bit.tif", cv::IMREAD_UNCHANGED);
cv::Mat image_inv = cv::imread("16bit_inv.tif", cv::IMREAD_UNCHANGED);

std::cout &lt;&lt; image.type() &lt;&lt; std::endl;			// prints '2'
std::cout &lt;&lt; image_inv.type() &lt;&lt; std::endl;		// prints '0'

		I  the problematic line is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_tiff.cpp#L237&gt;237&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in .
It's not considering the case where  is , which would explain why &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/drtdt&gt;@drtdt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is getting a  matrix as the type for TIFFs which have .
I think replacing the check, photometric != 2 &amp;&amp; photometric != 1, with photometric &gt; 2 will allow the OP to read 16bpp TIFFs which have PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION = 0 into a CV_16U matrix.
I'll wait for comments from others on whether this is a suitable fix. I can have a tested PR for this upon approval.

  the fix seems to be correct, so your PR (with regression test) is welcome.

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/9564&gt;#9564&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should resolve the issue.

 Upon further thought, I think a regression test just for this would be unnecessary. I think this aspect is very unlikely to regress in the future. If there is disagreement, I can add a test.
