	<summary>Reference to non-existent parameter name in documentation of StereoSGBM::create</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.3
Operating System / Platform =&gt; -
Compiler =&gt; -

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The documentation for &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/d2/d85/classcv_1_1StereoSGBM.html#adb7a50ef5f200ad9559e9b0e976cfa59&gt;StereoSGBM::create&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentions  which is not a parameter of the constructor:

See stereo_match.cpp sample where some reasonably good P1 and P2 values are shown (like 8*number_of_image_channels*SADWindowSize*SADWindowSize and 32*number_of_image_channels*SADWindowSize*SADWindowSize , respectively).

I suppose that is due to the fact that the parameter  was called  in OpenCV 2.4.0 (cf. &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/2.4.0/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#stereosgbm-stereosgbm&gt;http://docs.opencv.org/2.4.0/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#stereosgbm-stereosgbm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Maybe the documentation in the current version should be updated to avoid confusion. This seems to have been introduced with OpenCV 3.0.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Replace SADWindowSize with blocksize in the documentation of StereoSGBM::create.

 Not too familiar with this area, but just taking a quick look, does 's SADWindowSize deserve to be renamed to blockSize if it's related to ?

		It seems so, but maybe someone more experienced with the use of this function should be the judge of that.

		replacing SADWindowSize with blocksize or replacing blocksize with SADWindowSize
maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=SADWindowSize&amp;type=&gt;looking places where SADWindowSize used&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will help to understand better.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 what it your suggestion to fix this?

		Lets do this:

replacing SADWindowSize with blocksize blockSize

in public headers only:

modules/calib3d/include
