	<summary>OpenCV 3.0 build fails on Ubuntu 12.04</summary>
	<description>
I used the official 3.0 release (&lt;denchmark-link:http://opencv.org/downloads.html&gt;http://opencv.org/downloads.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and ran into this during a build on Ubuntu 12.04:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;...
[ 16%] Building CXX object modules/videoio/CMakeFiles/opencv_videoio.dir/src/cap_ffmpeg.cpp.o
In file included from /home/uli/opencv/opencv-3.0.0/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg.cpp:45:0:
/home/uli/opencv/opencv-3.0.0/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp:1546:71: error: use of enum ‚ÄòAVCodecID‚Äô without previous declaration
/home/uli/opencv/opencv-3.0.0/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp:1556:83: error: use of enum ‚ÄòAVCodecID‚Äô without previous declaration
make[2]: *** [modules/videoio/CMakeFiles/opencv_videoio.dir/src/cap_ffmpeg.cpp.o] Error 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I took a quick look at the code, and the reason for the build error seems a bug in cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp.  Early in the file, CV_CODEC_ID gets defined to be AVCodecID or CodecID depending on FFmpeg version:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#if LIBAVCODEC_BUILD &gt;= CALC_FFMPEG_VERSION(54,25,0)
#  define CV_CODEC_ID AVCodecID 
#  define CV_CODEC(name) AV_##name
#else
#  define CV_CODEC_ID CodecID
#  define CV_CODEC(name) name
#endif
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But on lines 1546 and 1556 (errors above),  is used instead of .  Fixing this made my build work.  I posted this solution on &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/31818445/1628638&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, where someone else ran into the issue.  The same issue is also reported at least twice on &lt;denchmark-link:http://answers.opencv.org&gt;http://answers.opencv.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 actually I just checked, it is already fixed! No need to supply it again.
rule 1546: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp#L1546&gt;https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp#L1546&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This can be closed down.

		Sorry for that; I had done some searches for this bug in the issue tracker, but should have also checked the master branch...  But learned how to do pull requests in the process.  :)
