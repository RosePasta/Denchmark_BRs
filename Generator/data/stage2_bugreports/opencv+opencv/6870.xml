	<summary>cv::RNG::fill overwrites variables in stack</summary>
	<description>
I tried saving the variables into a xml file, but the saved value has been different from a memory. I felt strange and examined, cv::RNG::fill may overwrite the variables in stack region.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Please state the information for your system&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV version: 2.4.9 and 2.4.13, I checked
Host OS: Linux (Ubuntu 14.04)
Target OS: host / Linux 3.13.0-86-generic x86_64
Compiler &amp; CMake: GCC 4.8.4 &amp; CMake 2.8.12.2

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which part of the OpenCV library you got the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


core

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

All of variables before calling cv::RNG::fill are equal to after. E.g., the following code prints:
(a, b, c, d) = (10, 0.5, -1.3, 104)
(a, b, c, d) = (10, 0.5, -1.3, 104)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Some of variables before calling cv::RNG::fill were different from after. E.g., the following code printed:
(a, b, c, d) = (10, 0.5, -1.3, 104)
(a, b, c, d) = (-9, -9, -1.3, 104)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Additional description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Not overwritten when non-double type&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I haven't get the same behavior when I changed the type of 'x' to the other type (e.g. cv::Mat_, cv::Mat_cv::Vec2i, cv::Mat_cv::Point3f, etc.).
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;The number of channels may affect the behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have made sure the number of variables in stack has been overwritten.
When the type of 'x' was cv::Mat_, no stack variables was overwritten.
When the type of 'x' was cv::Mat_cv::Vec2d or cv::Mat_cv::Point2d, only 'a' was overwritten.
When the type of 'x' was cv::Mat_cv::Vec3d or cv::Mat_cv::Point3d, 'a' and 'b' were overwritten.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Only double-type variables in stack are overwritten&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I changed the type of 'a' from double to float in the following code, and then 'a' was not overwritten but 'b' was overwritten.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;cv::RNG::fill overwrites variables in stack as the value of 'mean'&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Overwritten variables in stack had the value of 'mean', which was the 3rd argument of cv::RNG::fill.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;cv::RNG::fill performs expected behavior when generates uniform distribution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

cv::RNG::fill overwrites no variables in stack when I specify cv::RNG::UNIFORM to the 2nd argument of cv::RNG::fill.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Code example to reproduce the issue / Steps to reproduce the issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2/core.hpp&gt;

int main() {
    double a = 10;
    double b = 0.5;
    cv::Mat_&lt;cv::Point2d&gt; x(2, 3);
    double c = -1.3;
    double d = 104;

    std::cerr &lt;&lt; "(a, b, c, d) = " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; d &lt;&lt; ")" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    cv::theRNG().fill(x, cv::RNG::NORMAL, -9, 10);
    std::cerr &lt;&lt; "(a, b, c, d) = " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; d &lt;&lt; ")" &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I confirm this bug also in v3.1.0

		The problem is that RNG::fill() doesn't check that distribution parameters have the same number of channels as matrix to be filled.
PR will be created soon.
