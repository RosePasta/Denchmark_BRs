	<summary>opencv/cmake/OpenCVDetectOpenCL.cmake - alternative OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to compile OpenCV using AMDAPPSDK-3.0 for OpenCL part, but it was failing all the time on providing cmake with OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR.
In opencv/cmake/OpenCVDetectOpenCL.cmake lines 7-11
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;else(APPLE)
  set(OPENCL_FOUND YES)
  set(HAVE_OPENCL_STATIC OFF)
  set(OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR "${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR}/3rdparty/include/opencl/1.2")
endif(APPLE)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

override variable OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR so it is not possible to set a different include dir than the one provided by the package. So the line 23
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CMAKE_FLAGS "-DINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES:STRING=${OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR}"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After commenting the line
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;set(OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIR "${OpenCV_SOURCE_DIR}/3rdparty/include/opencl/1.2")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

everything went fine.

		There is "WITH_OPENCL" option that enables/disables this automatic detection. So you can try this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cmake -DWITH_OPENCL=OFF -DHAVE_OPENCL=ON =DHAVE_OPENCL_STATIC=ON -DOPENCL_LIBRARIES=... -DOPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS=... 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I did not think about using WITH_OPENCL=OFF and HAVE_OPENCL=ON, it is not that intuitive but clever.
I do not know if it is an issue but in your solution include path is not listed in the summary:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;--   OpenCL:
--     Version:                     dynamic
--     Include path:
--     libraries:                   /opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0/lib/x86_64/libOpenCL.so
--     Use AMDFFT:                  YES
--     Use AMDBLAS:                 YES
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

with my solution all CL* include dirs get listed
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;--   OpenCL:
--     Version:                     dynamic
--     Include path:                /opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0/include /opt/cfFFT/include /opt/clBLAS/include
--     libraries:                   /opt/AMDAPPSDK-3.0/lib/x86_64/libOpenCL.so
--     Use AMDFFT:                  YES
--     Use AMDBLAS:                 YES
-- 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
