	<summary>Tensorflow FIFOQueueV2 unknown layer type error</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2015

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm using the tf_importer.cpp to import a tensorflow pb frozen model. However, I get an error during populating to the Net class variable:
batch/fifo_queue:FIFOQueueV2
container:[ ]
component_types:[ ]
shapes:[ ]
capacity:[ ]
shared_name:[ ]
OpenCV Error: Unspecified error (Unknown layer type FIFOQueueV2 in op batch/fifo_queue) in cv::dnn::experimental_dnn_v1::`anonymous-namespace'::TFImporter::populateNet, file ......\source\modules\dnn\src\tensorflow\tf_importer.cpp, line 735
Is there a way I can add this layer type into tf_importer.cpp? Or how could I remove this as this is not used in the network any longer after training.
thanks

, could you try to apply a one more procedure over the frozen model? See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/optimize_for_inference.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/optimize_for_inference.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

, thanks for your suggestion, I'll give it a try in a minute. However, I can already see the next Layer being a problem and that is RestoreV2. Have you got any tips for that?

		It'll be much easier to say if you share this model with us. Is it possible? Please upload your .pb somewhere.

, sure, this is the link to the model:

 , model seems to me a kind of strange. I've tried to load it by
with tf.gfile.FastGFile('frozen_model.pb') as f:
    graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())
    for node in graph_def.node:
        print node.op
and output is only
Const
Const
Const
Const
RestoreV2
Assign
In example, the same code for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/dnn/tf_inception.cpp&gt;Inception-5h model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 produces Const, Conv2D, Relu, MaxPool etc. Could you please check the model?

, i was just trying to save on downloading a large file. this is the full model:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3yxfi3uSufjVzRjOUhaNVdxT2c/view?usp=sharing&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3yxfi3uSufjVzRjOUhaNVdxT2c/view?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and this is the graph:

, I've tried to apply &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/optimize_for_inference.py&gt;optimize_for_inference.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as mentioned above:
./bazel-bin/tensorflow/python/tools/optimize_for_inference \
  --input ~/Downloads/frozen_model_full.pb \
  --output ~/Downloads/frozen_model_full_opt.pb \
  --frozen_graph=True \
  --input_names="batch" \
  --output_names="fake_discriminator/discriminator/layer_5/Sigmoid,real_discriminator/discriminator/layer_5/Sigmoid"
Could you try to freeze model in single image mode (batch size == 1)? It seems to me that it will help easily drop the first few operations are used for batching.

, I've asked you to freeze the model with batch size 1 and share it with me because I can't load the old one even in TensorFlow.

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dkurt&gt;@dkurt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the frozen_model_full.pb is frozen with a batch size of 1 already and I imported it in tensorflow without any problem. But here you can find the original model so you can dig into it. &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3yxfi3uSufjaHhkNFNnYWR4bG8/view?usp=sharing&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3yxfi3uSufjaHhkNFNnYWR4bG8/view?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 , I tried to do something with this model. Truly, there are several operations that should be considered at  like element wise summation (Add), absolute value activation layer (Abs), scale by constant value (Mul), one more variation of padding operation (Pad), batch normalization (is it?). And it requires just few lines of code. But the thing is this model is so complicated for testing. I faced problems like

There are two inputs and two outputs. It's hard to say they are independent or not now.
Even after applying freeze_graph + optimize_for_inference tools there are operations like Mean for batch norm, StopGradient and a lot of others like SquaredDifference, Rsqrt, Square, Reciprocal, etc. Please, could you get a reference to an article or some source to this model? Based just on operation types it doesn't looks like common deep learning pipeline.

I would like to solve the problem with missing operations on some public models now. After that I'll continue with this one.

		TensorFlow parser will be extended at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/9287&gt;#9287&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
It seems to me, your model use batch normalization. It represents as sequence of atomic operations between constants (summation, multiplication, squared root), but it's just a scale and shift finally ().
Would it be OK with you if you save graph using ? Please don't forget to share it with us. Thanks!
