&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.2
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Linux 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; gcc

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Compiling the latest source with BUILD_TESTS enabled produces the testing binaries. Running CUDA related tests have no output.
./opencv_test_cudaarithm
CTEST_FULL_OUTPUT
OpenCV version: 3.2.0-dev
OpenCV VCS version: 3.2.0-29-gec5038f-dirty
Build type: release
CPU features: mmx sse sse2 sse3

Available options besides google test option: 
Usage: opencv_test_cudaarithm [params] 

	--cuda_device (value:-1)
		CUDA device on which tests will be executed (-1 means all devices)
	-h, --help (value:false)
		Print help info

[  PASSED  ] 0 tests.
Other tests do work, such as opencv_test_core. If I checkout the OpenCV 3.1.0 branch the CUDA related tests work again. Perhaps something went wrong with the gtest upgrade from 1.7 to 1.8 ?

		More details are required:

CMake stdout (from clean build) with information about CUDA settings
files from build folder: CMakeCache.txt and CMakeVars.txt (as attachment or use "grep" for CUDA keyword)
