	<summary>Building Python support on a Linux user account named `hal` always fails</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV version: 3.1
Host OS: Linux (Ubuntu 14.04)
Python: System Python or Anaconda distribution, fails either way.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which part of the OpenCV library?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Building from source w/ Python support

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When building from source from a user account named , building Python 2 or 3 support always fails (the rest of the build works fine). Importing headers fails; the list of headers is empty and io.open attempts to open an empty filename . The error originates from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/python/src2/hdr_parser.py#L746&gt;hdr_parser.py line 746&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 although I believe this is a symptom of a larger problem parsing user account names / home directory.
I tried a ton of different build configurations and wiped my Ubuntu partition and started from scratch twice, to no avail.
The most recent time I wiped my partition, I named my user account something other than hal. This fixed it.
