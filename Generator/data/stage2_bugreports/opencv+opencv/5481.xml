	<summary>Repeated/useless assignment in contours.cpp</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I am going through some of the source code as a learning exercise, and I noticed that in
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/contours.cpp&gt;https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/contours.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

in the method
cvStartFindContours
scanner-&gt; is assigned twice:
line 219: scanner-&gt;mode = mode;
line 225: scanner-&gt;mode = (int) mode;

		Also in this case, the one on line 225 can go, because mode is already defined as an integer so we do not need explicit conversion...

		Don't you think we can mark it as closed as PR is merged?
