Having just answered a series of questions on Stack Overflow (&lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31628505&gt;1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

) it seems there are a couple of bugs in the documentation of this tutorial.
It appears that any time drawMatches() or drawMatchesKnn() is called, outImg is required, although it can be passed as None.  In the documentation, it is sometimes omitted, causing a TypeError
The code also contains a line orb = cv2.ORB() that I think should be orb = cv2.create_ORB().  That is what worked on my install.  With the original - I see an AttributeError
Finally, I think the matplotlib import should be import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, rather than from matplotlib import pyplot as plt.
I'm not a regular opencv user, so wasn't confident enough in this to submit a pull request, but if someone more experienced can confirm then I'm happy to do that.

		The correct way to declare ORB is orb = cv2.create_ORB() instead of orb = cv2.create_ORB()

 not really sure what you mnean, but that is exactly how the PR fixes the tutorial. Btw there is no difference in both declarations you provided.
