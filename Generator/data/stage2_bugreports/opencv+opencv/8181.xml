	<summary>The implementation of cv::Mat::diag(int) does not match its comments</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1.0
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2015

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The implementation of cv::Mat cv::Mat::diag(int d = 0) const does not match its comments.
Its comments are listed below:
/** @brief Extracts a diagonal from a matrix

The method makes a new header for the specified matrix diagonal. The new matrix is represented as a
single-column matrix. Similarly to Mat::row and Mat::col, this is an O(1) operation.
@param d index of the diagonal, with the following values:
- `d=0` is the main diagonal.
- `d&gt;0` is a diagonal from the lower half. For example, d=1 means the diagonal is set
    immediately below the main one.
- `d&lt;0` is a diagonal from the upper half. For example, d=-1 means the diagonal is set
    immediately above the main one.
    */
Mat diag(int d=0) const;
According to the above comments, when d = 1,  the diagonal of the following matrix
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

should be
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;4
8
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But the actual output is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2
6
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following code can reproduce the result mentioned above:
cv::Mat m = (cv::Mat_&lt;int&gt;(3, 3) &lt;&lt; 
			1, 2, 3, 
			4, 5, 6, 
			7, 8, 9);

std::cout &lt;&lt; m.diag(1) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
