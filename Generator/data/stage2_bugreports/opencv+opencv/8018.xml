		This user had the same problem 6 years ago, is it still applicable?

 &lt;-- a couple of hack-arounds here.

		Could someone try this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/8736/commits/bdd9b244723300f5186a30f28e9288c7692a0fca&gt;patch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ? It resolves memory corruption problem in flann library for some Apple compilers.

		I'm also getting hit by this bug: runtime error upon executing Stitcher::Status s = stitcher.estimateTransform(images);.
The error only occurs in debug build. Release build works okay.
Was it just that modules/flann/include/opencv2/flann/any.h operator to add?   I inserted the code &amp; rebuilt but it didn't change anything.
I noticed that patch is part of a larger commit (18 files modified). Should I be downloading and applying the whole commit? (can't see how to do this).

 Thank you for check! Other changes are not related to flann library.

		How does one go about debugging an iOS build? I can imagine setting up the project in Xcode copying across all the linker flags etc from opencv/platforms/ios/build_framework.py but that looks like a backbreaker.

		For my particular situation, replacing:
#import &lt;opencv2/opencv.hpp&gt;
... with:
#import &lt;opencv2/stitching.hpp&gt;
#import &lt;opencv2/imgcodecs/ios.h&gt; // UIImageToMat
... did the trick.
Hope this helps narrow it down for someone.

		in my case replacing #include &lt;opencv2/opencv.hpp&gt;
with #include &lt;opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp&gt;  worked.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alex0-0&gt;@alex0-0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Here's a total hack that has gotten me past the  cvflann::anyimpl::bad_any_cast exception.  I suspect it will prove to be problematic down the road, but I'd be curious if anyone can comment on how feasible it is.
In Pods-&gt;OpenCV2-&gt;opencv_modules.hpp, on line 17, change:
#define HAVE_OPENCV_FLANN
to
#undef HAVE_OPENCV_FLANN

		Any idea now? I met this problem on ios 12.0 with opencv 3.4.4.

		My issue was solved starting the Flann as
flann::Index lsh_index(Mat(), flann::LshIndexParams(20,15,2));

		I had similar problem: Fixed it by replacing general import to specific ones.
But it didn't work for the first time, and then I realised I had 'PrefixHeader.pch' file which had include &lt;opencv2/opencv.hpp&gt;.
I commented the line and it resolved problem with crash

thanks.
