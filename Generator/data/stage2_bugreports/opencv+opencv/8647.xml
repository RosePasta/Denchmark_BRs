	<summary>Update matchTemplate documentation</summary>
	<description>
OpenCV 3.1
matchTemplate has a mask parameter. However, this mask parameter is only implemented for the CV_TM_SQDIFF and CV_TM_CCORR_NORMED methods. It would be nice if that was indicated in the docs.

		Looking at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/templmatch.cpp#L1087&gt;templmatch.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it does appear that only  and  are supported in case a template mask is supplied. A not implemented exception is thrown in case another method that is neither of those two is supplied.
Doc makes no mention of this.
