	<summary>Error executing samples and app (with Qt and OpenGL)</summary>
	<description>
Opencv - 3.3.0-rc-111-g12ed7ca63, Windows 7 x64, VS 2013. Also tested earlier on Windows XP and VS2010.
If Opencv builded with Qt and OpenGL while executing examples and app (opencv_annotation...) was received errors like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The procedure entry point
getProcAddress@QOpenGLContext@@QEBAP6AXXZPEBD@Z
could not be located in the dynamic link library Qt5Gui.dII.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This errors appeared only in release build.
Its relatively old bug and it pass approximately after 3.1.0-1276-gf6208e3de.

		Probably this is Qt5 related. There is &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.bountysource.com/issues/45623837-vlqt5_example-entry-point-not-found&gt;report&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of similar issue without OpenCV.

		Qt version (5.5) was not changed. Only opencv..
In a few hours I'll try to reproduce this in the old version Opencv

		Refinement. This bug related only to x64 release build. Qt dll usually “seeable” by environment path entry – in this case bug reproduced. But if Qt dll’s (Qt5Core.dll, QtGui5.dll..) was copied to folder which consist ruined exe file sample or app executing was correct.

		In current version opencv and Qt this bug resolved.
