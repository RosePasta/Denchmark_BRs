	<summary>Add support for color space conversion in CvCaptureCAM_VFW::retrieveFrame</summary>
	<description>
I recently tried using OpenCV on my Surface 4 computer to capture frames from the on-board front/rear cameras and it always fails in . From looking at other issues with Windows 8.1-10 I see similar issues (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5569&gt;#5569&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) which I think may be the same or a similar problem.
I added debug code to print vfmt0.biCompression and it shows that the camera driver is returning frames in the NV12 color space, but conversion from this space to RGB isn't currently supported by the library. I'm trying to add support using the cvtColor function, passing the COLOR_YUV2RGB_NV12 code but I haven't had any luck yet. I'm wondering if anyone here with more experience has any suggestions or could help with adding support.
