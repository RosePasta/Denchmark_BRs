	<summary>A typo in the get_duration_sec method is possible</summary>
	<description>

OpenCV =&gt; master

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A typo in the get_duration_sec method is possible - two times the same condition is written.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.3.1/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp#L1103&gt;https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.3.1/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp#L1103&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  double CvCapture_FFMPEG::get_duration_sec() const
{
    double sec = (double)ic-&gt;duration / (double)AV_TIME_BASE;

   if (sec &lt; eps_zero)  
    {
        sec = (double)ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;duration * r2d(ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;time_base);
    }

    if (sec &lt; eps_zero) // repeat?
    {
        sec = (double)ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;duration * r2d(ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;time_base);
    } 

    return sec;
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 ,@Landgraf132 I'm a newbie, and I would like to get the assignment of this issue. I'll just remove the extra set of if statement, that's all there is to this issue, right?
Also as I see it, this particular change in code doesn't change any functionality. But if in some other case my addition did affect some functionality, how would I check if the whole thing is working properly?
Regards.

 I think the extra set of if statement supposed to return the product of AVStream::duration, AVCodecContext::time_base
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sec = (double)ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;duration * r2d(ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;codec-&gt;time_base);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 on line 1136 there is a similar point, I hope this helps

 But why has it been repeated? Does it not return the product in the first instance itself?
@Landgraf132  the one on line 1136 doesn't seem to be a repetition, there's a difference between line 1139 and 1145. Are you talking about something else?

, I think Landgraf132 is talking about following a piece of code
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if (fps &lt; eps_zero)
{
    fps = r2d(ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;avg_frame_rate);
}

if (fps &lt; eps_zero)
{
    fps = 1.0 / r2d(ic-&gt;streams[video_stream]-&gt;codec-&gt;time_base);
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 thanks. they are both calculating fps but with different methods, so we can remove one.
Also I asked this above but no one answered so i'll ask it again: this particular change in code doesn't change any functionality. But if in some other case my addition did affect some functionality, how would I check if the whole thing is working properly?

 In my opinion, the mistake is that the second repetition was forgotten to change. It is necessary to find a file that will not contain a time_base in the stream, but it will contain in the codec.

		There is no forgotten change in  (at least this change is not needed at all for last 7 years).
Lets just remove the second duplicated code block: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blame/3.3.1/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp#L1111-L1115&gt;https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blame/3.3.1/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp#L1111-L1115&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
