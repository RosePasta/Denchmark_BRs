	<summary>Documentation of  imshow is not clear about how 64-bit floats are handled.</summary>
	<description>
While the documentation of &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html#ga453d42fe4cb60e5723281a89973ee563&gt;imshow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is quite clear about what happens with majority of OpenCV datatypes, it omits 64-bit floating point values.
Looking at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgcodecs/src/utils.cpp#L622&gt;source&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of the conversion function, it's apparent that the behaviour is identical to 32-bit floats.
Therefore I suggest the documentation to be updated to reflect this.
