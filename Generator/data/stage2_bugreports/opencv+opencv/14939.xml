	<summary>Building with MinGW on windows - failing on chmod</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I am trying to build OpenCV with MinGW on windows. The cmake configures as expected, but the make fails on libopencv_core_pch_dephelp.a with an error pointing to chmod?! As I understand it there is no chmod in windows. I am wondering if it is a bug in the cmake build or in the MinGW compiler. Can someone please clarify? Attached is a screen dump of the error.

		I fixed it by not using chmod in WIN32.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/15433&gt;#15433&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
