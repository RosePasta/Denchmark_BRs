&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Compilation (installation) error of opencv at WIndows&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Sourse in github: https://github.com/itseez/opencv 
CMake: 3.0 
GCC: gcc (i686-posix-dwarf-rev2, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 4.9.0

I compiled OpenCV. I got an error:

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steven Puttemans on 2014-07-31 12:26&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Did you have a previous VS system configured? I have read something about VC and Mingw screwing each others installations, and this seems exactly that.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Maxime Th√©bault on 2014-08-20 17:13&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I'm having the same issue (cmake 2.8.12.2, Mingw 4.9.1 i686-posix-dwarf-rev0).

I think I've never had Visual Studio installed on that computer.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Florian Simond on 2014-08-24 17:19&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I'm having the same problem.
I have never had VS installed on my computer neither, moreover I can compile OpenCV 2.4.9 without any problem...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;lorenzoo lorenzoo on 2014-09-05 08:47&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hi all,

exactly the same here 

Windows7 64 bit and VS installed

By the way I can compile opencv 2.4.9 without problem
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Ryein Goddard on 2014-09-11 21:41&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I have the same issue using mingw as well.  I found that for some reason IPP was turn on by default when using Cmake 3.0 GUI.  I just disabled it and everything compiled fine.

I have AMD CPU &amp; GPU so not sure why IPP was turned on.  IPP is Intel only right?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Florian Simond on 2014-09-12 06:11&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Yes the problem seems to come with IPP.

Here is some line of OpenCVFindIPP.cmake:
&lt;pre&gt;
if(WIN32 AND MINGW AND NOT IPP_VERSION_MAJOR LESS 7)
    # Since IPP built with Microsoft compiler and /GS option
    # ======================================================
    # From Windows SDK 7.1
    #   (usually in "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib"),
    # to avoid undefined reference to __security_cookie and _chkstk:
    set(MSV_RUNTMCHK "RunTmChk")
    set(IPP_LIBRARIES ${IPP_LIBRARIES} ${MSV_RUNTMCHK}${IPP_LIB_SUFFIX})

    # To avoid undefined reference to _alldiv and _chkstk
    # ===================================================
    # NB: it may require a recompilation of w32api (after having modified
    #     the file ntdll.def) to export the required functions
    #     See http://code.opencv.org/issues/1906 for additional details
    set(MSV_NTDLL    "ntdll")
    set(IPP_LIBRARIES ${IPP_LIBRARIES} ${MSV_NTDLL}${IPP_LIB_SUFFIX})
endif()
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm not a professional of CMake, but from what I understand it requires some resources of MSVC.... Am I correct ?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Michele Adduci on 2014-11-04 13:59&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WITH_IPP=OFF, I can compile OpenCV 3.0 with MSVC 2012 without any problem, using OpenNI2 support and OpenGL too.

-   % Done changed from 0 to 100
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Maksim Shabunin on 2015-04-28 14:34&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-   Target version changed from 3.0 to 3.1
-   Priority changed from Normal to Low
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Still an issue on mingw 64bit on windows 8 with intel i7 4720HQ

		I met the same issues with mingw, do we have a solution now? Do we have a target date of opencv3.1? thanks

 You can try to use  CMake parameter.

		"Fixed" in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/5282&gt;#5282&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 by disabling IPP by default for mingw builds. It can still be enabled b providing  option to cmake.

		That is not really a fix. You just disabled the IPP for mingw. When do you support this for mingw?
Is that really a problem of mingw or are there just missing references to be solved without visual studio ?
I like to use that for a performance critical application, so I'm really interested in a usable solution.
thanks
