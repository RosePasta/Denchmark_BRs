	<summary>FlannBasedMatcher is not in java wrappers?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; OSX 10.11.5 (15F34)
Compiler =&gt; Xcode Version 8.0 (8A218a)

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

FlannBasedMatcher is excluded from features2d java wrappers - why? It seems to be more consistent to have it in features2d package since BFMatcher is there.
I checked the wrapper generator code (gen_java.py) and it seems that FlannBasedMatcher was added to exceptions. What was the reason? Can we put it back?
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
