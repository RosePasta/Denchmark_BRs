	<summary>OpenCV doesn't seem to like bitonal files</summary>
	<description>
Can you please help me understand why I can't get imread to open simple bitonal files like this one?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://app.box.com/s/y2h71ydjb7uim1um1gwqjvsuqz2cpmf2&gt;https://app.box.com/s/y2h71ydjb7uim1um1gwqjvsuqz2cpmf2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is an example of what I get. It worked in 3.0 rc but with 3.0.0 it no longer works.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Could you add the line of code? Also did you check latest master branch?

		I used the fast_hough_transform.cpp distributed in the opencv_contrib folder as a test jig.  So this is the first few lines out of the function that loads the image.
static bool parseArgs(int argc, const char **argv,
    Mat &amp;img,
    int &amp;houghDepth,
    int &amp;houghAngleRange,
    int &amp;houghOperator,
    int &amp;houghSkew)
{
    if (argc &gt; 6)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Too many arguments" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return false;
    }

    const char *filename = argc &gt;= 2 ? argv[1]
        : "../../../samples/data/building.jpg";
    img = imread(filename, 0);
    if (img.empty())
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Failed to load image from '" &lt;&lt; filename &lt;&lt; "'" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return false;
    }
I have not tried the latest branch yet.  I only tried opencv 3.0rc and 3.0.0. I just did a git pull and I'm getting my dependencies in order now to compile opencv. I'll report back when I get the latest branch compiled.

		I've compiled the latest branch in x64 and it still fails.  I couldn't compile opencv_world so I just compiled the individual libraries to link against them.
This is the error.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Unhandled exception at 0x00007FF8349BE98D (opencv_imgcodecs300d.dll) in OpenCv_FastHough.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the code breaks into the UNROLL8 line of tif_getimage.c.
/*
 * 1-bit bilevel =&gt; colormap/RGB
 */
DECLAREContigPutFunc(put1bitbwtile)
{
    uint32** BWmap = img-&gt;BWmap;

    (void) x; (void) y;
    fromskew /= 8;
    while (h-- &gt; 0) {
    uint32* bw;
    UNROLL8(w, bw = BWmap[*pp++], *cp++ = *bw++);
    cp += toskew;
    pp += fromskew;
    }
}
Also, for what it's worth, UNROLL8 fails in the while loop when h = 1.

		Fix from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/5357&gt;#5357&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should be ported to master branch

		I can confirm that these changes fix my problem with the bitonal image.  Thanks.  Looking forward to the merge for this fix.  Thank you!
