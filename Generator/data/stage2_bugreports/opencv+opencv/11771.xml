	<summary>wrong seamlessClone assertionï¼Ÿ</summary>
	<description>
In the seamless_cloning.cpp (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/photo/src/seamless_cloning.cpp&gt;https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/photo/src/seamless_cloning.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
the line 94 asserts:

Why the maxxd is compared with dest.rows instead of dest.cols? (Also, the maxyd is compared with dest.cols).
I think the maxxd is on the width (col) direction, while the maxyd is on the height direction (row) direction.
Hence, it should be changed into:
CV_Assert(minxd &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; minyd &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; maxxd &lt;= dest.cols &amp;&amp; maxyd &lt;= dest.rows);

		Right!
PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/11208&gt;#11208&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 changed meaning of variables, but doesn't update check condition.
Perhaps this check can be removed at all, because it is redundant - dest(roi_d) operation has similar check inside.
