	<summary>Compilation failure with non-GNU C libraries (non-portable code)</summary>
	<description>
The problem is in the file "modules/core/src/parallel_pthreads.cpp", specifically between the lines 253 to 257:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#ifndef PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP
#define PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER
#endif

pthread_mutex_t ThreadManager::m_manager_access_mutex = PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For what I can see, the code uses a recursive mutex from pthreads, but I don't really understand how a recursive mutex works to create a patch or pull request.
The problem lies in the use of the constants PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP and PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER, which are defined in The GNU C Library (glibc), but they are not POSIX standard.
Because the the code is not standard, using others C libs that strictly follows POSIX guidelines, like musl libc, will result on a failed compilation.
One possible solution could be the one implemented in Alsa, where they have replaced the constant  with the constant  plus some initialization code. This way the entire code is portable across different C libraries.
You can view a patch in the following link:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://build.netitwork.net/package/view_file/FairWind:12.0/alsa/0014-conf.c-use-portable-way-to-initialize-recursive-mute.patch?expand=1&gt;https://build.netitwork.net/package/view_file/FairWind:12.0/alsa/0014-conf.c-use-portable-way-to-initialize-recursive-mute.patch?expand=1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Another recursive mutex related issue was recently opened, for a "compile problem on FreeBSD 10.2" &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/issues/5423&gt;#5423&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think both could be solved by changing the way recursive mutex are implemented.

		OS X &lt;= 10.6 is affected by this issue. 10.7 and later define PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP

 Does &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/5765&gt;#5765&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 patch work for you?

		Yes, it's compiling fine now.
Thank you for the pull request!
