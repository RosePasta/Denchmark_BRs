	<summary>split of a multidimensional matrix not working as in 2.4</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I have a 22x1024x1024 matrix with complex numbers (=&gt; 2Channels). When I perform the splitting function in Opencv 2.4, I get a vector of 2 matrices with 22x1024x1024 elements as expected. When doing the same split in Opencv 3.0, I get 2 matrices of 22x1024 elements with dims =2. Converting the matrix to a 2D matrix with 22x1048576 first and then splitting does give a good result in Opencv 3.0.
Best regards,
Sam.

		I have reported a similar issue before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5034&gt;#5034&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
There's an example attached you can run to see that cv::split is broken for ND-arrays.

		I see that there are 2 versions of "split". The one with output "Mat*" is working well. The other has failed like you said.
