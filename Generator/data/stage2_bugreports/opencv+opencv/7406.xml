	<summary>Illegal array access in makeAgastOffsets</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; d3930cd
Operating System / Platform =&gt; OSX / 10.10
Compiler =&gt; clang

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In makeAgastOffsets, there is a 16-long for-loop that indexes past the end of an 8- or 12-element array.
In particular, this part:
for( ; k &lt; 16; k++ )
pixel[k] = offsets[k][0] + offsets[k][1] * rowStride;
When makeAgastOffsets is called with a value of type that is NOT AgastFeatureDetector::OAST_9_16, such as AgastFeatureDetector::AGAST_5_8, the "offsets" array is 8 or 12 elements long, not 16, and the code will attempt to read past the end off "offsets"
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Build opencv with "-fsanitize=address", and then call something that eventually goes into makeAgastOffsets, such as cv::BRISK_Impl::detectAndCompute and watch what the values going into pixels[k] are.

 I guess you implemented the current running version of AGAST and it is fairly reasonable to get this fixed?
