	<summary>dev warning on build msvc solution with qt5</summary>
	<description>
This is not bug, but it does not look good

OpenCV version: 3.x
cmake 3.4.3
Qt5.5

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Warning ob build solution by cmake:
CMake Warning (dev) in E:/ocv/opencv_contrib/modules/cvv/CMakeLists.txt:
Policy CMP0020 is not set: Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain
target on Windows.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0020" for policy details.
Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
CMake Warning (dev) in modules/highgui/CMakeLists.txt:
Policy CMP0020 is not set: Automatically link Qt executables to qtmain

cmake_policy(SET CMP0020 OLD)
endif()
