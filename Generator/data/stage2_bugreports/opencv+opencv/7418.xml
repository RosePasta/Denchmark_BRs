	<summary>Shutdown camera in VideoCapture java wrapper is not possible</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Mac OSX
Compiler =&gt; XCode Version 8.0 (8A218a)

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried to experiment with VideoCapture class in java. It looks like there is a bug - it is possible to open the camera but closing is not possible.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This code leads to java crash ():
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    VideoCapture cap = new VideoCapture();

    cap.open(0); // camera is opening up 

    Mat img = new Mat();

    cap.read(img);

    cap.release(); // java crashes

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I have the same problem as well but I could Identify that it has to be something inside the Java wrappers on macOS.
I compiled the latest opencv-master to my MacBook (macOS Sierra 10.12 x86_64) and to my Raspberry Pi 3+ (Linux ARM) using
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -D BUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON ..
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then I tried abratchik's code snippet -&gt; Running the same code did work for the Linux arch but crashes on OSX.
So I think that this issue is probably related to Apple's change from QTKit to AVFoundation. (Could be related to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/7266&gt;#7266&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
The underlying C-Implementation seems to work though, as I could successfully release the VideoCapture using Python (at least it does not throw an exception)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
ret, frame = cap.read()
cap.release()
print("finished")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		It's fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/7833&gt;#7833&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Seems to be the same issue.
