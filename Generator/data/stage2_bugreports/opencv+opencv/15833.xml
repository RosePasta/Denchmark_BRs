	<summary>TypeError: Expected Ptr&amp;lt;cv::UMat&amp;gt; for argument '%s'</summary>
	<description>
This is about the uninterpolated '%s' in that error message.
Expected behavior: error message says which argument. In the following case it should have been interpolated to read 'img'.
Run this to reproduce:
import cv2 as cv
cv.line([], (0,0), (10,10), (0,0,255), 2)
# TypeError: Expected Ptr&lt;cv::UMat&gt; for argument '%s'
cv.circle([], (0,0), 10, (0,0,255), 2)
# TypeError: Expected Ptr&lt;cv::UMat&gt; for argument '%s'
Other APIs use the same error reporting scheme but interpolate properly. This bug is probably situated in or near the API implementations themselves.
compare to cv::rectangle, which has a different error reporting scheme:
cv.rectangle([], (0,0), (10,10), (0,0,255), 2)
# TypeError: an integer is required (got type tuple)

		For my case, it's soooooo dumb...., but the same error message
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;TypeError: Expected Ptr&lt;cv::UMat&gt; for argument '%s'&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

happened when I tried to perform a look-up table transformation for 'Image object' obtained by PIL.Image.open().
cv2.LUT(Image_object, look_up_table)

		Error message is not correct, but there is still an error in your code with passed parameters types (as your wrote 'Image object' which is not supported).
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/15918&gt;#15918&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you for your reply!
Sorry I think I should've said it more clearly.
What I meant to say was if you pass the 'Image object' created by PIL.Image.Open() into src(the first parameter of cv2.LUT) by mistake, you get the same error message.
That was my dumb mistake... hahaha
That was what I meant.

		in my code, I am just performing contrast enhancement   on image and try to save it a folder as shown below
from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance
image = Image.open('E:/Images/nonoise.jpg')
contrast = ImageEnhance.Contrast(image)
img1=contrast.enhance(2)
cv2.imwrite(os.path.join('E:/Images','contrast.jpg'), img1)
this code successfully performed the contrast enhancement but didn't save with an error:
cv2.imwrite(os.path.join('E:/Images','contrast.jpg'), img1)
TypeError: Expected Ptrcv::UMat for argument '%s'
Can someone tell me how to i solve it?
