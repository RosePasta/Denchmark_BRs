	<summary>videostab: crashes when radius &amp;gt; number of input frames</summary>
	<description>
If the sliding window radius is higher than the number of available frames, the program crashes at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/09b9b0fb9e9c9dd8c9e0d65705f8f19aa4c27f8a/modules/videostab/src/motion_stabilizing.cpp#L114&gt;motion_stabilizing.cpp#L114&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, unable to add the two matrices, since , i.e.  is 0x0 and the other matrix is 3x3
:
Run the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/09b9b0fb9e9c9dd8c9e0d65705f8f19aa4c27f8a/samples/cpp/videostab.cpp#L509-L514&gt;videostab example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the following options and test.avi only having a couple of frames

videostab test.avi --radius=400 --est-trim=no

Expected behavior
The parameter should state the "maximum sliding window width", e.g. when the number of available frames is lower, take all frames (and not more).
Plus, I'm wondering why it only crashes at radius &gt; number of frames and not already at radius*2 &gt; number of frames since I would expect the radius to be half of the window width.

		Performing the check from the outside (e.g. radius = min(radius, frame count ) is not possible in a reliable way, since
a) for a stream of frames we don't know how many will come
b) for a video file the given frame count is only a rough estimate.

		This seems related to the cache size: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/b46719b0931b256ab68d5f833b8fadd83737ddd1/modules/videostab/src/stabilizer.cpp#L272-L276&gt;stabilizer.cpp#L272-L276&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If we did not have a cache, the crash would probably occur earlier.

		i believe the error arises due to line 78 in motion_stabilizing.cpp where it should be:
for (int i = std::max(index - radius_, 0); i &lt;= std::min(index + radius_,size-1); ++i)
instead of :
for (int i = std::max(index - radius_, 0); i &lt;= index + radius_; ++i)
where size is size of array of motions matrix passed in function as argument

		Should be fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/pull/2424&gt;opencv/opencv_contrib#2424&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please test.
