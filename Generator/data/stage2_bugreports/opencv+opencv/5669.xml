	<summary>agast.cpp build fail on Raspberry Pi + gcc-4.6</summary>
	<description>
Hi All,
When I'm trying to build OpenCV 3.0 features2d module using standard gcc 4.6 compiler on my Raspberry Pi 2 (Raspbian Wheezy), I'm getting an internal compiler error, I guess the reason is in large code size or in aterrible amount of "goto" operators. The fail is listed below. All possible ccmake features were set to "ON".
Regards,
Andrey

		I proposed to fix this problem in pull request &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/5670&gt;#5670&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Also it reduces codesize up to 5-10 times with comparative performance

Could try this with newer gcc ? For my curiosity. I'll look at your proposed PR.
