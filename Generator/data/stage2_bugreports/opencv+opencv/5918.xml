	<summary>Regression in cap_gstreamer when viewing rtsp streams.</summary>
	<description>
At line 805 in cap_gstreamer.cpp the if(file) has been removed, this breaks accessing rtsp streams from axis surveillance cameras.
My pipeline string is:
rtspsrc location=rtsp://login:pass@192.168.1.51:554/axis-media/media.amp ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw, width=1920, height=1080 ! appsink
Adding if(file) back in at that line fixes the problem.  Not sure why it was removed.

		That looks to fix it as well.

		Hi.
Recently upgraded to version 3.1 from 3.0 and hit this issue. I use a pipeline to open an USB camera like this: "v4l2src ! video/x-raw ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! appsink"
I get this error: OpenCV Error: Unspecified error (GStreamer: unable to start pipeline) in icvStartPipeline ...
Tried both suggestions above: adding the if (file) condition in front of the block at line 805, and removing the stopPipeline(); line; both worked.
Being that this issue is already tagged as bug and has an assignee, I'd like to know the status of it: Should I create a pull request with a patch or should I just wait for it to be fixed?
Thanks.
