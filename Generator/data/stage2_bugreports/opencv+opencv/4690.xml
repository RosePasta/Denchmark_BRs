&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;samples/cpp/Qt_sample&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The folder QT_sample does not contain any Qt sample.
It contains an OpenGl sample
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hello Mehdi,

Thank you for posting this issue!

Actually this sample uses one feature from the Qt-backend - @displayOverlay@.
But still for now this sample is incorrect. The OpenGL API was changed and this sample must be updated according to the last changes.

Unfortunately, now we have limited human resources. If you could implement this functionality and send a pull request on GitHub (http://www.code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute), it would be very appreciated!
