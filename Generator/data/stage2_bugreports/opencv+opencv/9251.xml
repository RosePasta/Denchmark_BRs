	<summary>Tempfile-based image decoding does not properly check for errors</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When modules/imgcodecs/src/loadsave.cpp uses a temporary file for decoding an image, it does not properly check the return values of fwrite and fclose.  In the case that there is an error writing, such as if there is insufficient disk space, the file is silently truncated, which in the best case leads to an error decoding the image, and in the worst case, silent data corruption.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
