	<summary>build failure (link) with cudev in 4.0.0-beta</summary>
	<description>
I tried to build the 4.0.0-beta with all contrib modules under Windows 7, VS 2017, 64 bits.
with CUDA 10
Building opencv_cudev fails with error :
LNK2019	unresolved external "__declspec(dllimport) bool cv::__termination" (_imp?__termination@cv@@3_NA) in DllMain
it can be fixed by adding opencv_core400[d].lib in the dependencies of cudev

		I had two problems:
first the same as you
how to add, the property of cudev? but the opencv_core hasn't build , error can't open file “..\..\lib\Debug\opencv_core400d.lib”, and the core depend on cudev
second as:
error info: expression must have a constant value     opencv_core   in files type_traits tuple xutility xmemory0 algorithm, and so on
my system info:
win7 ultimate sp1 x64
vs2017 15.6.4
CUDA 9.0

		As for the one of above questions,
Q. how to add, the property of cudev? but the opencv_core hasn't build , error can't open file “....\lib\Debug\opencv_core400d.lib”, and the core depend on cudev
A.
Win10 + VS2017 + OpenCV 4.0.0-rc:
because of circular dependency, we can't directly add 'core project' to 'cudev' . so after first compilation (you may find cudev related error but core has been compiled correctly), you can add 'opencv_core400d.lib' to 'opencv_ cudev project' using ..
'opencv_cudev' properties &gt;&gt; linker &gt;&gt; input &gt;&gt; additional dependencies".
&lt;denchmark-link:&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


sorry for the Korean in my picture but I believe that you can identify the appropriate position.

'opencv_cudev' properties &gt;&gt; linker &gt;&gt; input &gt;&gt; additional dependencies".

but my first compile has been failed to execute, so there is no opencv_core400d.lib
I've tried to compile with vs2013，it's error info same with you, and makes opencv_core400d.lib. But in vs2017, it just makes opencv_cudev400d.lib, and can't continue to compile.
I have found the solution, using CUDA 10.0, and the compilation is success.

		This issue still exists for cuda 9.2 opencv 4 on windows 10.

cmake -DOPENCV_SKIP_DLLMAIN_GENERATION=ON

where i put this options?
