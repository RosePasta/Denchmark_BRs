	<summary>Calling .begin() or .end() on an empty Matrix leads to a division by zero exception.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1, 4.2
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2017

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Calling .begin() or .end() on an empty matrix leads to a crash. This is supprising. Especially, when you are using colRange (or rowRange) to calculate a subrange you want to process. If for some reason the range is empty (this happend for us in some edge cases), then an empty Mat is returned, which again leads to a crash when calling bagin (or end) on it.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

#include &lt;opencv2/core.hpp&gt;

cv::Range calcRange();

void main()
{
    cv::Mat m;
    m.begin(); // &lt;- crash
    
    cv::Mat1b b(5, 5);
    b.colRange(calcRange()).begin() // &lt;- crash when calcRange returns an empty Range
}
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Issue submission checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I report the issue, it's not a question


 I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues,
answers.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution


 I updated to latest OpenCV version and the issue is still there


 There is reproducer code and related data files: videos, images, onnx, etc

		You are correct, this is indeed an exception, coused by a division by zero. Nevertheless, this should work, shouldn't it?
