	<summary>loading SVM model not supported in python</summary>
	<description>
I'm using OpenCV 3.0-beta and it seems that, according to my experience with the ml python module and various sites (e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:http://answers.opencv.org/question/75077/opencv-300-python-svmload-is-missing/&gt;http://answers.opencv.org/question/75077/opencv-300-python-svmload-is-missing/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), the possiblity to load a serialized and stored svm from disk is not properly wrapped in the python bindings.
The issue could be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/4969&gt;#4969&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or even be the same.
Is there someone currently working on this issue?

		I wanted to provide a fix for this issue, but unfortunately the automatic build failed simply for differing ABI definitions. This is an intended solution, since I wrapped 2 functions for the python API.
I'm new to contributing to this project. I appreciate anyone, who helps me out and shows me what documentation I haven't read to fix this issue.

		Please do the same for ANN_MLP as it is affected by the same issue.
