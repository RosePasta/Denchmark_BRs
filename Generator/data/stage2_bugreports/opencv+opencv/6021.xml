	<summary>OpenCV 2.4.12.3 Python shared library issue</summary>
	<description>
I built Python 2.7.11 with the --enable-shared option on Ubuntu 14.04 using the following command:
./configure --prefix /usr/local/lib/python2.7.11 --enable-ipv6 --enable-unicode=ucs4 --enable-shared --with-cxx-main=/usr/bin/g++ LDFLAGS="-Wl,--rpath=/usr/local/lib/python2.7.11/lib"
Then created a virtualenv with this python. When I run Python from the command line it correctly prints that the version is 2.4.11.
Then I checked out the opencv release '2.4.12.3' and ran configure using the following command:
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$VIRTUAL_ENV/local/ -D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python -D PYTHON_LIBRARY=/home/ramnath/local/python2.7.11/lib/libpython2.7.so -D PYTHON_PACKAGES_PATH=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON _D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON -D WITH_V4L=ON -D CUDA_GENERATION=Auto -D WITH_CUBLAS=1 -D ENABLE_FAST_MATH=1 -D CUDA_FAST_MATH=1 -D WITH_OPENGL=ON -D WITH_QT=ON -D WITH_TBB=ON ..
This prints the following output:
-- Found PythonInterp: /home/ramnath/.virtualenvs/opencv2/bin/python (found suitable version "2.7.11")
-- Could NOT find PythonLibs: Found unsuitable version "2.7.6", but required is exact version "2.7.11" (found /home/ramnath/local/python2.7.11/lib/libpython2.7.so)
But if I proceed to make and install opencv it installs and I am able to do import cv2 in python interpreter.
My question is why is opencv saying the Pythonlib version is only 2.7.6 when it is clear that the python version is 2.7.11 (it is indeed finding the correct shared library file)?

		Could you try to reproduce problem with "master" branch?
Please also try CMake from Kitware site (via binary packages for Linux). There are few bugs with system CMake in Ubuntu 14.04 related to Python detection (related fix is available only for OpenCV master).

		I get the same Pythonlib detection problem when compiling the master branch using CMake 2.8.
But when I compile master branch using CMake 3.4.3 it is detecting the Pythonlib version correctly.
-- Found PythonInterp: /home/ramnath/.virtualenvs/opencvmaster/bin/python (found suitable version "2.7.11", minimum required is "2.7")
-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/local/lib/python2.7.11/lib/libpython2.7.so (found suitable exact version "2.7.11")

		Thanks for update!
What is about CMake 3.4.3 and OpenCV 2.4.x? Does it work?

		Yes I was able to compile OpenCV 2.4.12.3 with CMake 3.4.3 successfully. Thanks for the pointers.

		Thanks!
Unfortunately there is no easy workaround for Ubuntu 14.04 CMake. find_package(PythonLibs) doesn't work right with passed PYTHON_LIBRARY variable.
