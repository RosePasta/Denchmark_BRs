	<summary>Issue using stitching module</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 3.1.0-dev (master branch of 22nd July 2016)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 10 64 bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2013

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I wanted to do some research of image stitching with stitching module.
I compiled OpenCV 3.1.0-dev, master branch of 22nd July 2016 for Python 2. Then I executed following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import cv2

stitcher = cv2.createStitcher(False)
foo = cv2.imread('K:/foo.JPG')
bar = cv2.imread('K:/bar.JPG')
result = stitcher.stitch((foo,bar))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which resulted with following error message:
error: K:\opencv_install\opencv\modules\python\src2\cv2.cpp:163: error: (-215) The data should normally be NULL! in function NumpyAllocator::allocate
I'd appreciate some help regarding this issue. There were some workarounds for other functions like BackgroundSubtractorMOG2, but not for stitcher, so please help.

		Can confirm this issue.
System information (version)
OpenCV =&gt; 3.1.0.r1166.g5d7ee48-1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Linux (Archlinux) 64 bit
Compiler =&gt; GCC
I'm getting this error with a similar code :
OpenCV Error: Assertion failed (The data should normally be NULL!) in allocate, file /home/yho/.cache/pacaur/opencv-git/src/opencv/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp, line 150 Traceback (most recent call last): File "script/cv_controller.py", line 121, in &lt;module&gt; main_loop(simu.time()) File "script/cv_controller.py", line 95, in main_loop stitch_images(cam_buffer) File "script/cv_controller.py", line 65, in stitch_images stitched = stitcher.stitch(images) cv2.error: /home/yho/.cache/pacaur/opencv-git/src/opencv/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp:150: error: (-215) The data should normally be NULL! in function allocate
Using  which was cited as a workaround in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/6081&gt;#6081&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 did not help.

		Confirm the issue
System information (version)

Operating System / Platform =&gt; Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) 64 bit

I would like to investigate this bug, but I am not very proficient OpenCV developer, so help and guidance needed and appreciated. I will not assign this one to myself, because I am not sure if I can handle it.
upd The wise men said, that noobs won't handle it, so I give up.

cv2.error: D:\_d\OpenCV\opencv\modules\python\src2\cv2.cpp:152: error: (-215) The data should normally be NULL! in function NumpyAllocator::allocate
Tried compiling without OpenCL and/or switching off OpenCL with  as suggested in linked &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/6081&gt;issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Also tried using cv2.UMat:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;udimages == [&lt;cv2.UMat object at 0x066433C0&gt;, ...]
TypeError: images is not a numpy array, neither a scalar
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

... so, no luck.
If needed I could create a Callstack/Minidump.

		I looked at the Code and the other issues which seem related to this...
The problems seems to be that the input to Stitcher::stitch is a std::vector&lt;cv::Mat&gt;. Now Stitcher only accepts UMat (which is fine, in general, because UMat should abstract wether there is OpenCL support or not... if I understood it correctly), so in Stitcher::estimateTransform it does images.getUMatVector(imgs_) (which I guess is fine, too, but it does copy the data, which might be cheaper, or not...)
This calls getUMat on each cv::Mat, which uses the provided allocator... which is NumpyAllocator... which doesn't like data not being NULL.
I am not very familiar with the internals of OpenCV, but the question for me is... why? Why does it need to be NULL (or "should normally be NULL") and how do other algorithms handle this? It seems to me for "normal" allocations, when numpy is not involved, data is the original data which is then put into the allocated (U)Mat, which totally makes sense to me... how else would you get the original data in the new "buffer".. there are obviously 1000 and 1 ways, but this seems to me to be a "copy-constructor"-like situation, so I (again, without knowing a lot about OpenCV internals) that initializing a UMat with the NumPy allocator with existing data should be somehow supported.
I think one of the main issues why this might not be easily fixable is that the whole stitcher module uses UMat in a lot of places...

		Got it running for me, but I would really need someone who knows his way around OpenCV &lt;-&gt; NumPy to take a look
cv2.cpp: acount line 148 (currently)
UMatData* allocate(int dims0, const int* sizes, int type, void* data, size_t* step, int flags, UMatUsageFlags usageFlags) const
{
    PyEnsureGIL gil;
    // removed data != 0 check here
    // some stuff cut for brevity
    cv::AutoBuffer&lt;npy_intp&gt; _sizes(dims + 1);
    for( i = 0; i &lt; dims; i++ )
        _sizes[i] = sizes[i];
    if( cn &gt; 1 )
        _sizes[dims++] = cn;
    PyObject* o = NULL;

    if( data != 0 )
    {
        o = PyArray_SimpleNewFromData(dims, _sizes, typenum, data);
    }
    else
    {
        o = PyArray_SimpleNew(dims, _sizes, typenum);
    }
    // continue as before..
}
I think this is probably wrong on many levels considering "data" is probably just floating around with potentially no one cleaning it up...

		Did 7787 definitely fix this issue for people?  With a build of 3.2.0 I was still hitting
 cv2.error: /home/opencv/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp:152: error: (-215) The given data should normally be NULL there! in function allocate
Commenting out this line seemed to 'fix' the problem (at least, it successfully stitched some images together, and doing that didn't work for me in the previous release.)   OTOH, from comments above, maybe this line shouldn't be here - indeed it seems like the stitcher module.  Below is my repro:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import cv2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (cv2.__version__)
3.2.0-dev
&gt;&gt;&gt; stitcher = cv2.createStitcher(False)
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = cv2.imread("09500008-2101.png")
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = cv2.imread("09500008-2102.png")
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = stitcher.stitch((foo,bar))

		might be the reason listed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5667&gt;#5667&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  (see patricksnape's  solution)
