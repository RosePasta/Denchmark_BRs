	<summary>Remote code execution via heap corruption</summary>
	<description>
We've isolated a couple bugs that could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution on a victim's machine when processing an infected image with OpenCV.
We have more details and would like to responsibly disclose this to a lead developer.
Known vulnerable versions: Linux, OpenCV 3.0.0. Unverified but most likely works on all versions.

 Did you receive any actionable data on &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:admin@opencv.org&gt;admin@opencv.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rstevens70&gt;@rstevens70&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Since you requested CVE, I think it's up to you to provide the required data/information so that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vpisarev&gt;@vpisarev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is able to understand the issue and fix it. Can you at least share the reproducer files ?

 , yes we've received 3 sample files, in current version all three cases are handled correctly - an exception is raised.
This issue has been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/9376&gt;#9376&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 along with several others.
