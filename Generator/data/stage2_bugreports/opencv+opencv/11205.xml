	<summary>Possible leak in Python OnChange and OnButtonChange?</summary>
	<description>
I've just been reading through modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp and noticed a slight discrepancy.
There are 3 static handlers - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp#L1548&gt;OnMouse&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp#L1578&gt;OnChange&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp#L1611&gt;OnButtonChange&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. All three of them call the Python function as follows:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;PyObject *r = PyObject_Call(PyTuple_GetItem(o, 0), args, NULL);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Now,  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp#L1548&gt;OnMouse&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 continues in the following way:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if (r == NULL)
    PyErr_Print();
else
    Py_DECREF(r);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

whereas &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp#L1586&gt;OnChange&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp#L1628&gt;OnButtonChange&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 don't do a .
That seems a bit odd -- shouldn't there a be DECREF in all 3 functions?
