	<summary>cv::cuda::reduce to row and to col produce row vectors</summary>
	<description>
cv::cuda::redeuce's documentation states that:
Dimension index along which the matrix is reduced. 0 means that the matrix is reduced to a single row. 1 means that the matrix is reduced to a single column.
However that is not correct.  As can be seen &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/modules/cudev/include/opencv2/cudev/grid/reduce_to_vec.hpp&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for both gridReduceToRow and gridReduceToCol, a row vector is created.

		A row vector is used to create contiguous matrix, so that 1D indexing can be used.
