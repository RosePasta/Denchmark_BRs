	<summary>[3.1.0][OSX] Build with java doesn't produce dylib (via homebrew)</summary>
	<description>
I'm building OpenCV 3 for OS X (10.11.2) via Homebrew (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/opencv3.rb&gt;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/opencv3.rb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
Installing OpenCV 3.0.0 with --with-java placed a libopencv_java300.dylib inside /usr/local/Cellar/opencv3/3.0.0/share/OpenCV/java.
Since 3.1.0 this file is called libopencv_java310.so. The java apps using OpenCV stopped working.
