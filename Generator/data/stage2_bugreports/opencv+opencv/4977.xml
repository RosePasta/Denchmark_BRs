&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;OpenCV3 Manager - Incompatible version on Sony Xperia Arc S (LT18i)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I tried to install the armv7a-neon.apk package OpenCV3 Manager from the OpenCV 3.0 RC1 release, and although the install process was concluded with success the OpenCV Manager application didn't work. If opened it complains about "OpenCV Manager is imcompatible with this device."

I also tried the all the others manager versions included with the release (including with the binary one) but with the same result. With the OpenCV Manager 2.4.x I have no problems with this device.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
