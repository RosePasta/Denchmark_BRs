	<summary>Recent change to modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg_impl.hpp breaks on Ubuntu &amp;gt; 14.04</summary>
	<description>
Trying to build with CUDA support on a newer Ubuntu platform, and I am getting the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In file included from /home/nvidia/rjray-opencv/opencv/modules/videoio/src/cap_ffmpeg.cpp:47:0:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This seems to be due to the change in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/998c43ffea70b4ee46d8ec7233e044be6bbb847d&gt;998c43f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which un-did an earlier fix for libavcodec support for Ubuntu versions newer than 14.04.

		Please add information about ffmpeg version. Something like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;dpkg -l libav*
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I cannot comment on the ffmpeg source, I only know that it is failing on my systems that are newer than 14.04, as is the case with many of the commentators on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/998c43ffea70b4ee46d8ec7233e044be6bbb847d&gt;998c43f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The output from the dpkg command on the failing platform is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ii  libavc1394-0:a 0.5.4-2      arm64        control IEEE 1394 audio/video dev

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For comparison, the same output from the 14.04 machine that can build successfully:

ii  libavutil52:am 6:9.18-0ubun amd64        Libav utility library
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As you can see, there is a difference in the API versions (9 vs. 11). The change that was undone by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/998c43ffea70b4ee46d8ec7233e044be6bbb847d&gt;998c43f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 had allowed both to work.

		Poked around the Ffmpeg source for a bit, and looked at the headers that are installed on the machine that is failing to build.
It seems that the r_frame_rate member of AVStream did disappear at some point, but is now back in the structure. The API version in the repo source is also bumped up to 12 (from 11 in the libraries I have on the machine I'm using). I've been looking at the history of the file, but I cannot determine when the field was removed and when it was restored.

		Looks like problem is related to compilation with libav, not ffmpeg (Ubuntu 14.x uses "libav" by default, Ubuntu 15.x was switched back to ffmpeg).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/libav/libav/commit/85a5bc054c1290699ccbf5799ba6c4e2fbcc3530#diff-3fef4f3bf6d67e9b36fde174cb71341e&gt;libav commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with removal of .
Unfortunately, there is no entry in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/libav/libav/blob/master/doc/APIchanges&gt;API changes documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 about this, so need to guess some version with these changes.

		Yes, I finally stumbled upon that same commit yesterday. They later restored the field, because there wasn't anything else in the AVStream struct that provided the same information. The version of the libav* libs on 16.04 are after the field was restored, so they build OK (the test pass-rate is only 56%, but that's a different issue for another time). It seems that Ubuntu 15.04 (which is what I was building on in this case) has the "in-between" version of the AV libs, which are what break. I don't know what libs Ubuntu 15.10 uses, so it may only be 15.04 that has an issue.
It's worth noting (as an aside), that the FFmpeg git repo appears to be mirroring the libav stuff within it (and the GitHub repo for FFmpeg is just a mirror of their own public repo). But when I found this commit that you referenced, it was in the FFmpeg GitHub repo.

 Could you add version information? It looks like this (and it is usually located in  header file):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MAJOR  57
#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MINOR  48
#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MICRO 101
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		The version that was failing has the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MAJOR 56
#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MINOR  1
#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MICRO  0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For comparison, the version on Ubuntu 14.04 is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MAJOR 54
#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MINOR 20
#define LIBAVFORMAT_VERSION_MICRO  4
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
