&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Algorithm::load() not available for script wrappers&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;while trying to fix the ml-related python samples, i found
that it's impossible to load a serialized state from python atm.

adding a respective method like:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CV_WRAP static Ptr&lt;SVM&gt; load(const String &amp;fn)
{
    return Algorithm::load&lt;SVM&gt;(fn);
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
to each of the ml classes would fix it, but hopefully there might be a better way (without changing the interface)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Apparently they just never ended up writing the wrapper for this. My vote, use &lt;denchmark-link:http://scikit-learn.org/stable/&gt;sci-kit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I ended up doing this and it worked a lot better anyways. I also used PIL for the loading and saving of the trained network.

		I found that you can use
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;self.model = cv2.ml.SVM_load(filename)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

instead.

 ok so i'm on 3.1.0 cloned and built about a week ago.

		Any updates on this? I'm trying to use OpenCV3.1 on Android using the Java wrapper to do face detection using Hog detector with SVM.
OpenCV 3.1 (downloaded from the website) doesn't have Java wrappers for load()/read() in the SVM or StatModel class, and I really want to avoid using JNI to do C++ calls for the same. (Though yes I know the wrapper does precisely this internally).
I can't modify the wrappers as they are autogenerated, and I can't modify the libopencv_java3.so bundle, because it is a shared lib. Could I possibly make my own wrapper for SVM and StatModel that will work with the rest of classes of the Java wrapper?

		just compiled the latest stable version and still no load method for python
just why though...
but as stated when this issue was closed, tried version 3.2 you can use the load method in python

I found that you can use
self.model = cv2.ml.SVM_load(filename)

instead.

how to release the model,TKS;
