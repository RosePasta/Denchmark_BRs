&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;CUDA 6.5 NVCUVENC no longer supported&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I'm sorry ,maybe this bug had already been reported ,but I don't have much time to go through so many reported bugs to find it ,so I reported again .

When I CMake OpenCV 3.0 alpha with "WITH_NVCUVID" on ,I got the following error(I intalled the newest CUDA 6.5):

"CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
CUDA_nvcuvenc_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
    linked by target "opencv_cudacodec" in directory D:/ProgramFiles/OpenCV3.0_CUDA/sources/modules/cudacodec"

I read the CUDA 6.5 release notes,and found:

"Building applications with the CUDA Video Encoder interface is no longer supported; however, the driver will continue to run applications built against this
interface. We recommend using the NVIDIA Encoder API (NVENC), a newer video encoding interface that is available at https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-videocodec-sdk."

I also found in this address http://answers.opencv.org/question/43591/cuda-nvcuvenc-replacement/ ,the person encountered the same problem that OpenCV 3.00 alpha doesn't support the new CUDA API NVENC .

I hope you fix this bug in the future version of OpenCV ,as quickly as possible ,if you are not bothered.Thanks a lot!!
