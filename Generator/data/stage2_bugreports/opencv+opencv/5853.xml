	<summary>Mat::reshape() is called incorrectly in EM::predict()</summary>
	<description>
Although the documentation of EM::predict() states that the input can be 1xD or Dx1 because of the wrong usage of Mat::reshape() it only accepts 1xD inputs.
The fix is easy. The relevant line should reassign Mat::reshape():
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sample = sample.reshape(1, 1);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is very similar to the bug &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/4740&gt;#4740&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
