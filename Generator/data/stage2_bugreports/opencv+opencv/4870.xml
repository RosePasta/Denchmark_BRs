&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;jp2 imwrite does not work with larger images&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The following Python code loads the opencv logo and successfully saves it as a jpg2000 image.

test = cv2.imread("logo.png")
retval = cv2.imwrite("testout.jp2", test)

Upscaling the logo.png to 2000x2000 pixel causes the imwrite function to do nothing: no error, no file generated or anything - the return value is simply "false".

test = cv2.imread("logo_2x2.png")
retval = cv2.imwrite("testout.jp2", test)

The image is attached. You can avoid this a little, by forcing it to load as grayscale. But once the image gets bigger (i.e. 10 megapixel), it fails again. This seems to happen in c++ as well
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		This snippet of code seems to be working fine for me. Have you tried this on a different platform ? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04
