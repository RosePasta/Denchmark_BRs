	<summary>OpenCV 4.1.0 crashes at imgproc::pointSetBoundingRect(const Mat&amp; points)</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 4.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; IOS: 12.2
XCode 11

We have recently upgraded OpenCV from 3.4.6 to 4.1 and a crash appeared at cv::pointSetBoundingRect(cv::Mat const&amp;). Unfortunately, we do not have sample input that would cause the crash as when we run the app in Debug mode or when we add some LOGS, it doesn't crash anymore.
We are not using cv::pointSetBoundingRect(cv::Mat const&amp;) directly, but it is being called from cv::aruco::DetectInitialCandidatesParallel() and then from cvFindNextContour().
We have finally decided to give OpenCV 4.0.0 a try and we have seen that the crash doesn't happen anymore.
cv::pointSetBoundingRect(cv::Mat const&amp;) in OpenCV 3.4.6 and OpenCV 4.1.0 is exactly the same (line by line); however, in OpenCV 4.0.0 the method is completely refactored and easier to understand.
The method in OpenCV 3.4.6: 


opencv/modules/imgproc/src/shapedescr.cpp


         Line 739
      in
      33b765d






 static Rect pointSetBoundingRect( const Mat&amp; points ) 





The method in OpenCV 4.1.0: 


opencv/modules/imgproc/src/shapedescr.cpp


         Line 739
      in
      371bba8






 static Rect pointSetBoundingRect( const Mat&amp; points ) 





The method in OpenCV 4.0.0: 


opencv/modules/imgproc/src/shapedescr.cpp


         Line 737
      in
      75ed282






 static Rect pointSetBoundingRect( const Mat&amp; points ) 





As you will see, OpenCV 3.4.6 and 4.1.0(where crash happens) have exactly the same code, but 4.0.0 has a refactored version.
Maybe something went wrong during a merge request ?
P.S. On desktop the crash doesn't happen.
Thank you,

		Could you try latest code from master branch? (perhaps this fix may help to you: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/14889&gt;#14889&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
No significant difference is expected between master/3.4 branch for this function.

		Just tried the master branch out and seems to be working fine. Thanks
