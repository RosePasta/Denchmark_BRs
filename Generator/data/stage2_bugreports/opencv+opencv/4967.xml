&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Facedetect does not detect any faces with OpenCL enabled&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Using the following code, I can get detection to work if I turn off OpenCL.  However, with OpenCL on, I never get any faces.

&lt;pre&gt;
import cv2
import numpy as np

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier("/usr/share/OpenCV/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt_tree.xml")

faces = []
img = None

def detectFaces():
    retval, img = cap.read()

    grayImg = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)


    faces = faceCascade.detectMultiScale(grayImg, 1.1, 2)
    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
        cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

    cv2.imshow("Video", img)
    return faces

def testDetection():
    cv2.ocl.setUseOpenCL(False)
    while True:
        faces = detectFaces()
        if len(faces) &gt; 0:
            print("face detected, punk")
        if cv2.waitKey(1) &amp; 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
&lt;/pre&gt;

I've tried different cascades: frontfacial_defaul.xml and even lbpcascase_frontalface.xml with the same results.  OpenCL no work.  CPU-only, works.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Might be a leap to far, but in order to get the CUDA implementation to work, we added a GPU specific model folder, since the GPU implementation only seems to work with those models.
Can you please try using one of those models?

For 2.4 branch https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/tree/2.4/data/haarcascades_GPU
For master branch https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades_cuda
-   Status changed from New to Open
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I do not have an nvidia GPU.  I'm using Intel graphics hence why i'm playing with OpenCL.  Do I still need GPU specific cascades?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;seems like the cpu models should be the correct ones

Should I try these instead of the ones in master?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Philip L on 2015-04-14 19:24&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;no the ones in currently in the cascade folders are the correct ones for cpu and opencl thats what i just wanted to confirm.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Anyone been able to reproduce this?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;face detection tests pass on my macbook pro with HD5200 running OSX and the live demo work well. We also run tests on AMD machine with discrete GPU. I know that other team runs it on Intel GPUs under Windows.

So - no, we are not able to reproduce it so far.  Try Windows if you have access to one. I know that Linux OpenCL drivers for Intel chips are rather fresh, may be it's drivers that are to blame.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Im actually having issues on opencl cascade lbp code.
I trained a LBP cascade, where sometimes the cascade gets "stuck" at one particular position. no matter what the image is after that, the detection is always there. 
someone else getting the issue?
this does not happen with opencl switched off.
im using a mac book pro, on windows x64. opencv 3.0.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
