&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;CascadeClassifier training gets stuck when using LBP feature on Mac OS X&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;When I run train cascade with feature type LBP on Mac OS X 10.9 using openCV compiled with clang 5.1 (it does the same for clang 6.0 too), 
It gets stuck on stage 0 just after it prints out number of positives and negatives. All cores (There is multithreading code I guess) seems to be running but there is no progress. It does NOT have same behaviour for HAAR or HOG features. 

I am not sure, it can be a clang problem too. 

I tried on late 2013 Macbook Air with Mac OS X Mavericks. I compiled OpenCV from source
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hi Zafer,
thanks for reporting the issue!
Could you please provide code for reproducing?
-   Status changed from New to Open
-   Category set to objdetect
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I see this issue as well. It seems to get stuck in a parallel for loop.
I believe the training code expects ranges with &lt;.end&gt; less than &lt;.start&gt; to be null ops but the parallelization code for OSX (using GDC) gets stuck instead. I solved this for myself by inserting a construct:
if (stripeRange.end &gt; stripeRange.start) { ... }
around the relevant code at &lt;modules/core/src/parallel.cpp:283&gt;.

		Similar happened with me.  Osx 10.10, opencv 2.4.12.

		Try to reinstall opencv with multithreading feature. It worked for me. Namely, I run
brew install opencv3  --with-tbb
--with-tbb
Enable parallel code in OpenCV using Intel TBB
(I used this comprehensive instruction &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-3-on-yosemite-osx-10-10-x/&gt;http://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-3-on-yosemite-osx-10-10-x/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

's suggestion helped me. Thank you!

		In case if somebody is interested in future, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/artemb123&gt;@artemb123&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's suggestion does not work for me with opencv3, but with opencv2 works quite fine.
brew install opencv --with-tbb
Thanks.

		Hello all,
Has anyone else has tried artemb123 solution?
Has this been resolved?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martin82&gt;@martin82&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, in which file did you insert the struct? did this work for you?
Thank you,

 sorry for the late reply but did you figure it out? if not, provide me with the data and i will run some tests for you.

		OpenCL support in OpenCV 2.4 is experimental and it is not supported anymore. For OpenCL usage try OpenCV 3.x API.
In OpenCV 3.2 LBP cascades &lt;denchmark-link:http://pullrequest.opencv.org/buildbot/builders/master-mac/builds/10027/steps/perf_objdetect-ippicv-opencl/logs/stdio&gt;works fine on Mac&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (via Intel GPU OpenCL device).

		Still having the issue on my mac. While haar training works fine, LBP gets stuck
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;===== TRAINING 0-stage =====
&lt;BEGIN
POS count : consumed   1000 : 1000
NEG count : acceptanceRatio    3000 : 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Works fine on Linux.
