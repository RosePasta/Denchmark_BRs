	<summary>compile problem on FreeBSD 10.2, PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER</summary>
	<description>
Try to compile on FreeBSD 10.2, but get the follow error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;opencv/modules/core/src/parallel_pthreads.cpp:257:57 error: use of undeclared identifier
'PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER'
...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

A short search shows there is no portable way to statically initialize a recursive mutex. Anyone use opencv on freebsd would shine some light upon this? Thank you!

		Just build OpenCV without pthreads support by disabling the option in cmake?

		It looks like PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER is a GNU/Linux extension.
&lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7037481/c-how-do-you-declare-a-recursive-mutex-with-posix-threads&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7037481/c-how-do-you-declare-a-recursive-mutex-with-posix-threads&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

shows a way to initialize it dynamically but statically initialization is required here. Maybe we just need a static block here.

		Please see the issue that I just created, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/issues/5476&gt;#5476&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and comment if needed.
I think it has more information and is more general because affects all platforms.

 I have just modified file with this commit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/78376c0f63834642b8133ab5d3b5f658d65a0bb2#diff-44c4b36c20fff2956b4c317dd0502eea&gt;78376c0#diff-44c4b36c20fff2956b4c317dd0502eea&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

however, there are compile errors:
say  CV_SINGLETON_LAZY_INIT_REF is not declared in this scope
