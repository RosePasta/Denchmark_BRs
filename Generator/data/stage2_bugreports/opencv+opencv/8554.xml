	<summary>cuda fails on Jetson TX2</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; master ( 0a63ab3 )
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Jetson TX2 ARM 64bit Ubuntu 16.04
Compiler =&gt; GCC 5.4.0, CUDA 8.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


When running any module related to cuda, cudaarithm or cudaimgproc  etc..., following error occours

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;nvidia@tegra-ubuntu:~/opencv/build/bin$ ./opencv_test_cudaarithm

Available options besides google test option:
Usage: opencv_test_cudaarithm [params]

        --cuda_device (value:-1)
                CUDA device on which tests will be executed (-1 means all devices)
        -h, --help (value:false)
                Print help info

Run tests on all supported CUDA devices

I believe that this comes from hard coded capability value here
The TX2 has capability value 6.2 when TX1 has 5.3
I reviewed the system, and I think it's best to check the HW feature to determine TX1/TX2
The only difference of the HW feature is described in /proc/self/auxv so I think it's best to check this file
I'll create a PR for this

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


checkout recent master on JetsonTX2
usual cmake and make procedure
