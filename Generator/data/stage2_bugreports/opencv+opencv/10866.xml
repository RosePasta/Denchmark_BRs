	<summary>opencv2.framework for iOS is huge: 2GB</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; master branch of today (post-3.4.0)
OS =&gt; macOS 10.13.3
Compiler =&gt; Xcode 9.2
cmake version 3.10.2

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Trying to use OpenCV as a framework for iOS, I've noticed that opencv2.framework is huge: 2GB. I can't envision (anyone) to deploy an app that big (as of 2018). I can remember that some time in the past the framework size was more reasonable (&lt;300MB). According to the build options (see build command below), the build should be a release build.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

With the above system configuration and OpenCV source version, compile the OpenCV iOS framework using the following command: python opencv/platforms/ios/build_framework.py opencv-ios
