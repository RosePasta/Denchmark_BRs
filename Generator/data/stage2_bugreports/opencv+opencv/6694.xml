	<summary>OpenCV 2.x uses vulnerable version of libpng</summary>
	<description>
OpenCV 2.x (or at least the Android SDK version) uses a vulnerable version of libpng. Any applications uploaded to Google Play are given a warning and directed to this page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7011127&gt;https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7011127&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The vulnerability in question is &lt;denchmark-link:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8540&gt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8540&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which stems from an out-of-bounds memory access that could potentially lead to code execution Versions 1.0.x before 1.0.66, 1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.56, 1.3.x and 1.4.x before 1.4.19 and 1.5.x before 1.5.26 are affected.
Google is going to block apps using vulnerable versions of libpng after 17 Sep 2016.
