	<summary>svm.cpp - Incorrect error about k_fold parameter?</summary>
	<description>
Using train_auto() function, today I came across the following error message (svm.cpp, lines 1436-1439):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    //check that while cross-validation there were the samples from all the classes
    if( class_ranges[class_count] &lt;= 0 )
        CV_Error( CV_StsBadArg, "While cross-validation one or more of the classes have "
        "been fell out of the sample. Try to enlarge &lt;Params::k_fold&gt;" );
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I understand that the problem is that one the k_fold subsets does not contain samples from one of the classes. However, the recommendation is to enlarge k_fold. Shouldn't it be the way around, i.e. reduce the parameter?
Example: let's say we have 10 negative samples and 3 positive ones in the training dataset. Using k_fold = 4, one of the subsets won't have a positive sample, and thus the error will appear. If we enlarge k_fold to 6, then 3 of the subsets won't have a positive sample - we don't fix the error but make it worse.
If I'm right, I'll be glad to provide the corresponding PR.
