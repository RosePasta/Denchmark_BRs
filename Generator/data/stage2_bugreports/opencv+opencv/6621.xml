	<summary>Python examples for Hough lines and circles break when no segments found</summary>
	<description>
I've noticed that in the C++ examples there is a check for the result that the Hough lines and Hough circles functions return whether there are actually any segments (lines or circles) found. In Python this check is missing which leads to a crash of houghlines.py and houghcircles.py when no lines/circles are found.
