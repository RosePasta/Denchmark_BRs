&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Surfing between input channels&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hi. I have some capture cards with one chip but more cameras. With these capture cards Is possible to see one camera a time. In order to select which camera I want to watch with OpenCV is necessary to patch it.
The patch is very easy, How can I send it to the official developers?

Can you help me?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Since this PR was mentioned in june 2013 but since then not a single PR was done for this, I think we can close this for now.
