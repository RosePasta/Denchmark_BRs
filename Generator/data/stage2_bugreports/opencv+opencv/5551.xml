	<summary>findHomography leaves mask untouched in case of no inliers</summary>
	<description>
The inlier mask is left untouched in case of no solution: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/0688bb61ed33d66d6e0a736b75824eafa40d4f78/modules/calib3d/src/fundam.cpp#L411&gt;fundam.cpp#L411&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This means that

if we use an already populated mask as parameter (and this is allowed since the input values are completely ignored), the resulting mask stays the same which leads to the wrong conclusion
if we pass an empty mask and afterwards want to check for each provided point if it was an inlier, we get an index-out-of-bounds exception.

The latter problem even happens in official OpenCV code: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/0688bb61ed33d66d6e0a736b75824eafa40d4f78/modules/videostab/src/global_motion.cpp#L506-L508&gt;global_motion.cpp#L506-L508&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I propose to change the function so that the mask is always set to the appropriate size (and zeroed if needed). Is this feasible?

		I'll pick this task if needed.
@Admin, can you mark this as bug?
