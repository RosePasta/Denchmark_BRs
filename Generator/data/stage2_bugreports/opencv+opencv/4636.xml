&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Build problem on CentOs 6.4&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ffmpeg_video_source.cpp fails to build because it can't find the libavcodec.h, etc header files.  On my system they are in /usr/include/ffmpeg/libavcodec, etc.  Cmake (2.8.11.2) does find the location and includes it in CXX.includecache along with a couple of invalid locations for it.  Adding a -I /usr/include/ffmpeg in build.make got it to build, but it would be nice if cmake did its magic.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;History&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Well, thank you for the report, but CentOS is not in the list of officially supported OSes. OpenCV team doesn't even have CentOs workstation, so we can't reproduce the issue in order to fix it. So, it would be great if you fix the issue on your side and send the fix as a GitHub pull request.
-   Target version set to Next Hackathon

		We've successfully built OpenCV with FFmpeg support in CentOS 7, you need to install ffmpeg-devel package from rpmfusion or build and install FFmpeg manually.
