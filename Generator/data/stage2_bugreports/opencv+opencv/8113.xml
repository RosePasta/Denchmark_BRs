	<summary>MJPEG encoder uses wrong bit/pixel value.</summary>

 strm.putShort(channels); // bits per pixel 





Video encoded by this encoder doesn't play on windows media player because rgb will have bit/pixel value of 3.  Changing this to 8*channels, (in my case both 24 and 16 works) will help.  Windows 7, 64 bit, Windows Media Player: 12
