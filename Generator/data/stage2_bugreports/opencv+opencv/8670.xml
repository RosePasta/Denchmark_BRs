The string is self is different, but the meaning is OK. It's just that the comparison is too strict.
I looked in the code, and this line calls cv::write -&gt; cv::writeScalar -&gt; icvYMLWriteReal and at the end the call arrives to icvDoubleToString
in this icvDoubleToString, there is a sprintf, and this behaviour seems to differ from VS2012 and VS2015.
Thus, for VS2012 and older, the expectation string should be modified.
I'll make a patch as a PR later

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


cmake and build opencv_test_core from master
run opencv_test_core --gtest_filter=*Dmatch*
