&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;iOS 8 cvvideocamera&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Hey,
I am using Xcode 6 beta, I am developing an app with opencv my target was 7.1. Things were going so good. I am changing the target to iOS 8 beta.
Unfortunately my code is not going well. The button that starts the camera do not do any thing.
I got these warnings

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Mohammed, thank you for the report.
OpenCV community would really appreciate if you also provide a fix for this issue via a pull-request (see [[How to contribute]]).
If not, please wait for somebody else to take this task.
