	<summary>Bilinear upsampling layer shift</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenCV =&gt; 4.4
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 10 x64
Compiler =&gt; VS2019 (Used stock opencv)

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Mask shift apperas while tensorflow model inference, if model has Resize Bilinear Layer. There's no shift if ResizeBilinear layer replaced with ResizeNearest layer. Also tensorflow inference engine does not have this issue and works well with Bilinear and Nearest resize.
Here you can see results of inference:

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Issue submission checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I report the issue, it's not a question


 I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues,
answers.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution


 I updated to latest OpenCV version and the issue is still there


 There is reproducer code and related data files: videos, images, onnx, etc

		Can confirm this. üëçüèº

Results
Bilinear (TensorFlow)

Bilinear (OpenCV)


Initially it seemed like a precision loss, but results are far too different.
