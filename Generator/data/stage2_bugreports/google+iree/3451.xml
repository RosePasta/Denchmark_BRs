		I think this issue always existed (deleter of a different type used) but was not caught by asan because the size was the same between the two types. Adding a virtual destructor may be enough to get it to work.

		I wasn't able to repro using open source tools, so tested internally: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/iree/pull/3464&gt;#3464&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Virtual destructor indeed makes the ASAN error go away.
