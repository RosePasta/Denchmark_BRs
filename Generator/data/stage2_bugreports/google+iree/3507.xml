		It ends up with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;1x384xf32=[0.0425121 0.0425121 0.0425121...
1x384xf32=[0.208137 0.208137 0.208137 0.208137 ...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The expected output contains obviously different values.

		Not sure if this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/iree/issues/3489&gt;#3489&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I had a local change that produced correct output before the issue introduced.

		Same issue happens here (in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/iree/issues/3489&gt;#3489&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). The first dispatch function only has torch_index_select. It just load from the lookup table (which is constant). This can only repro with the whole model, but can't repro with single operation and flow vars.
