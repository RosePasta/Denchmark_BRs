	<summary>libTH doesn't recognize Intel MKL in its default location</summary>
	<description>
When building PyTorch from sources, libTH doesn't find Intel MKL in its default location (/opt/intel/mkl/include for includes and /opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64 for .so/.a). This can be worked around by adding these paths to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, but would be good if libTH searched default path by default: using system BLAS library on Linux is usually tremendously slower than Intel MKL, and its easy to not notice that libTH didn't find MKL.

		I think I'm having this issue as well.  I previously installed without MKL, but I decided to update to the latest binary and installed MKL in the process.  Now I'm getting the following error from import torch:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torch/__init__.py", line 45, in &lt;module&gt;
    from torch._C import *
ImportError: dlopen(/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torch/_C.cpython-35m-darwin.so, 10): Library not loaded: @rpath/libmkl_intel_lp64.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torch/lib/libTH.1.dylib
  Reason: image not found
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What do I need to do to fix it?

		Try . /opt/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64 or something similar.

		Hmm, maybe I'm having a different problem.  I installed MKL with anaconda as directed in the install instructions and it appears to have put it somewhere else.

 It's an unrelated problem. The issue is about the build not finding any MKL, while in your case it was found, but only at build time. I think you need to add the anaconda's  directory to .

		I encounter the same error, and I solve it by running command 'conda install mkl' in my activated conda env.

		I got same error when import torch.



import torch
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
File "/Users/username/anaconda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/init.py", line 56, in 
from torch._C import *
ImportError: dlopen(/Users/username/anaconda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/_C.cpython-36m-darwin.so, 9): Library not loaded: @rpath/libiomp5.dylib
Referenced from: /Users/username/anaconda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/lib/libTH.1.dylib
Reason: image not found



I searched with the file name "libiomp5.dylib", and find the path of this file: "/Users/username/anaconda/pkgs/intel-openmp-2018.0.0-hdd0ccc9_7/lib"
and then type below in terminal:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/Users/username/anaconda/pkgs/intel-openmp-2018.0.0-hdd0ccc9_7/lib"
solved!
