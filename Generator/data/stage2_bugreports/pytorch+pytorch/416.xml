	<summary>pytorch fails to compile on clang 6.0 (xcode 6.2)</summary>
	<description>
The main issue is this: &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11255027/why-user-defined-move-constructor-disables-the-implicit-copy-constructor&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11255027/why-user-defined-move-constructor-disables-the-implicit-copy-constructor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The brief error is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;note: copy constructor is
      implicitly deleted because 'unique_ptr&lt;THPVariableVersion, std::__1::default_delete&lt;THPVariableVersion&gt; &gt;' has a user-declared move constructor
    _LIBCPP_INLINE_VISIBILITY unique_ptr(unique_ptr&amp;&amp; __u) _NOEXCEPT
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The full error log is here:

		It is expected that it has a deleted copy constructor, it's a unique_ptr. Idk why is it trying to copy it, reserve should only alloc enough memory...

		here's some more context. &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21384955/does-stdvectorobject-reserve-method-need-a-copy-constructor-for-object-class&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21384955/does-stdvectorobject-reserve-method-need-a-copy-constructor-for-object-class&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Seems like a user-error.
maybe reserve when doing a new malloc requires the objects to be moved, and needs to trigger the copy constructor of the objects contained inside it.
the stack trace indeed shows this line:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;__swap_out_circular_buffer(__v);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Why is the copy-constructor having non-const input. That's the likely problem.

		Idk, to me looks more like an invalid implementation of stdlib in old clang, with an old stdlib, that didn't implement C++11 properly. It compiles fine with newer versions of both clang and g++. &lt;denchmark-link:http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/reserve&gt;Here is the specification for std::vector::reserve&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and it only requires the contained type to be , which is satisfied by having a move constructor. Do we really care about this, it's an old compiler and I doubt many people have that?
