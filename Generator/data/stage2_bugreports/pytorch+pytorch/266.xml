	<summary>cuda CrossEntropyLoss error</summary>
	<description>
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
x = Variable(torch.FloatTensor(5, 20).normal_(), requires_grad=True)
y = Variable(torch.LongTensor(4).random_(20))
loss_fn(x, y).backward()
this will raise a clear error message:
Assertion THIndexTensor_(size)(target, 0) == batch_size' failed
However, when everything is put on cuda, it raises:
RuntimeError: cuda runtime error (77) : an illegal memory access was encountered at /home/guismay/pytorch-master/torch/lib/THC/generic/THCTensorCopy.c:81
moreover, after such a bug, I have to restart the notebook as everything involving cuda will raise an illegal memory access

		This has been fixed upstream.
Now, even on CUDA, you'll get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;RuntimeError: mismatch between the batch size of input (5) and that of target (4) at /home/fatbox/code/pytorch/torch/lib/THCUNN/generic/ClassNLLCriterion.cu:3
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
