	<summary>Tensorboard: ValueError: Duplicate plugins for name projector</summary>

I follow the introduction and happened to this error.
cuda10, cudnn7, install pytorch by pip.
however, when I check by
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This sounds like a misconfiguration issue with tensorboard. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lanpa&gt;@lanpa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you know if this is a PyTorch bug or not?

		This issue is caused by tb-nightly, and tb-nightly is difficult to uninstall.
I rebuilt the environment and use the tensorflow, tensorboard, tensorboardx without the tb-nightly this time, and the issue is gone.

 Yes. I first try uninstall the tb-nightly many times but it still there. I don't know why.
You can build a new environment, install tensorflow, tensorboard, tensorboardx, espically, don't install tb-nightly.

 it does not suitable for me, I can successfully uninstall tb-nightly. and yes I am really using another environment to use tensorboard

, I also met the problem but I fixed it. My method is:

I downloaded a test script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/master/tensorboard/tools/diagnose_tensorboard.py
I run it and it told me that I have two tensorboards with a different version. Also, it told me how to fix it.
I followed its instructions and I can make my tensorboard work.

I think this error means that you have two tensorboards installed so the plugin will be duplicated.  Another method would be helpful that is to reinstall the python environment using conda.
Hope to help you.

But the solution given by the script is to uninstall tensorboardX and tb-nightly, and install tensorflow.

 I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ElegantLin&gt;@ElegantLin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TomorrowIsAnOtherDay&gt;@TomorrowIsAnOtherDay&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 You can open a new conda environment and pip install ,  for a pure pytorch setting.

		&lt;denchmark-code&gt;### Suggestion: Fix conflicting installations

Conflicting package installations found. Depending on the order of
installations and uninstallations, behavior may be undefined. Please
uninstall ALL versions of TensorFlow and TensorBoard, then reinstall
ONLY the desired version of TensorFlow, which will transitively pull
in the proper version of TensorBoard. (If you use TensorBoard without
TensorFlow, just reinstall the appropriate version of TensorBoard
directly.)

Namely:

	pip uninstall tb-nightly tensorboard tensorflow-estimator tensorflow-gpu tf-estimator-nightly
	pip install tensorflow  # or `tensorflow-gpu`, or `tf-nightly`, ...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I experienced the same issue, and uninstalling and reinstalling tensorboard and tensorflow didn't help. In my case, I had a ghost copy of tensorboard 2.0.0 that had apparently not been uninstalled completely. It appeared in pip as "-ensorboard". Deleting the corresponding dist-info folder in my python environment fixed the problem.

		Someone ats(@) me. I always used conda to manage my Python environment. So if I met the problem that I could not uninstall it successfully, I would delete the environment and restart a new one. I hope this helps.

I have tensorflow 1.14 for python2 and tensorflow 2.0 for python3, this scrip doesn't have any actions suggestions. Does it mean that my enviroment of tensorflow has no problem?

@Biaocsu, I also met the problem but I fixed it. My method is:

I downloaded a test script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/master/tensorboard/tools/diagnose_tensorboard.py
I run it and it told me that I have two tensorboards with a different version. Also, it told me how to fix it.
I followed its instructions and I can make my tensorboard work.

I think this error means that you have two tensorboards installed so the plugin will be duplicated. Another method would be helpful that is to reinstall the python environment using conda.
Hope to help you.

		Hello, I had the same problem today, and I fixed with the following simple steps:
I navigated to the directory from where the error was coming from - site-packages - tensorboard.
Since, tensorflow object detection API 's tf.contrib does not work in tensorflow 2.0, I had tensorflow 1.14 installed in my computer to run the detection model.
So, when I navigated to the directory 'tensorboard' inside site-packages - I found "tensorboar-2.0.2.dist-info, and tensorflow_estimator-2.0.2.dist-info'. I removed these files from the directory, and the problem was solved.

Solved!
I deleted the tensorboard-2.0.0.dist-info folder from Lib/site-packages then tensorboard works.
But I don't know whether it would cause another problem or not.

		I was also thinking the same, if some error pops up, however, none faced so far...
The safest way is to not delete, however, keep the files somewhere else... as python searches the file in that specific folder only, and gets confused :)

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Symptom 1 Tensorboard: ValueError: Duplicate plugins for name projector&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Download diagnose script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/master/tensorboard/tools/diagnose_tensorboard.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Execute it and follow its instruction:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python diagnose_tensorboard.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Symptom 2 Tensorboard: ValueError: Duplicate plugins for name projector and diagnose script shows no action&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run pip freeze to see if you get this warning WARNING: Could not generate requirement for distribution -ensorboard 2.1.0
If yes, then there is a ghost copy of tensorboard. Hopefully, the fix below has no side effect, I am not sure about it.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd &lt;site-packages&gt;
rm -rf "~ensorboard"
rm -rf "~ensorboard-2.1.0.dist-info"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		The following solution ALWAYS works for me irrespective of the updates made to tensorboard (eg: The new packagetensorboard-plugin-wit released in Feb 2020, is causing issues to many people here, and there can be other updates in the future).
Add the following code snippet in every colab tutorial before you load tensorboard.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Remove all TensorBoard packages.
! pip list --format=freeze | grep tensorboard | xargs pip uninstall -y
# Install TensorFlow again (This command will only install the default TensorBoard package associated with this TensorFlow package). 
! pip install -q tensorflow
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

@Biaocsu, I also met the problem but I fixed it. My method is:
1. I downloaded a test script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/master/tensorboard/tools/diagnose_tensorboard.py

2. I run it and it told me that I have two tensorboards with a different version. Also, it told me how to fix it.

3. I followed its instructions and I can make my tensorboard work.

I think this error means that you have two tensorboards installed so the plugin will be duplicated. Another method would be helpful that is to reinstall the python environment using conda.
Hope to help you.

Run the following code if it shows two tensorboard installed on your system remove one.
import pkg_resources
for entry_point in pkg_resources.iter_entry_points('tensorboard_plugins'):
print(entry_point.dist)

-nightly
-b-nightly 2.5.0a20210112
tensorboard 2.4.0
tensorboard-plugin-wit 1.7.0

result &gt;
pip uninstall -b-nightly &lt;= can not uninstall
you should direcretly delete folder;
ex&gt;
you find folder ex&gt; python -m site
~-_nightly-2.5.0a20201223.dist-info
~-_nightly-2.5.0a20210112.dist-info
~b_nightly-2.5.0a20201223.dist-info
