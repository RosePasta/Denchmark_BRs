	<summary>Prediction on FPGA doesn't work without -cache option</summary>
	<description>
There's a problem when we run prediction using binaries (.elf, .so, .a) on FPGA without -cache option of generate_project.py.
OK and NG patterns of the command are below.
OK (udmabuf is enabled):
python blueoil/converter/generate_project.py -i minimal_graph_with_shape.pb -o projects -p udma -hq -ts -cache
NG (udmabuf is disable and /dev/mem is enabled instead):
python blueoil/converter/generate_project.py -i minimal_graph_with_shape.pb -o projects -p no_udma -hq -ts
Regarding to NG pattern, binaries compiled from the project doesn't work.
The program should work without -cache option.
So we need to fix it.
