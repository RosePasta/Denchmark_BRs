	<summary>VGG19 Weights</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I have just minor question about pretrained model VGG19 in your network.
In line 151-154 of file &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/blob/master/src/loss.py&gt;loss.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you are using weights relu3_2 twice.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;for x in range(12, 14):
    self.relu3_2.add_module(str(x), features[x])

for x in range(14, 16):
    self.relu3_2.add_module(str(x), features[x])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Doesn't it suppose to be relu3_2 for the first one and relu3_3 for next one?

 That's what it's supposed to be! Thanks for your attention.
The good news is that the pre-trained weights are not affected. I just checked our development code base. There must have been a mistake in the release code.
