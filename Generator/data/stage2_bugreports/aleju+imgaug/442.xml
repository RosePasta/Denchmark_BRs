	<summary>Resize precision issue.</summary>
	<description>
Hello, when converting a image to float type and calling Resize operation, we found that it is different with the result by only using cv.imread(). Then, we find that
# in imgaug/augmentors/size.py line: 373
 if not isinstance(images, list):
     all_same_size = (len(set([image.shape for image in result])) == 1)
     if all_same_size:
         result = np.array(result, dtype=np.uint8)
if the input is not list, it will make a numpy array and convert to uint8. The opeartion will result in the inconsistent with our expectation.
While, we could pass the parameters with (images=[image]) to solve the problem, but I'm not sure the intention to do that.
Best,
KJ
