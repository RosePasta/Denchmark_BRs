	<summary>Problem with data augmentation in spleen example notebook</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I was trying out the spleen_segmentation_3d.ipynb and encountered problem with data transformation. In the 'Setup transforms for training and validation' section, the line Spacingd(keys=['image', 'label'], pixdim=(1.5, 1.5, 2.), interp_order=(3, 0), mode='nearest'), keeps causing error. After I checked the documentation, it seems like the argument interp_order
should be a string rather than a tuple of int. It seems like this is the case in other example notebooks as well, was there a code base change that leads to this problem or is there anything I missed?
To Reproduce
Run through the notebook.
Expected behavior
It should run without any error.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS
Python version
MONAI version [e.g. git commit hash]: 0.1.0
CUDA/cuDNN version
GPU models and configuration

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/neshang&gt;@neshang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Thanks very much for your bug report.
We just updated the API of Spacing yesterday and didn't update the examples.
I already submitted a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/pull/513&gt;#513&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  to update it.
Thanks.
