	<summary>compatibility with pytorch 1.7</summary>
	<description>

pytorch 1.7 is available, there're some compatibility issues such as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/runs/1315919388#step:8:15470&gt;https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/runs/1315919388#step:8:15470&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Hi @wyli ,
Thanks for raising this topic, let me try to figure out this particular issue.

I partly fix this issues here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/commits/1149-torch-1-7&gt;https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/commits/1149-torch-1-7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

the corresponding full test results are here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/runs/1316826365&gt;https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/runs/1316826365&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

could you please continue working from that branch

		For what it's worth, running  with pytorch 1.7 locally, I get a few more errors as well. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/files/5452052/error.txt&gt;attached&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 file. Although I haven't checked if all errors are specifically related to pytorch1.7.

For what it's worth, running ./runtests.sh --quick with pytorch 1.7 locally, I get a few more errors as well. See attached file. Although I haven't checked if all errors are specifically related to pytorch1.7.

those are all fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/commits/1149-torch-1-7&gt;https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/commits/1149-torch-1-7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

there are some additional issues

on windows for the multiprocess data loading
some reproducibility issues related to the deterministic seeds
linux cpu tests took too long (60min+)

		Great thanks. Perhaps in the meantime, we should modify &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/master/requirements.txt&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from  to . Otherwise, users will get the problematic 1.7 by default (I do at least).

Could you please submit all your fix as a PR? I didn't which issue you already fixed and which is not.
Thanks.

Thanks.

you can find the diff here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/compare/1149-torch-1-7&gt;https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/compare/1149-torch-1-7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

PR will trigger too many github notifications I was trying to avoid that.

Great thanks. Perhaps in the meantime, we should modify requirements.txt from torch&gt;=1.5 to torch&gt;=1.5,&lt;1.7. Otherwise, users will get the problematic 1.7 by default (I do at least).

I just got into this situation. I will need to downgrade pytorch.

We've merged the temporary fix here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/pull/1151&gt;#1151&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If you already have pytorch 1.7, you should be able to pip uninstall it and then re-install the correct versions via the  files.
