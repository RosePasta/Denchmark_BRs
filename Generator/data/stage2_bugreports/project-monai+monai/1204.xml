	<summary>Integration test failed but report passed</summary>
	<description>

I found an issue in our CI test env, the integration test failed in the log but the final result is "passed".
Take the latest PR for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/runs/1368333959#step:7:10824&gt;https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/runs/1368333959#step:7:10824&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks.

Sorry about this, certainly looks my fault.

No problem, could you please help submit a quick PR to fix it?
Don't worry about the CI error about DiceMetric, I fixed in another PR.
Thanks.
