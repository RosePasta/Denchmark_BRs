	<summary>PyTorch 1.6 is not optimized for docker 20.08</summary>
	<description>

In order to avoid PyTorch 1.7 CI test errors, we temporarily forced PyTorch version to &gt;=1.5 and &lt; 1.7, it will uninstall the optimized PyTorch in docker 20.08 and install 1.6.0 instead.
According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IsaacYangSLA&gt;@IsaacYangSLA&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's training test, the training speed is 2x times slower in latest MONAI docker(reinstall 1.6) because the original torch in the docker was optimized by NVIDIA team.
Need to restore the torch of PyTorch 20.08 docker as the base of MONAI docker.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wyli&gt;@wyli&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Could you please help restore the Dockerfile to use the original torch in docker 20.08?
This can be very important for us to compare the training speed of MONAI with other internal projects.
Thanks in advance.
