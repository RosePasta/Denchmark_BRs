Describe the bug
Recently, we added several new medical metrics and I found some segmentation metrics don't handle batch and channel dims which are the aligned data shape in MONAI.
Like MeanDice metric, I think we should compute segmentation metrics on [B, C, H, W, ] data and return M x N results, where M corresponding to batch dim and N corresponding to channel dim. Then compute the average value after 1 epoch.
And it should handle both non-one-hot and one-hot labels.
Please feel free to correct me if I misunderstand anything.
