Thanks for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/madil90&gt;@madil90&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's bug report,  transform can work on normal  data but can't work on a tensor in graph:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR - Exception: Applying transform &lt;monai.transforms.compose.Compose object at 0x7f0700e9deb8&gt;.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/madil/dlmed/code/MONAI/monai/transforms/utils.py", line 309, in apply_transform
    return transform(data)
  File "/home/madil/dlmed/code/MONAI/monai/transforms/utility/dictionary.py", line 406, in __call__
    d[new_key] = copy.deepcopy(d[key])
  File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/copy.py", line 161, in deepcopy
    y = copier(memo)
  File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/tensor.py", line 38, in __deepcopy__
    raise RuntimeError("Only Tensors created explicitly by the user "
RuntimeError: Only Tensors created explicitly by the user (graph leaves) support the deepcopy protocol at the moment
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Need to fix it for post transforms.
