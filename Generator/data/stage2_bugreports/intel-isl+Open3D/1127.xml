	<summary>camera.PinholeCameraIntrinsic.set_intrinsics, TypeError</summary>
	<description>
the errors is like this
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "read.py", line 116, in &lt;module&gt;
    intr.set_intrinsics(width=width,height=height,fx=fx,fy=fy,cx=cx,cy=cy)
TypeError: set_intrinsics(): incompatible function arguments. The following argument types are supported:
    1. (self: open3d.open3d.camera.PinholeCameraIntrinsic, width: int, height: int, fx: float, fy: float, cx: float, cy: float) -&gt; None
Invoked with: kwargs: width=640, height=480, fx=575.816, fy=575.816, cx=320.0, cy=240.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

i've tried int(width/height), float(cx/cy/fx/fy), but the problem still exist, how can i solve it?
