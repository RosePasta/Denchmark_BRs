	<summary>Cannot install the py3d package with Linux+Python</summary>
	<description>
I have been struggling to make a python package install in the Travis CI for some hours now!
The command pyenv global 3.6 utilized to setup the Travis CI Linux-image seems to encapsulate Python inside a virtual environment. The problem is that CMake script cannot figure out the correct site directory to install py3d.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so python library.
However, I believe there is something wrong with the .travis.yml setting, and we should not use pyenv global 3.6. Another interesting thing is that Ruby image is loaded by this setting file, instead of Python, or GCC or similar things...
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Both Python scripts utilized inside the CMake:
import site

print([path for path in site.getsitepackages() if path.endswith('packages')][-1])
and
from distutils import sysconfig

print(sysconfig.get_python_lib())
returns the virtualenv site-packages that is not gloabl site-package, and any installation to is does not get detected.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

/opt/pyenv/versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

/opt/python/3.6.3/lib/python3.6/site-packages
I even tried echo "/opt/pyenv/versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/" &gt; /opt/python/3.6.3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/open3d.pth; without any success.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Travis CI output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;...
-- Installing: /opt/pyenv/versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/py3d.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

		I agree.  was some trick to give python 3.6 environment. It was okay until we reached to the installation issue. BTW, I think this is addressed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/commit/c071cd339c15aa3eba32a2d691c42a1e6c5d8883&gt;c071cd3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Am I correct?

 Not yet. I cleaned it a little bit, but we still have the Linux issue persisting
