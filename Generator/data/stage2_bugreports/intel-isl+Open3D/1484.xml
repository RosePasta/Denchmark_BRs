	<summary>3D Model (.obj) texture not loading correctly.</summary>
	<description>
When I load this model in other software it appears correctly as this:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590151/73598370-5e1ab280-44ec-11ea-9491-f60c69e64435.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But with Open3D the texture is all messaged up:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590151/73598354-33305e80-44ec-11ea-8797-b55a55020f91.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/590151/73598355-3a576c80-44ec-11ea-9960-fa70fde3551b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here is the code I'm using:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import open3d as o3d

def visualize(mesh):
    vis = o3d.visualization.Visualizer()
    vis.create_window()
    vis.add_geometry(mesh)
    vis.run()
    vis.destroy_window()

def main():
    mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("scene_mesh_decimated_textured.obj")
    visualize(mesh)

main()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And here is the model and texture:

		The obj file you shared the multiple materials (8 texture maps and materials). I think the following line would affect the issue


&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/theNded&gt;@theNded&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Is this related to the fact that the textured mesh only can store a single texture map?
I also presume the issue comes from an inaccurate decoding UV coordinate.

Open3D/src/Open3D/IO/FileFormat/FileOBJ.cpp


        Lines 148 to 157
      in
      44a3597






 // Now we assert only one shape is stored, we only select the first 



 // diffuse material 



 for (auto&amp; material : materials) { 



 if (!material.diffuse_texname.empty()) { 



         mesh.texture_ = *(io::CreateImageFromFile(mtl_base_path + 



                                                   material.diffuse_texname) 



                                   -&gt;FlipVertical()); 



 break; 



     } 



 } 





@theNded Is this related to the fact that the textured mesh only can store a single texture map?

I see. This is due to the legacy architecture design
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/src/Open3D/IO/ClassIO/TriangleMeshIO.cpp#L75-L84&gt;https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/src/Open3D/IO/ClassIO/TriangleMeshIO.cpp#L75-L84&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

where only one mesh is supported for IO. It would be non-trivial to change the interface, but I will try to see if we can find a workaround.

 this works well, except I'm not sure if there is a way to crop them, is there a way to do that?
Thank you so much!

		I think that might have been a pre-existing limitation on Open3D, so might not be related.

		Hi,
I‚Äôm working with the Python version Open3D 0.10.0.1. Using MeshLab my example mesh is showed like this
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42244318/90468149-ea38a400-e0e3-11ea-94bd-97abe48a9a78.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But when I load and display the mesh with Open3D the window goes blank
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42244318/90468290-3be12e80-e0e4-11ea-800b-9fac8e281ca9.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

My code goes like this:
mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh(‚Äúpath/to/mesh‚Äù) o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([mesh]) 
I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm doing something wrong or if it is an issue. Can you please help me??!!!
I‚Äôm gonna let this link below in case you wanna test it

		I think this may not be a blank window, but the mesh is all white, you can try assigning a different color for the mesh. . Then see what happens &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ArlenisChS&gt;@ArlenisChS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Oh yes, sorry for not putting what was happening. I was painting the mesh with MeshLab and when saving it into a .ply the color seem to be set to white. It seems like I needed to save the mesh activating some flags, wish I did it and now it works. Thanks for the help!! ü§ó

		Hi,
I am trying to load the attached .obj and corresponding .mtl files. However, I am getting the following warning message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[Open3D WARNING] Read OBJ failed: Both `d` and `Tr` parameters defined for "m15". Use the value of `d` for dissolve (line 88 in .mtl.)
Both `d` and `Tr` parameters defined for "m17". Use the value of `d` for dissolve (line 103 in .mtl.)
Both `d` and `Tr` parameters defined for "m19". Use the value of `d` for dissolve (line 118 in .mtl.)


Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then I've manually removed the Tr values but it still segfaults without any output error.
Any idea what could be wrong?
The code I am using is the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    os.chdir("./model/house/0004d52d1aeeb8ae6de39d6bd993e992/")
    mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("./house_room2.obj",print_progress = True)
    o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([mesh])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
