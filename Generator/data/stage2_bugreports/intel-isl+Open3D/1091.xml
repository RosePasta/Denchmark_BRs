	<summary>Little error in the reconstruction system example</summary>

Describe the bug
In make_fragments.py, line 27, in the example of the git, I got :
rgbd_image = o3d.geometry.RGBDImage.create_from_color_and_depth(color, depth, depth_trunc=config["max_depth"], convert_rgb_to_intensity=convert_rgb_to_intensity)
and got an error telling that there is no create_from_color_and_depth() method in the RGBDImage class
The method to be called is (if I am not wrong) :
create_rgbd_image_from_color_and_depth() that is in the o3d.geometry class.
Well at least it works perfectly for me with the following line :
rgbd_image = o3d.geometry.create_rgbd_image_from_color_and_depth(color, depth, depth_trunc=config["max_depth"], convert_rgb_to_intensity=convert_rgb_to_intensity)
Environment

		That is because the Open3D API did change. The example code in the git master branch reflects the new API which is not compatible with the one you get when installing via pip.
