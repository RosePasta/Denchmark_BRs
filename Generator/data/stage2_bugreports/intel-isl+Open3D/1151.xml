	<summary>Is there a bug in estimate_normals?</summary>
	<description>
I am computing normals for a point cloud and they all appear to be in the positive x-direction?
I have my code here:

		I think you already have a solution in the stackoverflow thread. Just for completeness: estimate_normals just fits a plane in the vicinity of a given point and from this plane we derive the normal of the point. However, there are always two possible normals  +-n and we need other methods to align them.
