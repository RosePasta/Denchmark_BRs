	<summary>VisualizerWithEditing: No filename is given. Abort saving.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Python's VisualizerWithEditing doesn't bring up save file dialog.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

pip3 install open3d-python


#!/usr/bin/python3

from open3d import *

if __name__ == "__main__":
   pcd = read_point_cloud("./examples/TestData/fragment.ply")
   vis = VisualizerWithEditing()
   vis.create_window()
   vis.add_geometry(pcd)
   vis.run()
   vis.destroy_window()

Press K, select a square area, press C.
Error:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Cropping geometry: [========================================] 100%
No filename is given. Abort saving.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
A dialog to save file pops up.
Environment:

OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.5
Open3D version: 0.6.0.0-cp36
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: pip3

Additional context
It would be nice to be have API to VisualizerWithEditing to set a fixed file name for storing crop results.

		The issue was that I'm running a non-interactive shell, otherwise ncurses interface shows a dialog to enter file name. But it would be still nice to allow a fixed file name.

		How did you run on "non-interactive shell", could you share the procedure? It works for me for both cases: 1) running it as a .py script, or 2) in a python interactive shell.

		I run it as an external command in vim :!./crop_save_fail.py.

		Also, looks like the python path is hardcoded, is open3d installed in the environment of #!/usr/bin/python3?

		I changed it to #!/usr/bin/env python3 but it didn't make any difference.

		Actually, you can avoid the file dialog by changing the constructor to vis = VisualizerWithEditing(-1, False, ""). In the last string parameter you could also define a default directory (otherwise the cwd will be used).
