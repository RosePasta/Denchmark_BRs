	<summary>Windows x86 testing + possible failures</summary>
	<description>
The current AppVeyor settings only tests Windows x64 platform, but what about x86?
There is a possibility that Windows x86 would fail (such as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://ci.appveyor.com/project/syncle/open3d/build/1.0.202/job/wp3w4bybtru4bh85&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). The failure might be just due to changes I made, so I will investigate further and update!

		Actually I suggest we focus on x64. We already have lots of stuff to worry about and I don't think x86 is a frequent use case.
