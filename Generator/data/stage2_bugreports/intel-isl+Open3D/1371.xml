	<summary>MacOS: Cannot save screen capture to file</summary>

Describe the bug
I would like to make a video of point clouds using open3d visualization, but whenever I run the open3d visualization, it is impossible to write anything to file. plt.imsave, plt.savefig, cv2.imwrite, etc., all cannot write to file, even if the data I am trying to write to file is not the open3d visualization.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Below is some minimal code to reproduce the issue. No matter how I played around with this code, I could not get it to write to file.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    vis = o3d.visualization.Visualizer()
    vis.create_window(visible=True)
    vis.add_geometry(pcd)

    vis.run()
    image = np.asarray(vis.capture_screen_float_buffer(do_render=True)).copy()
    vis.destroy_window()
    image *= 255
    image = image.astype(np.uint8)
    cv2.imwrite("image.png", image)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
Should be able to write image to file.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: OSX Mojave
Python version: 3.7.3
Open3D version: 0.7.0.0
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: pip
