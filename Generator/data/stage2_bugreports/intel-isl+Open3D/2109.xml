	<summary>seg fault on all o3d.visualization.draw_geometries calls</summary>

Describe the bug
I built and installed from source to get around some missing method errors. I get farther now but when trying to run an example such as colored_pointcloud_registration I always get a seg fault. It happens in other examples as well.  I tried getting a stack trace but this is all it leaves behind.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/esteimle&gt;@esteimle&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , can you compile in Debug mode to get more information?

		This is probably the same issue as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/2112&gt;#2112&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Don't hesitate to reopen if there is new information, which suggests that this problem is different.

		Got seg fault again on all draw_geometries calls. This only happens when build from source. It won't happen with conda/pip3 install open3d and open3d-python, but conda/pip3 install results in missing packages of TetraMesh when trying to run o3d.geometry.TetraMesh.create_from_point_cloud(pcd).
Tried cmake -DENABLE_GUI=OFF .. in build/ but didn't work.
These happens when trying to run the surface reconstruction demos.
