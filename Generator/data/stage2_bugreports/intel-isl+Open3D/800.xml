	<summary>RANSAC C++ example looping 50,000 times</summary>
	<description>
The &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IntelVCL/Open3D/blob/master/examples/Cpp/RegistrationRANSAC.cpp&gt;RegistrationRANSAC C++ example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is doing some odd looping where it runs the registration 50,000 times.
I assume this was for benchmarking, but it would be nice to have a useful working example that also visualizes the result (maybe an extra commandline option for the visualizer, currently it's forced to false).
