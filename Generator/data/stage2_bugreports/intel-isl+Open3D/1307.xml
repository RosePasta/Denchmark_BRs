ImportError: /lib64/libm.so.6: version 'GLIBC_2.27' not found
When I tried to install Open3D from source on a ppc64le system, I was able to compile and install it using make, but I wasn't able to import it and use it in Python because of a GLIBC issue. It seems that Open3D works for GLIBC versions up to 2.27 but not 2.28, since the GLIBC version is 2.28 on my system.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D
cd Open3D; mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=`which python` -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/ .. 
make -j$(nproc) 
make install-pip-package
python -c "import open3d"

Expected behavior
When I import Open3D in Python, it gives me this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python -c "import open3d"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/home/.conda/envs/test/lib/python3.6/site-packages/open3d/__init__.py", line 35, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .open3d import * # py2 py3 compatible
ImportError: /lib64/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.27' not found (required by /home/.conda/envs/test/lib/python3.6/site-packages/open3d/open3d.cpython-36m-powerpc64le-linux-gnu.so)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment:

OS: CentOS 7,
ppc64le architecture
Python version: 3.6
Open3D version: latest
Is this remote workstation?: yes
How did you install Open3D?: build_from_source

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ ldd --version
ldd (GNU libc) 2.28

$ gcc --version

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Additional context
Additionally, is it possible to provide a conda package that can be used on ppc64le systems? Currently when I try to use conda to install Open3D, it cannot find the package that would work for my system.
When I use conda install -c open3d-admin open3d, it gives me this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - open3d
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Hi @ytyfeng have you solved the bug? I am having the same problem...

Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SarahChane98&gt;@SarahChane98&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Are you using IBMâ€™s ppcle64 system as well?
For me, it was a dynamic linker problem. I used patchelf to link my python binary to the system's ld.so.2 file.

		I met the same question after pip install, and I solved it by specifying a version.
python -m pip install open3d==0.9, and seems 1.0 is not compatible with my system.

		Hello,
I have the same problem. Is there any better solution than downgrading to open3d 0.9? I also read somewhere that upgrading os my help, but neither of these solutions suits me because I am running my program on a cluster.

		What is your GLIBC version?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ldd --version
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Open3D requires GLIBC 2.27.

		Did you build from source? According to the documentation, the latest version requires Ubuntu 18.04+. &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html#system-requirements&gt;http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html#system-requirements&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ytyfeng&gt;@ytyfeng&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, yes this is expected. as mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D#python-quick-start&gt;https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D#python-quick-start&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
Pre-built pip and conda packages support Ubuntu 18.04+, macOS 10.14+ and Windows 10 (64-bit) with Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. If you have other Python versions or operating systems, please compile Open3D from source.
