	<summary>Installing Open3d under Ubuntu 20.04 with pip fails</summary>
	<description>
I cannot install open3d on Ubuntu 20.04 with pip. When I type:
pip3 install open3d I receive:
    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfied the requirement opend3d (from versions: none)    
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for open3d
I'm working with Ubuntu 20.04 as a Windows Subsystem with pip 20.0.2. I can install other packages with pip such as numpy.
Do you have any advice for me how to proceed?
