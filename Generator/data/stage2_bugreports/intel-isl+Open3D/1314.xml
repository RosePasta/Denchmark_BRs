		Did you follow all the steps here? Including installing the azure Kinect
sdk?

 is this because the dll signature has changed?

		<comment id='5' author='stytim' date='2019-12-10T14:45:43Z'>
		I fixed the issue by renaming the Azure SDK folder (literally changed 1.3.0 to 1.2.0). Probably open3d looks for the specific 1.2.0 folder.

		I had similar issue working with 1.3.0 SDK. So I downgraded Kinect SDK to 1.2.0.
Tested both k4a versions with open3d-0.8.0 and . Trying open3d with k4a SDK 1.3 throws  whereras installing SDK 1.2 works fine.
Just for the record, the installers are here: &lt;denchmark-link:http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/9/8/198048e8-63f2-45c6-8f96-1fd541d1b4bc/Azure%20Kinect%20SDK%201.2.0.msi&gt;v1.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Works with k4a SDK 1.2.0. DLL binaries need to be copied to examples/Python/ReconstructionSystem/sensors/ where the python script is.
One issue is that when firmware of sensor has been upgraded with k4a SDK 1.4.0, the sensor no longer works with k4a SDK 1.2.0.

		Fixed this issue by copying k4a.dll, depthengine_2_0.dll, k4arecord.dll from sdk 1.2.0 (C:\Program Files\Azure Kinect SDK v1.2.0\sdk\windows-desktop\amd64\release\bin) to your python location C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\DLLs\  (works with sdk 1.4.0 installed, just copy 1.2.0 dlls to python folder)

		None of the above worked.
Python 3.7
Win 10
Anacoda
Open3D 0.10
PS. The issue occurs only with Kinect Azure SDK 14.0

		I really don't understand why this issue hasn't been taken much seriously. Having faced this issue really many times and in multiple versions, I can see that issue really needs attention and has been here for relatively long time. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/syncle&gt;@syncle&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I can't understand how this is still not solved.. this is not serious .. is this project really seriously maintained ? When I see that I doubt about that.

		Copying the 1.4 dlls to any of the locations suggested before did not work.
However, after I installed 1.2 SDK using the msi installer using the link posted above (I have now all of 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and I think I've upgraded the FW too), the python bindings for the examples in Open3D\examples\python\ReconstructionSystem\sensors started working. No need to copy the dll's anywhere.
However, it'd be great if it would just work with the latest sdk...

		when i work python examples/Python/ReconstructionSystem/sensors/azure_kinect_viewer.py
I can see error "Cannot load k4a.dll"
so I downgraded Kinect SDK to 1.2.0. with @scimad comment. Then it works! azure_kinect_viewer.py is works. and azure_kinect_recorder.py is works.
but after work python examples/Python/ReconstructionSystem/sensors/azure_kinect_mkv_reader.py, I can see error "Cannot load k4arecord.dll"

		On Windows, the Open3D Kinect plugin will look for the Kinect K4A library located in the default installation paths:



Open3D/cpp/open3d/io/sensor/azure_kinect/K4aPlugin.cpp


        Lines 76 to 79
      in
      3c6e664






 "C:\\Program Files\\Azure Kinect SDK v1.4.1\\sdk\\windows-desktop\\amd64\\release\\bin", 



 "C:\\Program Files\\Azure Kinect SDK v1.4.0\\sdk\\windows-desktop\\amd64\\release\\bin", 



 "C:\\Program Files\\Azure Kinect SDK v1.3.0\\sdk\\windows-desktop\\amd64\\release\\bin", 



 "C:\\Program Files\\Azure Kinect SDK v1.2.0\\sdk\\windows-desktop\\amd64\\release\\bin" 





Currently, it supports 1.2.0 to 1.4.1. So first, check if the dll files are are found in the paths above.
If the K4A library is not in the default location, you'll need to set the K4A_LIB_DIR environment variable to point to the directory containing the K4A's *.dll files.
Some of the fixes we have are in the master branch, we'll be updating the python packages in the next release.
