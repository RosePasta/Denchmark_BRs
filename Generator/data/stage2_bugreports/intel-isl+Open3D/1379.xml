	<summary>Read XYZ failed</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
While attempting to read an XYZ file Open3D generates an error. Each line of the input file contains three values separated by commas, e.g., 694386.212,5155487.512,381.036. There are 5000 lines in the file. File attached below.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

import open3d as o3d
pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud('test.txt',format='xyz')
See error: [Open3D WARNING] Read XYZ failed: unable to open file: test.txt

Expected behavior
Expected point cloud to be read into pcd.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: OSX Mojave 10.14.6
Python version: 3.6.9
Open3D version: 0.8.0.0
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: conda install -c open3d-admin open3d

		The error indicates, that you might have specified the wrong path to the file.
Further, xyz expects that the values are separated by one space, not commas.

		After changing the delimiter to spaces the error goes away (can you state the space delimiter requirement in the documentation?), but the dataset does not plot properly with o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd]). It appears only as a small read square (attached above).

		Might be this problem: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/1197&gt;#1197&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Should be gone, if you compile the source from the master branch.

 tall me that each line contains [x, y, z], where x, y, z are the 3D coordinates of read format xyz. The separator I understand is "," but it's actually a space. Is it necessary to modify hereï¼Ÿ

		Yes, indeed, documentation is confusing in this regard. My assumption was as well that delimiter is comma not single space. Please update documentation or make it. Another suggestion, make header "skipable" not only for pts format. Thnaks!

		Please update the documentation and provide an example that shows the spacing. Thanks.
