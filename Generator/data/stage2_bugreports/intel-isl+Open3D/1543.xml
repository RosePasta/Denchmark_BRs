	<description>
Describe the bug
I have a test of RegistrationRANSAC, which is a example of c++ and use the Testdata. But in running, it take an error like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

after debug, I find the API registration::ComputeFPFHFeature will cause this error. further more, I use python API run sample example, but it work well.
Expected behavior
why the C++ API will raise error , but python API work well, how can i do could let it work and take same  result finial.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 18.04

Is this remote workstation?: yes
