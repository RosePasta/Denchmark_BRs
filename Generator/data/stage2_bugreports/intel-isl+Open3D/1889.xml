	<summary>Python crashes when displaying a textured mesh imported from OBJ file</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Python crashed without any error message when displaying a texture mesh.
To Reproduce
This is the short script to reproduce the issue:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import open3d as o3d
mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("Chorthippus_neu.obj")
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([mesh])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Python crashed and exited after the 3rd line of code. The OBJ file is available in a zip file at &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X4tCISTG19ngW_9KbMU_m1IKCgv7j918&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X4tCISTG19ngW_9KbMU_m1IKCgv7j918&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Expected behavior
Should display a textured mesh without issue. Or at least display an error message.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit
Python version: Python 3.7.3
Open3D version: 0.10.0.1
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: pip in conda command window

Additional context
Meshlab opened and displayed the textured mesh without problem.

		This bug seems fixed in the master branch in terms of model loading. However, it seems that the texture is not loaded/visualized. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/errissa&gt;@errissa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please take a look since it is now using ?
