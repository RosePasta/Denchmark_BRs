	<summary>Question - Headless rendering with textured mesh</summary>
	<description>
Hello, thanks for great work.
I have a question about the headless rendering.
I have tried to use headless rendering with textured mesh, but it didn't work.
I used the example code (headless_rendering.py) which the input data was changed
(point cloud -&gt; textured mesh).
As a result, the segmentation fault is raised after the line "vis.run()" (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/179dcd2190c1342aabee8cdbadaae784d03b7199/examples/Python/Advanced/headless_rendering.py#L59&gt;headless_rendering-line59&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
[mesh info]
geometry:: TriangleMesh with 49998 points and 1000004 triangles,
and textures of size (8192, 8192)
This textured mesh could be rendered with default rendering.
Can't headless rendering work with textured mesh?

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jbjeong&gt;@jbjeong&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I got the same issue with headless rendering for textured mesh. Any update for this? Thanks!

		I'm also struggling with textured meshes. Apparently, there was some regression at some point. Some time ago there was an example loading the crate.obj object under the test_data dir. Now if you try to load with the original visualizer it doesn't work anymore. With the new visualizer, it does work
EDIT: I've found a regression (probably when the ASSIMP library was added). I usually use the master branch for Open3D. The master branch is not properly rendering textures, but the version from pip it's indeed(latest release)
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Old Visualizer master-branch&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Old Visualizer *from pip package&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;New Visualizer&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
