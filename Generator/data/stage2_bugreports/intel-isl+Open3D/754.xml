	<summary>In python, create_window() has a "left" and "right" parameter.  should be "left" and "top"?</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
If I want to create_window() in a specific position, there are two parameters:  "left" and "right".  The "right" parameter seems to control the up-down position.  Should this be renamed to "top"?  (The behavior is correct, just the argname is confusing.)
Desktop (please complete the following information):
Ubuntu 16.04.  Intel i5-8400, 32 GB ram.  GeForce-GTX-1080
