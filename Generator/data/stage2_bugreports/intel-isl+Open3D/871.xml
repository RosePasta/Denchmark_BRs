	<summary>Visualizer gets stuck on key callback</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
VisualizerWithKeyCallback does not call my callback when I press the key, and stops responding to any input.
To Reproduce

Load geometry
Run the custom_draw_geometry_with_key_callback function (from here) on it.
Press the K key
The window freezes, and no change happens.

Expected behavior
The background color changes to black, and the visualizer keeps running.
Screenshots

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: OSX High Sierra 10.13.6
Python version: 3.7.2

Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: pip

Additional context
This issue occurs with any uses of VisualizerWithKeyCallback, whether via draw_geometries_with_key_callbacks, or creating the class myself and running the rendering loop myself.

		Could you provide us a minimum code example? I will close this in the meantime.
