	<summary>Number of edge not showing up in Global Optimization using Gauss-Newton</summary>
	<description>
While using o3d.registration.GlobalOptimizationGaussNewton() as method for o3d.registration.global_optimization(), I noticed that the number of edges in verbose was missing as shown below.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[Open3D DEBUG] Validating PoseGraph - finished.
[Open3D DEBUG] [GlobalOptimizationGaussNewton] Optimizing PoseGraph having 4 nodes and %d edges. 
[Open3D DEBUG] Line process weight : 35.426347
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Things are okay while using o3d.registration.GlobalOptimizationLevenbergMarquardt() method.
Environment:

OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.8
Open3D version: v0.8.0.
Compiled &amp; Installed from source
