		Seems like an issue with the latest build (from last month)
Installing an older version fixed the issue
pip install open3d==0.8.0

 you can also build from source to get version 0.9.
The issue of the default pip installation of 0.9 not working on OSX 10.13 and 10.14 still needs to be fixed.

		It seems this issue is not just restricted to OSX ...
I am on Win10 64b, trying to use version 0.9.0 from a virtualenv gives me:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:/Users/.../kinect-trials/load_pickle-3d.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    import open3d as o3d
  File "C:\...\kinect-trials\.venv\lib\site-packages\open3d\__init__.py", line 35, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .open3d import * # py2 py3 compatible
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

version 0.8.0 does not have this issue

		Please check &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/1487#issuecomment-592416175&gt;discussions in here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. In short, the reported issue is not reproducible with up-to-date python env and open3d package. Closing issue.

		Hi syncle, I don't see anything in that thread about OSX 10.14.
I updated to the latest version of python (3.6.5 to 3.8.2) and now I am getting this error when installing with pip:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement open3d (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for open3d
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can you please elaborate how to get Open3D working in OSX or explain what your solution is. Thank you.

		Using OSX 10.14.6:
conda install -c open3d-admin open3d
produces the same error:
File "", line 1, in

No idea how to fix it! It should not be a closing issue!
