	<summary>Textured OBJs render without the texture.</summary>

Describe the bug
Textures for .OBJ files not rendering:
To Reproduce

Download the example obj, mtl, jpg from http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/obj/minobj.html
Run this code:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mesh = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("capsule.obj", print_progress=True)
mesh.compute_vertex_normals()
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([mesh])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
A textured mesh.

I only get an untextured mesh:

Not console errors, and all files are in the root with the python script.
I have tried other OBJ files with textures too and can't get any to work with the texture.
Environment (please complete the following information):
Python3, Mac OSX (Catalina), Open3D 0.8

		Did you compile from source? Open3D 0.8 does not include the ability to handle textured mesh, this was added later.

		No, what's the best way to get the latest version in Python?

		Works when built from source:
