	<summary>Please don't install empty directories</summary>
	<description>
You install these two empty directories:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;include/Open3D/IO/FileFormat
include/Open3D/Visualization/Shader/GLSL
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Could you please remove them? They are redundant.
Thanks!

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yurivict&gt;@yurivict&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for pointing out this issue. Could you help to fix this? I think you can exclude these folders by modifying src/IO/CMakeLists.txt and src/Visualization/CMakeLists.txt.
For example, you can exclude the  by modifying the following lines.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#src/IO/CMakeLists.txt
install(DIRECTORY   "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
        DESTINATION "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}"
        PATTERN     "*.cpp" EXCLUDE
        PATTERN     "*.txt" EXCLUDE)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
