	<summary>Cannot change background color with vis-gui.py example</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I'm trying to use the new GUI module for point cloud visualizations, but am having trouble with changing the background color. In the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/examples/python/GUI/vis-gui.py&gt;vis-gui.py example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I cannot get the background color to change at all despite selecting a new background color with the "BG Color" color picker.
I have also tried hard-coding line 135 of vis-gui.py to choose a different initial background color, which does not work either.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
I built open3d from source today (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/commit/e3f0edb65770baeb6a08225c257b124764af4e87&gt;e3f0edb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and ran the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/examples/python/GUI/vis-gui.py&gt;vis-gui.py example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with a pcd file and tried to change the background color with the "BG Color" color picker.
Expected behavior
Expected the background color to change.

		I think this was caused by moving to Filament 1.8 from 1.4.5, which changed how the background color is set, and the example didn't get updated. Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/pull/2299&gt;#2299&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cygann&gt;@cygann&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I am trying to run vis-gui.py file. I am getting a module not found error for open3d.visualization.gui. Did you get any errors while running this py file? If so how did you solve it? I compiled the code from the source code.
