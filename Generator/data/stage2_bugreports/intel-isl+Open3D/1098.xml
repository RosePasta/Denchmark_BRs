	<summary>Files with Unicode path are not read</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
(This may only apply to Windows 10) I'm trying to read a PCD file using open3d.io.read_point_cloud. The operation yields the correct result if the path to the file is in ASCII, but for paths that include Unicode characters the read operation returns an empty object.
os.path.isfile() returns true for the file including Unicode, and I use the same path for other operations without issue. I think it must be related to how Open3D handles the path internally.
To Reproduce

Create a Unicode folder ("出典データ" for me)
Try reading the file using read_point_cloud

Expected behavior
Read the file from any valid location.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Win 10 Pro
Python version: 3.7.3
Open3D version: 0.7.0
Is this remote workstation? no
How did you install Open3D? conda

		Yes, seems to be related to Windows and . Cf. &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/396567/is-there-a-standard-way-to-do-an-fopen-with-a-unicode-string-file-path&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/396567/is-there-a-standard-way-to-do-an-fopen-with-a-unicode-string-file-path&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Not sure what the best way is to handle this. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yxlao&gt;@yxlao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
