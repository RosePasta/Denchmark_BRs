	<summary>open3d.open3d.geometry.PointCloud has no "voxel_down_sample" method</summary>
	<description>
IMPORTANT: Please use the following template to report the bug.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the bug
Tried to run example /examples/Python/Advanced/pointcloud_outlier_removal.py using open3d 0.7.0.0, which installed via conda.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

cd ./examples/Python/Advanced/
python pointcloud_outlier_removal.py
after closing the first visualization, the program breaks and the error is:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Load a ply point cloud, print it, and render it
Downsample the point cloud with a voxel of 0.02
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "pointcloud_outlier_removal.py", line 27, in &lt;module&gt;
    voxel_down_pcd = pcd.voxel_down_sample(voxel_size=0.02)
AttributeError: 'open3d.open3d.geometry.PointCloud' object has no attribute 'voxel_down_sample'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
open3d.open3d.geometry.PointCloud has no "voxel_down_sample" method
Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS:Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: Python 3.6.5
Open3D version: '0.7.0.0'
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: conda, conda install -c open3d-admin open3d

		The problem is, that the online documentation is connected to the master branch and not the latest tag. Had a few of these issues lately. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yxlao&gt;@yxlao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you look into this as discussed on discord?

		I experience the same error () for the &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.open3d.org/docs/tutorial/Advanced/global_registration.html&gt;global_registration example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Open3D version: 0.7.0.0
Python version: 3.6.7
Not a remote workstation
Installed Open3D with pip: pip3 install open3d-python
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/griegler&gt;@griegler&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is it possible to look up documentation online for the latest tag somewhere? Would love to try a working example!

 not yet, unfortunately. The scripts in  are set-up to build always the latest version in the master branch. It is on our list. Until then, you could either build the latest open3d from source, or the documentation by running  in the  folder (after checking out the tagged version).

		I also did experience the same error while performing one of my first tests, namely:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://www.open3d.org/docs/tutorial/Basic/pointcloud.html&gt;http://www.open3d.org/docs/tutorial/Basic/pointcloud.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Which gives me the following error:

AttributeError: 'open3d.open3d.geometry.PointCloud' object has no attribute 'voxel_down_sample'

OS: Windows 10
Open3D version: 0.7.0.0
Python version: 3.7.3
Not a remote workstation
Installed Open3D by compiling from source
Can anyone explain/inform me how to perform such a basic operation?
Thanks in advance.

		Look at the code here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/v0.7.0/examples/Python/Basic/pointcloud.py&gt;https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/v0.7.0/examples/Python/Basic/pointcloud.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Again, the online doc shows unfortunately the master branch and not the latest released version.

 does anybody work on that issue?

		I had faced the same issue. Currently I'm using
from open3d.open3d.geometry import voxel_down_sample,estimate_normals
as a work around

Hi,
I tried your strategy and when calling "voxel_down_sample(pcd)" it shows error " voxel_down_sample(): incompatible function arguments." Do you have the similar issue before? Thanks!

You need to give voxel_size as an argument as well, as you are down sampling. So the function template becomes "voxel_down_sample(pcd,voxel_size)" . Hope this helps!

		In case anyone is running into this by way of google, the version being referenced above is now in pypi so before you try any complicated measures, try updating your package using pip3 first.

		This can also be due to multiple versions of open3D associated with your interpreter.
See what version is installed : 
Try pip3 uninstall open3D and see what version was uninstalled.
If the python can still import open3d after un-installation, you have another version installed! Sometimes this can be open3d-python so you can remove this by pip3 uninstall open3d-python.
This should completely remove all the open3d versions. See this link for more information: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/pull/1055#issue-293960190&gt;#1055 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you very much. You've been very helpful.
