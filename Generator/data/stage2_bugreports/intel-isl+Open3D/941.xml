	<summary>Voxel visualization seems to fail with version 0.6.0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the bug
I failed to visualize the voxels with version 0.6.0 on my ubuntu PC, both py=3.5/3.7 (and at another machine). Turned to 0.5.0 works like a charm.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from open3d import read_voxel_grid, draw_geometries
# https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/raw/master/examples/TestData/bathtub_0154_voxel.ply
voxel_read = read_voxel_grid("bathtub_0154_voxel.ply")
print(voxel_read)
draw_geometries([voxel_read])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Reading PLY: [========================================] 100%
VoxelGrid with 18733 voxels.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And there should be views, but not the case for 0.6.0
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: [Ubuntu 16.04]
Python version: 3.7.1/3.5.6
Open3D version: 0.6.0
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?:  both pip [AND] conda

Additional context
I am not so sure whether this is only me or not, but limited tests seem chances are that you may accidentally miss something when building the new version. Correct me if I am wrong.
And, thanks for the wonderful lib ^_^

		Thanks for reporting, this is related to updated OpenGL version -- OpenGL 3.1+ removed GL_QUADS support, thus our previous SimpleShaderForVoxelGrid is broken.
This has been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/pull/918&gt;#918&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, please compile from source to get this update now. It will be included in the 0.7 release.
