	<summary>Incorrect voxel_down_sample usage in tutorial</summary>
	<description>
IMPORTANT: Please use the following template to report the bug.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the bug
The following line in the PointCloud tutorial does not work. 'geometry' package does not have any method called 'voxel_down_sample'
downpcd = o3d.geometry.voxel_down_sample(pcd, voxel_size=0.05)
To Reproduce
Run the following lines of code
pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("../../TestData/fragment.pcd")
downpcd = o3d.geometry.voxel_down_sample(pcd, voxel_size=0.05)
Expected behavior
I expect the tutorial to show the right method to call for down sampling
Environment (please complete the following information):
Any OS
Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.

		What version of open3d are you using?
Can you post the result of o3d.__version__ , because it is working for me in version 0.7.

		The output of o3d.version is '0.7.0.0'. I am able to use other methods say in visualization, io etc as shown in the documentation. I am seeing trouble in geometry methods such as 'estimate_normals', 'voxel_down_sample'

		I see. You were looking at the wrong documentation then. For the documentation related to the master branch look at &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/Basic/pointcloud.html&gt;latest&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
