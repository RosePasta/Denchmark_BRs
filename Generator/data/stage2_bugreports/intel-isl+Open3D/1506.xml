	<summary>Select_down_sample blocks update_geometry</summary>
	<description>
IMPORTANT: Please use the following template to report the bug.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the bug
Using select_down_sample gets you a downsampled pointcloud. However, this pointcloud does not work with the visualizer. calls to visualizer.update_geometry(downsampled_pcd) do not have any effect; only the initial pointcloud is shown in the visualizer.
To Reproduce
`    downsampled_pcd = pcd.select_down_sample(plane_idxs, invert=True)
while True:
vis.update_geometry(downsampled_pcd)
`
Expected behavior
The visualizer should show the latest pointcloud.
Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
Environment (please complete the following information):

		down_sample will decrease no of points in cloud and its working fine
refer doc here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/pull/1287&gt;#1287&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

maybe you are trying to zoom_out point cloud for that refer &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/828&gt;#828&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 use ctr.scale for zoom_out

		The problem seems to be that select_down_sample produces a new PointCloud. So, visualizer does not have a reference to it and can not update it (Given that you called add_geometry with pcd, not with downsampled_pcd).
To make update_geometry work, you will need to call add_geometry with downsampled_pcd.
