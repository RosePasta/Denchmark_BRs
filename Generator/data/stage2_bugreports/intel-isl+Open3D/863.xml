		I would argue with is not a bug but an undefined behavior - although point to plane ICP does inform the user about the lack of normals...

		When running colored ICP in a Jupyter notebook if normals aren't given then a warning is printed in the Jupyter log and the kernel dies rather than an exception being raised.
