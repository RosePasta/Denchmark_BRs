	<summary>Window cannot be closed during non-blocking visualization in Python</summary>
	<description>
When running the non_blocking_visualization.py example in Python, it is not possible to close the window during the process by clicking the x button in the top right corner. Is there a way to get around that issue?
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run non_blocking_visualization.py
Try to close the window

Expected behavior
I expected the currently open window to close.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows 10
Python version: 3.7.5
Open3D version: 0.8.0
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: pip

		I am facing a similar problem. Is there any way to check whether the window has been closed while the loop for non-blocking visualization is running?
Thanks

		I solved the problem by putting poll_events() in an if clause like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if not vis.poll_events():
    break
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
