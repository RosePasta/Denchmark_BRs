		Could you share the cmake config flag?

		actually, since I was struggling and time was important to me, I downgraded to ubuntu 18.04, but I tried lots of things, for example, set up these flags: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/filament/issues/2146&gt;google/filament#2146&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		and likewise here. Let me know if you need any build logs or other info. I'm building from source, in a Ubuntu 20.04 docker container.

		I experienced the same issue (Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8. Open3d 0.10, gcc-9) but similarly to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/2094&gt;#2094&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I was able to solve it by manually installing filament from source and adding the paths to the CMakeLists in Open3d (Variables FILAMENT_PRECOMPILED_ROOT and FILAMENT_SOURCE_ROOT).
For filament, I followed the instructions from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/filament/blob/main/BUILDING.md#linux&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 using their dependencies (clang-10, ninja, etc.) and compiled it without java bindings.

		I also had this issue and the solution is as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/femust&gt;@femust&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  pointed out to the filament issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/filament/issues/2146&gt;google/filament#2146&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Actually filament needs to be compiled with builtin functions disabled () (i am attaching a patch for that), then Open3D needs to be build with .

 I tried your solution and successfully compile filament separately and passed its part but got stuck below when compiling Open3D  with 
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- Installing: /media/ngu10t/DATA1/repos/Open3D/build/assimp/include/assimp/Compiler/pushpack1.h
-- Installing: /media/ngu10t/DATA1/repos/Open3D/build/assimp/include/assimp/Compiler/poppack1.h

[ 21%] Completed 'ext_assimp'
[ 21%] Built target ext_assimp
make: *** [Makefile:130: all] Error 2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Could you please provide more details of your solution? Thanks.

 I tried your patch/solution but same error reported at the beginning of this thread still occurred. Could you provide a complete reproducible steps? Thanks.
My system is also Ubuntu  20.04 .
