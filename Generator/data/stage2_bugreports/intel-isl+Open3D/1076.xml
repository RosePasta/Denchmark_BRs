	<summary>Geometry.PointCloud has no attribute 'rotate' or 'scale'</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I used pip to install Open3D in my environment and when I try to use the "rotate" or "scale" members of geometry.PointCloud I got an error that this class doesn't have these attributes even though I saw they are present in the documentation. Are these functions considered work in progress or did I install the package incorrectly ?
In advance, thank you for your answer.

		If you have installed the latest version via pip, then rotate and scale should be available for the PointCloud objects. What is the output of import open3d as o3d; print(o3d.__version__)?

		That's the problem then. Can you try to reinstall open3d via pip again and test the version. It should be 0.7.0.0 to access the above mentioned methods.
