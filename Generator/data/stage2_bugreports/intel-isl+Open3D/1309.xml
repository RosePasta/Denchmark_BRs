	<summary>Load ply file and draw_geometries</summary>

IMPORTANT: Please use the following template to report the bug.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the bug
I updated the recent version of open3d (0.8.0.0) and ran my code, but it cannot properly visualize it. I guess it is camera setting issue. The previous version of the open3d successfully visualized.
In the screen shot, as you can see, there is one gray dot. It indicates that there is point cloud, but looks like the camera location is not correct I guess.
*Here is my code
import open3d as o3d
UAS_pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("./UAS_point_cloud/odm_georeferenced_model_2D.ply")
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([UAS_pcd])

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: [e.g. OSX Mojave, Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 10.0]
Python version:
Open3D version: 0.8
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: pip

**Additional comment
The example code fragment.ply works.

		Could you verify if it works with the latest source in the master branch? If not, would it be possible to share the ply file, so we could see what the issue might be?

		You saying is that I need to build the package using the latest source, right? I haven't done this procedure. I am currently figuring out based on Open3D instruction. I will let you know soon. If I cannot figure it out, I will share my ply file so that you can see the new update code is working properly.

		I am struggling to install from the master source file. When I did the
following message, I got an error message. ( I could not figure it out)

 cmake
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/youngjun/PycharmProjects/BIM-Wemarathon/BIM_python/lib/python3.6/site-packages/open3d
..

How can I share my ply file? through email?

		What is the error message?
You could upload the ply file anywhere and post the link, or send it to me via mail.

		Works for me with the code from the current master branch:

I can also confirm that it is not working with . Regarding the cmake error: It seems that you are missing some headers. Did you have a look &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html#windows&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		I figured it out. There was a dependency issue. I resolved by
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
Thanks for your helps.
