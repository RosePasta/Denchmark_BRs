	<summary>Unable to convert PCD to PLY</summary>
	<description>
I'm using the following code to convert PCD file to PLY.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import open3d as o3d


print("Testing IO for point cloud ...")
pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("pointcloud.pcd")
print(pcd)
o3d.io.write_point_cloud("copy_of_fragment.ply", pcd)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Unfortunately the converted Pointcloud looks messy in blender. Is this the proper way of doing it?

		This is the correct way. Can you please provide the ply file (or a similar one) that produces the problem. It would also be good to show screenshots of loading the ply and the pcd in Blender.
