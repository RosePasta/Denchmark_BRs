	<summary>Wrong self intersecting triangle mesh</summary>
	<description>
Related Bug: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/1171&gt;#1171&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After doing some testing on the merged fix.
What was fixed is the overall detection of the intersection (is_intersecting), but when there are intersections the intersecting triangles returned are wrong.
For example for a mesh of 26306 triangles with a very small area of intersection we get a vector of 137714 intersections.

		I think that might be a problem with this particular mesh. It seems that this is a triangle soup, not a triangle mesh, i.e. no face is connected with another face. But they are still touching on the boundaries, hence you get all the intersections. You can compare also with the result from e.g., MeshLab.

		I see thanks for the input.
Can you tell when this patch will be pushed to pip? And whether we can use it wit a GPU?

		The patch will be included in the next release, which I think will only be in two months or so. There are ongoing works for GPU support, but I can not give an estimate now when this exact feature will have full support.
