		Can you try downloading from &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/open3d/#files&gt;https://pypi.org/project/open3d/#files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the corresponding version and install with pip directly? One possibility is the mismatch of virtualenv's python version with pip, or maybe the python distribution is 32 bit.
We have support for 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 on Windows 64 bit.

		tried to install whl from &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/open3d/#files&gt;https://pypi.org/project/open3d/#files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on Windows 10 x64, Python 3.8:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;pip install open3d-0.9.0.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
ERROR: open3d-0.9.0.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

&gt;pip -V
pip 20.0.2 from c:\program files\python38\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)

&gt;python -V
Python 3.8.1

&gt;ver
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.805]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

is this because I use Python 3.8 (not 3.7), or some other reason?

		I installed 3.8.2 earlier today and had the same issue.
After installing 3.7.7 and removing 3.8.2, it worked for me.

		Would it be possible for developers to compile .whl file also for 3.8? Library itself should be compatible, they only need to add Python 3.8 to Metadata file...?

		Thank you all for the comments and help. It seems my Python version was 32-bit. I reinstalled the 64-bit version and it seems to work fine now. Still on Python 3.7.7 as well.
