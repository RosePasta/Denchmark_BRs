	<summary>Estimate_normals() is not translation invariant?</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When apply a translation to a point cloud, the results of estimate_normals are slightly different.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

follow the tutorial page: http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/Basic/pointcloud.html
add a translation to the point cloud
calculate the difference of estimated normals (to avoid sign ambiguity, normals are taken absolute value)

Expected behavior
If I understand correctly, normal vectors are a local property and should not change after moving the point cloud to another position.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04
Python version: Python 3.7
Open3D version: 0.9
How did you install Open3D?: conda

 could you provide a minimum reproducible example that shows the problem. Thanks!

		It turns out to be an issue of normal direction. For the same point cloud, the direction of estimated normal flips randomly. I am closing the issue as it is not a bug of your code.
