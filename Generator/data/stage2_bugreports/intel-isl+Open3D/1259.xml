	<summary>[Open3D WARNING] Read OBJ failed: Material file not found.</summary>
	<description>
When I tried to use read_triangle_mesh to read a mesh files in obj format, I met a mistake.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; import open3d as o3d
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = o3d.io.read_triangle_mesh("/home/user/data_3d/A.obj",print_progress = True)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the error liked this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[Open3D WARNING] Read OBJ failed: Material file [ A.mtl ] not found.
Failed to load material file(s). Use default material.

Segmentation fault

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and python console exited.
The error says there isn't a mtl file.
But A.mtl, A.obj and A.jpg are all in data_3d directory and I can open this obj object using Meshlab .
Environment:

OS:  Ubuntu 18.04.3
Python version:3.7.3
Open3D version:0.8.0.0
Is this remote workstation?: yes
How did you install Open3D?:
the open3d installed using pip or conda or build_from_source all had these problem.

		Can you please shared the files? There might be a problem in file parsing.

		Ah, sorry, this feature was not included in 0.8.0.0. It should have been supported in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/pull/1194&gt;#1194&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. You may compile from the source, or wait for the next release with official support.

Hi, I have downloaded the source code using code 'git clone --recursive &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D&gt;https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
' today and compile from this source. But the problem is still exist...
Is there any other method to deal with this problem?
looking forward to your early reply.

		I met the same problem. I think it is a bug that the function looks for .mtl file in the current working directory rather than the directory where .obj file is located. Please fix. Thanks. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/theNded&gt;@theNded&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 if i set the .mtl file in the current working directory, it still doesn't work and no error is printed.

 Sorry for the late reply, did you install via ? Otherwise you would be still using the 0.8.0.0 version.
Can you please try the provided example in the repo? It should be able to load a textured cube if Open3D is up-to-date.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/examples/Python/Basic/visualization.py&gt;https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/examples/Python/Basic/visualization.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shiyoung77&gt;@shiyoung77&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: it searches the obj file's parent directly, i.e., the directory where .obj file is located. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/src/Open3D/IO/FileFormat/FileOBJ.cpp#L51&gt;https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/blob/master/src/Open3D/IO/FileFormat/FileOBJ.cpp#L51&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kaixin-bai&gt;@kaixin-bai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please try the same and see if the lateset version is installed?

		Has this feature been available in the 0.10.0.0 version? Currently, I still met the problem that the textures are not loaded correctly. Could anyone help?

 Would you please share any error messages you see on the console when you try to load the model? Also, if you can share the model. that would be helpful as well.

 I am having a similar problem as well check my message &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/1484#issuecomment-687173998&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, not sure whether it is material file related or not but you can find the model attached.
Not sure what is the issue though.
