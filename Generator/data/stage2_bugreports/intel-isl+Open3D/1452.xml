		I am having the same issue. I tried on python 2.7 and 3.7 with VSCode and both had same issue. I can successfully use open3d-python 0.7.0.0 but cannot use the latest ver.

		Install open3d instead of open3d-python. I tested Open3D 0.9.0 pip and Conda installation under Windows 10 64-bit with python3.7 and they're all working for me.
Here's the full terminal recording for pip install:

Here's the full terminal recording for conda install:

Please try with the exact same command (including creating a fresh environment and activating it), and see if the problem still exists. Please feel free to reopen the issue.
