	<summary>create_point_cloud_from_rgbd_image failed</summary>
	<description>
I use "create_point_cloud_from_rgbd_image(rgbd_image, PinholeCameraIntrinsic.get_prime_sense_default())"  to create cloud point from RGBD data, and I got the following error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "rgbd_redwood.py", line 25, in 
PinholeCameraIntrinsic.get_prime_sense_default())
TypeError: unbound method get_prime_sense_default() must be called with PinholeCameraIntrinsic instance as first argument (got nothing instead).
I got the same error when run it's demo "rgbd_redwood.py".
Here is what I tried
I changed  "PinholeCameraIntrinsic.get_prime_sense_default()" to "PinholeCameraIntrinsic().get_prime_sense_default()" , then I got Invoked with: PinholeCameraIntrinsic with width = -1 and height = -1.
I read the code,
const PinholeCameraIntrinsic PinholeCameraIntrinsic::GetPrimeSenseDefault()
{
return PinholeCameraIntrinsic(640, 480, 525.0, 525.0, 319.5, 239.5);
}
I did not really get what's is going on here?
I was using the newest master branch, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/commit/03ee3e49e13028511ab9f7cc1d866e009cbaf5bd&gt;03ee3e4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and the lib was compiled from source on Ubuntu 14.04 with python 2.7.14.

		I workout with    pcd = create_point_cloud_from_rgbd_image(rgbd_image,
PinholeCameraIntrinsic(640, 480, 525.0, 525.0, 319.5, 239.5)).
Then here I got another problem, the cloud points are in gray, which I think should be colored.
Change "create_point_cloud_from_rgbd_image(rgbd_image, PinholeCameraIntrinsic.get_prime_sense_default())" to "create_point_cloud_from_rgbd_image(rgbd_image,
PinholeCameraIntrinsic(640, 480, 525.0, 525.0, 319.5, 239.5))" in  rgbd_redwood.py, then you will reproduce the problem.

the cloud points are in gray, which I think should be colored.

Create rgbd_image with convert_rgb_to_intensity = False, for example.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    rgbd_image = create_rgbd_image_from_color_and_depth(
        color_raw, depth_raw, convert_rgb_to_intensity = False);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It will show colored point cloud.

TypeError: unbound method get_prime_sense_default() must be called with PinholeCameraIntrinsic instance as first argument (got nothing instead).

Let me check on this.

		I found why this happens. It happens Python 2.7, not 3.6. In Python 2.7, returned class from GetPrimeSenseDefault() is not a class instance. I replaced it with static variable. I pushed a new PR for fixing this issue.

		Good catch. I didn't know Python2.7 and Python3.x can have different behaviors on this.
