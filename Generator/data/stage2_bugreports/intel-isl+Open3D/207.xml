	<summary>Flipped color for some PCD files</summary>
	<description>
Hi Authors,
When I tried to open some PCD files using draw_geometries function, color of some pointclouds was flipped (seems like from RGB to BGR), while some were not.
The differences I can find among these PCD files are mainly following:
1/ Organized data (original color) and unorganized (flipped color);
2/ 'DATA' type is hex (original color) and ascii (flipped color).
FYI: two PCD files are attached.

Thanks!

		We had this issue before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/45&gt;#45&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I need to collect more cases to debug.
I see the shared file has

organized_hex.pcd (looks good)
unorganized_ascii.pcd. (BGR)

Can you also generate either two cases?

unorganized_binary.pcd
organized_ascii.pcd

I am suspicious about color decoding for ascii format. If it is the case, you can fix it by changing RGB channel order in following function and create PR for this.

		I've tested both

unorganized_binary.pcd (looks good)
organized_ascii.pcd (flipped color, something like BGR)

I found that ascii format PCD files all had this color bug, whether they were organized or unorganized.
I modified your mentioned function in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IntelVCL/Open3D/blob/53fe62d1a8574a581a5b71c7999759bf3be50262/src/IO/FileFormat/FilePCD.cpp#L311-L332&gt;Open3D/src/IO/FileFormat/FilePCD.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and rebuilt it, now it looks good for those ascii format PCD files.
I have created PR for this.
Thanks.
