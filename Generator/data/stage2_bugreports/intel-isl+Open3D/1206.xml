	<summary>Maybe-uninitialized tetramesh.cpp</summary>
	<description>
While installing Open3D I get the following error message about the tetramesh.cpp file
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55833726/65676992-19b86b00-e051-11e9-803c-206ae5f11e72.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I try to build Open3D 0.8.0 from source on Ubuntu 16.04 with python 3.6.3
I can get around this problem by removing -Werror in the CMakeLists.txt, but this is of course only a temporary solution. So does anyone know how to fix this issue.

 Can it happen that  is uninitialized here?

		The code is the same as the one you show. However it could be that order does not have values, when all the if statements are skipped.

		It should never happen that all branches are skipped if the tetrahedron is sane.
I will check if it is better to remove the last "else if" or to add an else branch.
