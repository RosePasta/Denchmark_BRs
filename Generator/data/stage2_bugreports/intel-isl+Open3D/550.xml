	<summary>Incorrect default install location on linux</summary>
	<description>

The default value for  is set to , but according to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/command/find_package.html?highlight=i&gt;cmake docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, that is not one of the default search locations for , so other packages that depend on Open3D can't find it without explicitly giving the install location. Changing  to  (lower case cmake) fixes this.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Make and install Open3D using the provided instructions. Then create a new package that depends on Open3D, and try to find it in cmake using find_package(Open3D REQUIRED)
Expected behavior
CMake should find Open3D at it's default install location
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit
Open3D version:  commit d356cfe
