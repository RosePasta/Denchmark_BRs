	<summary>Read PTS failed: unable to read header</summary>
	<description>
When I tried to load .pts files, it failed and post
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[Open3D WARNING] Read PTS failed: unable to read header.
geometry::PointCloud with 0 points.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My code is as follows:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import open3d as o3d
import os

if __name__ == "__main__":

    print("Load a pts point cloud, print it, and render it")
    path_name = r'D:\data\shapenetcore_partanno_segmentation_benchmark_v0\02691156\points'
    file_name = '1a32f10b20170883663e90eaf6b4ca52.pts'
    pf = os.path.join(path_name, file_name)
    pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud(pf)
    print(pcd)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Could you help me with this?
Thank you very much!

		Hard to tell what the problem is without seeing the file. Could you provide it?

		Yes. The .ptx file can not be attached here. Could you download it from here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fwO_KIXvUpyniny4_7ntVoy3uTLeOxvf&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fwO_KIXvUpyniny4_7ntVoy3uTLeOxvf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you very much.

		I succeeded with np.loadtxt. I think you can include this case that the .ptx file has no header into the package open3d.

Could you tell how to include this case?
