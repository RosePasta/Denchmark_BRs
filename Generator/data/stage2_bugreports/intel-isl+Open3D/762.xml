	<summary>ConvertFromPinholeCameraParameters failed in the example tutorial</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Can not run customized_visualization.py in examples when I pull the official repo. Having warnings [ViewControl] ConvertFromPinholeCameraParameters() failed because window height and width do not match.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

pull the official repo
Go to examples\Python\Advanced
run git bash in this folder
Run python customized_visualization.py

Expected behavior
When reach
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print("6. Customized visualization playing a camera trajectory")
custom_draw_geometry_with_camera_trajectory(pcd)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It must do as the tutorial shows to capture images along a trajectory, but the view change is failed
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: win10
Python: 3.6.5

		I have got the same output when I tried it.

		Umm I just tried with win10, but couldn't reproduce the issue. Can you double check that the pip package was built from source?

		No, I got the same results. Maybe I miss some steps? Here are my steps to get the library:

clone the repo
use cmake to generate sln files. Cmake do find the path of the python executable
open the sln file and build the all_build project, then right click the install-pip-package and build it

get into the example/advanced folder and run python .\customized_visualization.py

After that, I still failed to get view change in the 6th test case.
How can I check the version of my open3d, in the __init__.py, the version number is 0.4.0.0

		<comment id='4' author='whatseven' date='2019-01-03T17:53:48Z'>
		Umm I am still trying to figure out what makes the issue.
Try 1.  Install Open3D Python using command line.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip uninstall open3d-python
cmake --build . --config Release --target install-pip-package
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Try 2. ConvertFromPinholeCameraParameters() failed because window height and width do not match. message appears if the generated window size cannot reproduce the specified camera model. Can you check that the open3d window screen was created without cropping?

		emmmm I reinstall the open3d and it does the same results. But after I turn my windows size small, it does work without warning. I want to do more testing on it, but I failed to generate my desired trajectory.
Here is my code, but I can't get a right list of the o_trajectory.parameters after I append some items. The size is always 0. Did I miss some points about the trajectory?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        o_trajectory=PinholeCameraTrajectory()
        intrinsic = PinholeCameraIntrinsic(1920, 1080, 1344, 1344, 960, 540)
        with open(os.path.join(current_dir,"arg/camera_input")) as f:
            strs=f.readline()
            while strs:
                tokens=strs.split(",")
                # Below are just some matrixes, their types are 4*4 ndarray
                xaxis, yaxis, zaxis = [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]
                Rx = rotation_matrix(float(tokens[4]), xaxis)
                Ry = rotation_matrix(0, yaxis)
                Rz = rotation_matrix(float(tokens[6]), zaxis)
                R = concatenate_matrices(Rx, Ry, Rz)
                T = translation_matrix([float(tokens[1]),float(tokens[2]),float(tokens[3])])
                M = concatenate_matrices(T, R)
                extrinsic=M
                # Above are just some matrixes, their types are 4*4 ndarray
                camera_param=PinholeCameraParameters()
                camera_param.intrinsic=intrinsic
                camera_param.extrinsic=extrinsic
                o_trajectory.parameters.append(camera_param)

                strs = f.readline()

        write_pinhole_camera_trajectory(os.path.join(current_dir,"arg/trajectory.json"),o_trajectory)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I found that the window size will be 1920*1055 if I left the default setting 1920*1080. And then the check will be failed.

		<comment id='7' author='whatseven' date='2019-01-10T09:37:51Z'>
		My quick answer: I think the code should produce the trajectory if f reads something. Regarding window size, I believe the windows shouldn't be larger than the screen size.

		I am using open3d 0.4.0.0 with python3.6 on ubuntu. And I have met the same warning when I set the intrinsic with height=480,width=640. Is there any way that I can get the window size by python ?

I also met this problem when I use two screens with different resolutions (screen 1: 1920x1080, screen 2:1080x987).
I found that the open3d window will always automatically appear on screen 1.  When I ran the python script (window width and height are default) in screen 2 (the terminal where the script was run was in the screen 2), then there will be the "ConvertFromPinholeCameraParameters() failed because window height and width do not match" error. If I ran the python script in screen 1, then there will be no error.

I didn't know whether it had something to do with it.

When I fixed the window size with a smaller resolution (640x480) and print out the vis.get_view_control().convert_to_pinhole_camera_parameters().intrinsic and trajectory.parameters[0].intrinsic. I found that both the intrinsics (width and height ) are the same. However, if I ran the python script, no matter on which screen the script was run, they both will produce the "ConvertFromPinholeCameraParameters() failed because window height and width do not match" error. I don't know what leads to the  error? It seems that all the intrinsics match.

		@Forest75 I had the same problem appending to trajectory.parameters, I had to create a separate list and assign it's value.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;trajectory = o3d.camera.PinholeCameraTrajectory()
param_list = []
param_list.append(cam_d4150_params)
trajectory.parameters = param_list
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
