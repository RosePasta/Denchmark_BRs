Don't load textures in gltf

I am loading gltf via  mesh = open3d.io.read_triangle_mesh(...path) but Visualizer dont load textures. Also in my case I have only 1 mesh pic.

		At this moment, Open3D only supports obj format for loading a texture map. We will put this request on our to-do-list, but it would be great if you give us a hand. :)

 Thanks for answer. Does obj with multiple textures support also or need only one texture img?

		This is solved in the new rendering module. We have full support for gltf
