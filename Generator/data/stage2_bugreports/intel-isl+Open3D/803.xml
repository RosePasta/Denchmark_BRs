	<summary>Depth range clipping issue in Visualizer</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The depth buffer for the rendering does not configure correctly if the camera is located to far to the object we want to render. This is not happening when Visualizer class automatically determine the view point, but happens if the real intrinsic and extrinsic matrices are used.
Because of this issue, some geometries are not rendered and clipped based on the depth.
To Reproduce
Load a object, place camera very far, render image
Expected behavior
All the geometries should be rendered
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Every platform
Version Open3D 0.5 dev

&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


I was able to render the full object by changing this line
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IntelVCL/Open3D/blob/fab6441b763b4964ef898cbb3fae8d10ef98442f/src/Visualization/Visualizer/ViewControl.cpp#L69&gt;https://github.com/IntelVCL/Open3D/blob/fab6441b763b4964ef898cbb3fae8d10ef98442f/src/Visualization/Visualizer/ViewControl.cpp#L69&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

to be:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;z_far_ = distance_ + 10.0 * bounding_box_.GetSize(); 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think distance_ or bounding_box_.GetSize() was not correctly set.

		This issue is more related how to compute . We have hard coded parameter  that is defined here:

Increasing MAX_ZOOM can avoid this issue.

		Thanks for this temporary solution of setting 3.0 to 10.0.

		Is there any news about this?
I think I run into the same issue trying to render 3D vehicle models aligned with the corresponding image. When the car is "far from the camera" the rendering fails (i.e. image is black). In some edge case you can really see the rendered model disappearing when it gets too far (see below).

Edit: Just noticed that it is also related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/766&gt;#766&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
