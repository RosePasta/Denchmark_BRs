		Umm, I cannot see any f-strings in the aforementioned script. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/griegler&gt;@griegler&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		No, I checked all the surface_reconstruction_*.py files and did not find any f-strings. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PerspectivesLab&gt;@PerspectivesLab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
