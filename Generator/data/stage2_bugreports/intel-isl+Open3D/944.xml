	<summary>Bad Script Implementation</summary>
	<description>
Don't use --yes in the install-deps-ubuntu.sh script. The reason being that sometimes there might be package conflicts and this will start to remove the packages without confirming with the user. It's not very funny and C-C does not stop the script for some reason.
