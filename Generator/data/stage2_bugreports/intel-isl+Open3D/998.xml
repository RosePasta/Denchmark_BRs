	<summary>Visualizer has no attribute "remove_geometry"</summary>
	<description>
There doesn't seem to be a remove_geometry function, even though I saw it in the python bindings
Running the remove_geometry.py example works fine for the adding of geometries to the viewer, but when the first call to remove_geometry to compiler throws
vis.remove_geometry(pcds[i])
AttributeError: 'open3d.open3d.visualization.Visualizer' object has no attribute 'remove_geometry'
I did install open3d via the package manager in pyCharm, however the version is 0.6. Could this installation method be the reason the method cannot be found?

OS: Windows 10.0
Python version: 2.7, pyCharm
Open3D version: 0.6

		Same problem as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/995&gt;#995&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The new version will be released very soon, or install from the sources.
