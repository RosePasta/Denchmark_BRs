		I just had the same problem but I've solved it by installing:

microsoft visual c++ 2015 redistributable
microsoft visual c++ 2013 redistributable
microsoft visual c++ 2012 redistributable

don't know which it was, I just installed them all.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/germanros1987&gt;@germanros1987&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Could you please add this as a dependencies?
Just a little hint would have saved me a lot of time...

		Hi all, the problem occurred when I use Python 3.8.0 on Win 10, and I have solved it by switching to Python 3.7.0. Considering this bug is caused by Python.

		Hello is there a valid solution to this problem?
I am on Win10. I have microsoft visual c++ 2017 redistributable installed
and I have also downgraded Python to 3.6 but I still get the error

 I had a same problem and solved now.
I also had "ImportError: DLL load failed" error.
My environments before,
Windows 10 64bit, Visual studio 2017,
Python 3.7.5 (with Anaconda), Open3D 0.9.0.0 installed from pip
And then I installed "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019".
First, visit below.
And install x86 and x64 packages in "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" section.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads&gt;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After install packages, reboot windows. Then the Open3D runs normally.

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
After install packages, reboot windows. Then the Open3D runs normally.

I have tried this, but still can't work at all.
but somehow I have solved it with the old version (Open3D 0.6).
I also had "ImportError: DLL load failed" error. and I use conda environment. and also I use windows 10.
First, follow &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ivorycirrus&gt;@ivorycirrus&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 step (installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable ). If you still had bug, continue to the next step
Second, i just create new environment conda with python 3.6
"conda create -n  python=3.6"
and activate it
"conda activate "
third. download packages library from here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://anaconda.org/open3d-admin/open3d/files?sort=ndownloads&amp;sort_order=desc&amp;version=0.6.0.0&amp;type=conda&gt;https://anaconda.org/open3d-admin/open3d/files?sort=ndownloads&amp;sort_order=desc&amp;version=0.6.0.0&amp;type=conda&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

for my case, I download win64 py36.
fourth. install it with this command (makes sure that you are in your environment)
"conda install "
fifth. when I tried to run "import open3d", I got an error, because numpy hasn't installed yet. So I tried to install it with
"conda install numpy"
Then, somehow... it works.
(sorry for my broken English)

I resolved by deleting the "." before open3d:

		I had same problem
OS: Windows 10
Python version: 3.7.6
Open3D version: 0.9.0.0
I resolved  by installed VC++ DLL x86,x64 both package.
x86: vc_redist.x86.exe
x64: vc_redist.x64.exe
if show dll load error yet
I recomend check dependency of   lib\site-packages\open3d\open3d.cp37-win_amd64.pyd
with Dependecies tool.

		I tested Open3D 0.9.0 pip and Conda installation under Windows 10 64-bit with python3.7 and they're all working for me.
Here's the full terminal recording for pip install:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://terminalizer.com/view/fcc321e93273&gt;https://terminalizer.com/view/fcc321e93273&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here's the full terminal recording for conda install:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://terminalizer.com/view/0c3811b03274&gt;https://terminalizer.com/view/0c3811b03274&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please try with the exact same command (including creating a fresh environment and activating it), and see if the problem still exists.

. In short, the reported issue is not reproducible with up-to-date python env and open3d package. Closing issue.
