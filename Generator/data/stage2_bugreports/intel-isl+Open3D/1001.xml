<bug id='1001' author='AndreiBarsan' open_date='2019-06-04T17:53:25Z' closed_time='2019-10-07T06:15:00Z'>
	<summary>Fast Global Registration does not populate `fitness`, `inlier_rmse`, and `corres</summary>
	<description>
Bug description
The open3d.registration.RegistrationResult object returned by open3d.registration.registration_fast_based_on_feature_matching contains confusing results, with fields like fitness always being 0 even if the match is nearly perfect.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior (from repository root):

cd examples/Python/Advanced/
Edit fast_global_registration.py to include print(result_fast) in the end.
python fast_global_registration.py

Expected behavior
Either (1) shows some non-zero 'fitness' for a near-perfect match, or (2) the documents clearly state that FGR is not expected to populate this field (or inlier RMSE, correspondence set size, etc.)
Actual behavior
'fitness', 'inlier_rmse', and 'correspondence_set_size' are always zero, even when FGR works perfectly. Other methods, including the vanilla (slow) global registration and ICP always set these fields accordingly.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 14.04
Python version: 3.6.8, 2.7
Open3D version: 0.6.0
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: conda

		I can confirm this behavior:
OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Python: 3.6.8
Open3D 0.7.0
Not remote workstation
Installed via pip

		Hi,
this might be a stupid question, but how can I get this bugfix?
I'm using open3d 0.8.0.0 and python 3.6.9 under Windows 10. I have updated my open3d package using conda, but still, 'fitness', 'inlier_rmse', and 'correspondence_set_size' are always zero.
Thank you!

 This PR was contributed after the  release. To get it, you can build open3d from source, or wait 2-3 weeks for the new release.
