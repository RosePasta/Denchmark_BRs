	<summary>Can not compile, since unary_function is removed from c++17</summary>
	<description>
When I use Open3D in a C++17 project (compiled with visual studio 2019 preview), I get an error :
“unary_function”: is not a member of "std", which occurs in Open3D/Utility/Helper.h Line 90.
And I find that unary_function is removed from c++17, could you use std::function to replace that, and make it compiled by c++ 17 compiler?
