Describe the bug
When installing open3d from pip, an Error message appears saying...
ERROR: jsonschema 3.2.0 has requirement six&gt;=1.11.0, but you'll have six 1.10.0 which is incompatible.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

In a terminal (not virtual environment), type 'pip install open3d'
Wait a few seconds
See error

Expected behavior
No error message to appear and that the right version of 'six' is installed

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 16.04
Python version: 2.7.12
Open3D version: 0.9.0
Is this remote workstation?: no
How did you install Open3D?: pip version 20.0.2

Additional context
Open3d still imports correctly in python, but I'm not sure how necessary that dependency ( jsonschema 3.2.0) is.

 could you try with python 3? This should avoid the issue with . In the future, we'll be dropping python 2 support.

		I was already able to get it working using Python 3. I wanted to try using Python 2 though so that I could use Open3D in ROS (Kinetic and Melodic).

 Unfortunately, we are spending less time to check compatibility issue with Python 2.x. In the future, as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yxlao&gt;@yxlao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned, Open3D will be released only with Python 3.x. Please understand this, since we are trying to focus on up-to-date environments. If you are willing to give a hand to solve the issue, that would be great though :)
