	<summary>Arrow mesh collapses when transformation is applied</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When using TriangleMesh.createArrow(), the mesh "collapses" into a flat 2-D shape after applying a transformation (rotation).
To Reproduce
This code should reproduce the behavior:
import numpy as np
import open3d as o3d

def rot_z_to_x():
    R = np.zeros((3,3))
    R[0,2] = 1
    R[2,0] = -1
    return R

def trans_z_to_x():
    T = np.zeros((4,4))
    T[0:3, 0:3] = rot_z_to_x()
    T[3,3]=1
    return T

def x_arrow():
    arrow = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh.create_arrow(cylinder_radius=0.05, cone_radius=0.1, cylinder_height=0.6, cone_height=0.3)
    arrow.transform(trans_z_to_x())
    return arrow

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arrow = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh.create_arrow(cylinder_radius=0.05, cone_radius=0.1, cylinder_height=0.6, cone_height=0.3)
    o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([x_arrow(), arrow])
Expected behavior
I expect the arrow to be transformed from being aligned with the z axis (by default) to the x coordinate frame.
This is the case, but as you can see on the screenshot below, the mesh seems to collapse.

		I think you have a problem in this function
def rot_z_to_x():
    R = np.zeros((3,3))
    R[0,2] = 1
    R[2,0] = -1
    return R
This creates a matrix [[0,0,1], [0,0,0], [-1,0,0]], which always maps the y-coordinate to zero.

		Oh you're right! I forgot the 1 at R[1,1]. Sorry for the bother!
