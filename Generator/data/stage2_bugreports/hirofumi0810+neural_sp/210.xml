	<summary>The function eval_wordpiece in asr/eval.py doesn't support keyword argument 'teacher_force'</summary>
	<description>
Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hirofumi0810&gt;@hirofumi0810&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , thanks for your great work.
I'm now trying the csj example. I've passed the training phase using the run.sh script and got the model successfully. The conf file that I'm using is the default conf/asr/blstm_las.yaml.
When I tried the local/score.sh for evaluation, I got an error that says TypeError: eval_wordpiece() got an unexpected keyword argument 'teacher_force'. Here is the whole output,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Original utterance num: 1272
Removed 0 empty utterances
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/lijian/workspace/github-repos/neural_sp/examples/csj/s5/../../../neural_sp/bin/asr/eval.py", line 240, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "/home/lijian/workspace/github-repos/neural_sp/examples/csj/s5/../../../neural_sp/bin/asr/eval.py", line 180, in main
    teacher_force=len(args.recog_word_alignments) &gt; 0)
TypeError: eval_wordpiece() got an unexpected keyword argument 'teacher_force'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hirofumi0810/neural_sp/blob/master/neural_sp/bin/asr/eval.py#L180&gt;https://github.com/hirofumi0810/neural_sp/blob/master/neural_sp/bin/asr/eval.py#L180&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , it calls  with a keyword argument . But
it seems that the  function defined &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hirofumi0810/neural_sp/blob/master/neural_sp/evaluators/wordpiece.py#L16&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 doesn't support this keyword argument. The code that I'm using is from the master branch (commit hash &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hirofumi0810/neural_sp/commit/7a9ec231d50a9ed6a0457a6c582526173c8ceb6b&gt;7a9ec23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
Could you please take a look of this? Thanks.

 Thank you. This is indeed a bug. I'll fix by tomorrow and add some test codes for inference.
