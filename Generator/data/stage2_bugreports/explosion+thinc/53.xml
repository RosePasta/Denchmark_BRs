	<summary>Can't pickle nested function in FeatureExtracter</summary>
	<description>
spaCy: 2.0.9
thinc: 6.10.2
joblib: 0.11
I am testing out spaCy (thanks very much for the library - it was of great help in my dissertation) and tried to run the multi_processing.py example as I am having some trouble with processes and spaCy dying for no reason (or error message)...  My code runs fine when not using multiprocessing (I'm not using joblib), but breaks when I run spacy in a child process. So I wanted to see how using joblib works.  I expected multi_processing.py to run without any problems but got this:
Traceback (most recent call last):

AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'FeatureExtracter..feature_extracter_fwd'
So in tracking down what is going on, and examining the thinc source code, it is obvious the nested functions in thinc.api.FeatureExtracter are the issue.  No idea of what to do, but am filing this as the issues raised in spaCy (#1862, #1669) do not mention any related issues in thinc and I don't see anything here.

I recently experienced the same problem as above. I just updated thinc to 6.11.2 to fix the pickle error associated with thinc.api.FeatureExtracter. However with this new updated thinc version, i get a new error:
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'with_flatten.&lt;locals&gt;.begin_update'

		Python 3.6.6
Spacy: 2.0.12
Thinc: 6.10.3
I have got the same problem Reason: 'AttributeError("Can't pickle local object 'FeatureExtracter.&lt;locals&gt;.feature_extracter_fwd'",)'.
