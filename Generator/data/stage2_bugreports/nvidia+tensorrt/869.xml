	<summary>Cannot download ngc models in demo/BERT at release/7.2</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When following the instructions to reproduce the benchmarks in the demo/BERT readme I get stuck when trying to download models from NGC. For example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;bash scripts/download_model.sh large fp16 384 v2
Error: nvidia/bert_tf_v2_large_fp16_384:2 could not be found.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This error occurs for all configurations I have tried, including the defaults. I have also tried browsing NGC online catalogue to find the models manually but I cannot find the tags the download_model.sh script is searching for.
Thanks

 Yes it's a bug on our side, we're working to re-upload these checkpoints soon. Sorry for the inconvenience.

		Sorry for the inconvenience. Some of our NGC checkpoints were deleted - we will upload the new checkpoints by tomorrow (11/4) morning. I will post an update here as soon as that happens.
