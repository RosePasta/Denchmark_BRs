	<summary>Using sequence combiner</summary>
	<description>
I'd like to be able to process a sequence of records in an RNN.  The following seems to work:
data:
x,y,label
a b c, d e f, 1
z x y, t r q, 0
a b c, d e f, 1
z x y, t r q, 0
a b c, d e f, 1
...
i.e., the first sequence of records is [[a, d],[b, e], [c, f]] with label 1.
model:
input_features:
name: x
type: sequence
encoder: embed
reduce_output: null
name: y
type: sequence
encoder: embed
reduce_output: null
combiner:
type: sequence
main_sequence_feature: x
encoder: rnn
output_features:
name: label
type: binary
The following does not:
data:
x,y,label
3.4 5.6 6.9, a b c, 1
3.4 5.6 6.9, a b c, 1
3.4 5.6 6.9, a b c, 1
3.4 5.6 6.9, a b c, 1
model
input_features:
name: x
type: timeseries
encoder: embed
reduce_output: null
name: y
type: sequence
encoder: embed
reduce_output: null
combiner:
type: sequence
main_sequence_feature: x
encoder: rnn
output_features:
name: label
type: binary
I don't really want to embed the time series features, but it seems like i need to specify some kind of encoder.  At any rate...it doesn't work.  Is there any way to support combining categorical and numerical features together and running through an rnn?
thanks!

		update:
I created a passthrough encoder which does nothing except reshape the input_sequence and changed  line 144 in timeseries_feature.py so that the type would be tf.float32 instead of tf.int32 and I am able to train with the data set referenced above.  am not very familiar with code base, so don't really know if this makes sense.  in particular, is line 144 a bug?

		Thanks for this, I was actually working EXACTLY on this issue locally, I just pushed that in this branch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uber/ludwig/tree/timeseries_fix&gt;https://github.com/uber/ludwig/tree/timeseries_fix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Please try it out with your data and let me know if it works, as in case i will add it to master immediately.

		Out of curiosity, for which type of use case is this data format used ?
I'm asking because I'm looking into doing classification for timeseries data where my columns are numerical and categorical but I can't see how to achieve this with ludwig (the doc only shows the input feature as a sequence of numbers separated by spaces).
Thanks

		hidden_size = input.sequence.shape[-1] rather than
hidden_size = input.sequence.shape()[-1] on line 72, but otherwise it seems to work!
thanks so much!!

Thanks

it's a pattern that we use for credit card or other transaction-oriented fraud detection

  is a sequence of categories while  is a sequence of numbers, you can combine them with the sequence combiner as long ad they are of the same length. Read the documentation &lt;denchmark-link:https://uber.github.io/ludwig/user_guide/#sequence-combiner&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

 i'm updating and merging the PR. Thank you! Also closing the thread,
