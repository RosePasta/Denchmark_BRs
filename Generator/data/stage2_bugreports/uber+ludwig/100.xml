	<summary>Cannot feed value of shape for Tensor when predicting model with image</summary>

I get this error when trying to perform prediction with a new image on trained model:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The model definition I use:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;input_features:
    -
        name: image_path
        type: image
        encoder: stacked_cnn
        in_memory: false
        height: 100
        width: 100

output_features:
    -
        name: tags
        type: set`
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Example of testing csv-file:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;image_path,tags
testdata/cat.101.jpg
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I've tried output features with category and set types but eventually get that error.

		Can you past the command you are using for prediction?
Are you using the --only_predict option?
Can you try removing the tags column as it is empty?
Thanks

		maybe check the input somewhere and added this np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

 I use command from the example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ludwig predict \
  --data_csv test.csv \
  --model_path results/experiment_run_0/model
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

--only_predictions option produces the same error.
About the tags column is a bit more interesting. If I remove the tags column in the test.csv and use the command without --only_predictions option the following error appears:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Loading metadata from: results/experiment_run_0/model/train_set_metadata.json
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "pandas/_libs/hashtable_class_helper.pxi", line 1608, in pandas._libs.hashtable.PyObjectHashTable.get_item
KeyError: 'tags'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I add --only_predictions option
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ludwig predict \
  --only_predictions \
  --data_csv test.csv \
  --model_path results/experiment_run_0/model
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

then I see the same error from the issue.
Thank you for the fast reply!

		Just a wild guess:
You feed uncropped/padded images into predict, but your model is trained on 100x100 size.
Predict is not resizing or in your case cropping/padding the images.
Edit: Same issue for me at the moment and that's what came to my mind

 After a couple attempts with uncropped image I tried to crop image exactly 100x100 size but the result was the same.

		Same issue for me. But when I predicted using cached hdf5 of original training data, it works without problems. Any new CSV files w/wo labels were still NOT working for prediction

		Got it, it may be the case that I'm not correctly applying the preprocessing to image features in prediction. Will look into it. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ydudin3&gt;@ydudin3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you also try to check this out?

 should have solved the issue. Can you please doublecheck? (remove the hdf5 and json files from your data dir before please).

  Sorry for the delay but I think that I probably do something wrong and I still can't get a prediction. I've completely cleaned dir from old computed data. All input data is the same as previous. Then retrained model with new code from PR. Next, when I try to predict I receive the error:

 thanks for reporting.
This is a different issue from the original one. It's probably stemming from the fact that you specified in_memory: false in the model definition, so the image preprocessing is trying to do the same thing at prediction time too. This is likely a different bug, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ydudin3&gt;@ydudin3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please look into this?
In the meantime, as a workaround, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abogoyavlensky&gt;@abogoyavlensky&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please trythe following.
First thing: we changed a bit the syntax for the in_memory, width and height parameters, no you should specify them in your YAML file this way:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;input_features:
    -
        name: image_path
        type: image
        encoder: stacked_cnn
        preprocessing:
            in_memory: false
            height: 100
            width: 100
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

so train a model with the updated yaml definition.
Then open the model directory, open the hyperaparameters json fine, remove the line that looks like "in_memory": truefrom it, and try to use the model to predict.
This time it should work, please let me know.

 I've tried your suggestion but I get the same error. Anyway, I think that the current issue is resolved and we could close it. I’m pretty sure that is something wrong with my dataset or there is a similar cause with misconfiguration and should fix it by myself. Thanks!

 I'd like to investigate this further, so I'm reopening it.
If you could please send me and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ydudin3&gt;@ydudin3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the command you use for training, the yaml file and a small sample of your data in one zip file that would be great and we can try to solve it ;)
