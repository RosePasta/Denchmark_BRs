	<summary>ludwig fails to work with uppercase extension names such as CSV and JSON</summary>
	<description>
On my Mac I'm trying to use a file with a .CSV extension such as input.CSV. Unfortunately, ludwig fails to load such files in preprocessing since string.replace in python is case sensitive.
Steps to reproduce (provided you already have a trained model):

Create your prediction data csv file and name it prediction.CSV
Execute command ludwig predict --data_csv prediction.CSV --model_path results/experiment_run_0/model

Expected behavior:
ludwig can read the file
Actual:
An exception is thrown:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;| |_  _ __| |_ __ _(_)__ _
| | || / _` \ V  V / / _` |
|_|\_,_\__,_|\_/\_/|_\__, |
                     |___/
ludwig v0.1.0 - Predict

Dataset type: generic
Dataset path: prediction.CSV
Model path: results/experiment_run_0/model
Output path: results_0

Found hdf5 with the same filename of the csv, using it instead
Loading metadata from: results/experiment_run_0/model/train_set_metadata.json
Loading data from: prediction.CSV
