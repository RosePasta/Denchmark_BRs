	<summary>DIIN model empty sequence error</summary>
	<description>
I'm running DIIN model for document classificaition task, somehow I came into ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence which indicate matchzoo/dataloader/callbacks/padding.py, line 114


MatchZoo-py/matchzoo/dataloader/callbacks/padding.py


        Lines 136 to 139
      in
      49548ad






 ngram_length_left = max([len(w) 



 for k in x['ngram_left'] for w in k]) 



 ngram_length_right = max([len(w) 



 for k in x['ngram_right'] for w in k]) 




 It seems that x['ngram_left'] value is a null list, I wonder wheter it should be x['text_left'] and I have a try which turns out TypeError: object of type 'numpy.int64' has no len(). Then I take a peak at the value type of both but still have no clue.
Any help will be appreciated.
MZ version: 1.1

		Thanks a lot for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/caiyinqiong&gt;@caiyinqiong&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's help.
Here are some solutions for the issue I encountered:

Keep your matchzoo up-to-date (pip recommended)
Different models may should set callbacks in specific mode, which could refer this DIIN ranking sample
RuntimeError: cuda runtime error (59) : device-side assert triggered at /pytorch/aten/src/THCUNN/generic/ClassNLLCriterion.cu:110 are mostly caused by label index, label index should be non-negetive values starting from 0 when encoding in one-hot, more detailed information can be found on this stackoverflow post and same issue solution
