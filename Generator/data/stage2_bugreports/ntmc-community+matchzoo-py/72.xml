	<summary>AttributeError: type object 'Path' has no attribute 'expanduser'</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
My python versions is 2.7 and 3.6.
When I import torch and then import matchzoo as mz in python 2.7 I receive this error:
"AttributeError: type object 'Path' has no attribute 'expanduser'"
and in python3 I receive this error:
"ImportError: cannot import name 'ensure_object'"
while matchzoo-py installed completely successfully.
I would appreciate it if you guide me.
Many thanks before all

		Hi Zahra,
MatchZoo only supports Python 3.6+. Can you provide more details about the error?

		Dear Chris,
Thanks for your fast reply.
I found the reason. Since I have had different versions of python on my server, conflict would be occurred. For solving the problem I install matchzoo-py by the following command:
python3 -m pip install matchzoo-py --user
I hope this could be helpful for every one who has the same problem.
Thanks
