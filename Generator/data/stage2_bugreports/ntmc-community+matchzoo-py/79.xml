	<summary>Load_glove_embedding with toy dataset</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When I use toy dataset I see the following error in this line:
glove_embedding = mz.datasets.embeddings.load_glove_embedding(dimension=300)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 6148: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;
I would appreciate it if you guide me how to solve this problem.
I wish you answer my questions a little bit faster since the time passes quickly :)
Thanks

		Can you provide your code snippet so that we can reproduce the error?

		Thanks for your fast reply. Of course, here you are:
import torch import matchzoo as mz if __name__ == '__main__': glove_embedding = mz.datasets.embeddings.load_glove_embedding(dimension=50)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 2273: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;
I searched this error and found that in embedding.py lines 90 and 96:
with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
could be changed to
with open(file_path, 'r', encoding="utf8") as f:
Do you agree with me?
Although it is interesting that know the reason since we are working on English documents.
Thanks

		Hi Zahra,
I tested the code you provided, but no error. Which version of Python do you use? MatchZoo-py only supports Python 3.6+

		Hi Chris,
Python 3.6.8. Also, I installed matchzoo-py successfully.

		You can add encoding="utf-8" by yourself and have a try.
