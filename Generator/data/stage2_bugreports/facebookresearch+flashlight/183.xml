	<summary>Compilation error for StringTest, SystemTest and DictTest</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Just a compilation error with some xTest.cpp :
[ 12%] Building CXX object lib/test/CMakeFiles/StringTest.dir/common/StringTest.cpp.o g++  -DFL_LIBRARIES_USE_CUDA -I/usr/local/cuda/include -Irepos/flashlight -Irepos/flashlight/release/googletest/src/gtest/googletest/include -Irepos/flashlight/release/googletest/src/gtest/googlemock/include -Irepos/flashlight/.. -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu  -O3 -DNDEBUG   -pthread -std=gnu++11 -o CMakeFiles/StringTest.dir/common/StringTest.cpp.o -c repos/flashlight/lib/test/common/StringTest.cpp flashlight/lib/test/common/StringTest.cpp:11:26: fatal error: glog/logging.h: No such file or directory #include &lt;glog/logging.h&gt; 
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Reproduction Steps&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Any configurations or custom setup : default ubuntu, glog-dev just not installed in the OS
Commands to run: cmake &amp;&amp; make

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Platform and Hardware&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ubuntu 18, gcc6
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Additional Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is a find glog in the asr cmake script:
find_package(GLOG REQUIRED)
but none in
lib/test/CMakeLists.txt
Adding a find glog there would at least early stop at cmake time warning that unittests do need glog.
That being said, glog does not seem to be needed by StringTest, SystemTest, ... so just removing the include seems to fix this issue.

 â€” as far as I can tell, there's no glog stuff being used in . Do you want to send a PR to remove the ? If it doesn't compile and glog is used in some way, we should remove it, since we don't want  to have any dependencies. Feel free to also remove those things in your PR.
