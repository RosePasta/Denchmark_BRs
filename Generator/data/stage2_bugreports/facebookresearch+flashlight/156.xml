	<summary>Error in cmake step (maybe related to cereal missing)</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to build version 0.2 (because it is a requirement for wav2letter++).
I successfully built arrayfire and installed mkldnn via sudo apt-get install libmkldnn-dev on Ubuntu 20.4
I try to build flashlight with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFLASHLIGHT_BACKEND=CPU -DArrayFire_DIR=/home/jadmin/kaalam.github/arrayfire/build
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It fails, I see three errors.
1 y 2 In the output
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- ArrayFire found (include: /home/jadmin/kaalam.github/arrayfire/include, library: ArrayFire::afcuda)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and in CMakeError.log
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/snip/

/usr/bin/ld: src.c:(.text+0x52): undefined reference to `pthread_detach'
/usr/bin/ld: src.c:(.text+0x63): undefined reference to `pthread_join'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

/snip/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

There are more mkl_* errors. The cereal library is supposed to be installed with arrayfire according to the documentation in &lt;denchmark-link:https://fl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html&gt;https://fl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

"The following dependencies are downloaded, built, and installed automatically with flashlight". There are no instructions on how to install cereal (Ubuntu has a different package with the same name and there are no instructions in either the repository nor the website)
The last error is not a dependency, pthread_detach is part of the STL.

		Look like failure to link with pthread library.
Is it failing on building Flashlight or Wav2letter
What is the top commit SHA (when you do git log) ?
Please consider moving to the latest Flashlight version which have wav2letter consolidated into it at directory flashlight/app/asr
