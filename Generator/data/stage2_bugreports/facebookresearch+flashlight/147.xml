&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm trying to build flashlight from sources with Cuda backend following steps provided in the documentation but an error occurs in "/flashlight/autograd/backend/cuda/CudnnUtils.cpp". The compiler says (see full logs at the end) :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;error: ‘cudnnSetRNNDescriptor’ was not declared in this scope; did you mean ‘cudnnSetLRNDescriptor’?
  280 |   CUDNN_CHECK_ERR(cudnnSetRNNDescriptor(

		Was trying to build it myself just now, looks like it depends on cudnn version. At least I had the same error. Looks like cudnnSetRNNDescriptor doesn't exist in cudnn 8.0.2. Haven't tried older cudnn version, but using of cudnnSetRNNDescriptor_v6 worked for me (at least build completed ok).
You just need to change cudnn version here flashlight/autograd/backend/cuda/CudnnUtils.cpp on that line 279 #if CUDNN_VERSION &gt;= 7000 to smth like 10000 to always compile it with _v6 version

		Did some research on the cuDNN 8.0.2 documentation and effectively it appears that cudnnSetRNNDescriptor no longer exists in this version. It has been replaced by cudnnSetRNNDescriptor_v8 but they don't have the same prototype, replacing the first one by the new one won't work. So the code has to be adapted to be fully compatible with cuDNN 8 and greater (cudnnSetRNNDescriptor_v8 should be rename as cudnnSetRNNDescriptor in cuDNN 9).
Anyway cudnnSetRNNDescriptor_v6 is still available in cuDNN 8 so we can keep using it for this version !
API References doesn't mention  anymore but : &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/api/index.html#cudnnSetRNNDescriptor_v8&gt;https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/api/index.html#cudnnSetRNNDescriptor_v8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for pointing this for new cudnn version, we will work on fixes for this.

		I managed to solve the issue by installing libcudnn7 and libcudnn7-dev instead of v8 (which is the latest version in Ubuntu repository and on NVDIA downloads website).
However, it would be nice if the latest change from master is also applied to the branch v0.2, allowing us to build flashlight for wav2letter++ with the latest cuDNN.
Thanks!

 Sorry, but we are not going to update branch v0.2 as we have a lot of changes/improvements/updates in current master. I have committed several bug fixes in v0.2 only for emergency fixes so that people can continue experiments with v0.2 while we are preparing new stable master. Please wait a new stable version of master where we have upgrades for cmake, cuda, cudnn, a lot of bug fixes, improvement of API, new layers/models, vcpkg support and a lot of other things =) .

Until stable master is available, what is recommended in the interim for wav2letter++? Use v0.2 or current master?
