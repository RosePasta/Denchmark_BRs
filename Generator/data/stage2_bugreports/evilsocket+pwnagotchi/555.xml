	<summary>[BUG] screen_refresh with waveshare_2 break display</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The screen start showing garbage, or even completely crash, when using the screen_refresh plugin on the waveshare v2
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

enable the screen_refresh plugin
wait for a full refresh

Expected behavior
The screen should do a full refresh, and continue to work afterward.
Environment (please complete the following information):

1.2.1
pi0w
waveshare v2

Additional context
Waveshare v2 use partial refresh all the time.
According to Waveshare specs, you should do a full refresh once in a while when using partial mode to avoid ghosting and burn in issue.
Additionally, in my case, I sometimes get quite severe ghosting + black dots in the background, and using the screen_refresh plugin seems to help.
PR about this will follow.

		that is why the plugin has been moved in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi-plugins-contrib&gt;a separate repo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		not according to specs : &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT&gt;https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Note that you cannot use Partial refresh all the time, you should full refresh e-paper regularly, otherwise, ghost problem will get worse even damage.
