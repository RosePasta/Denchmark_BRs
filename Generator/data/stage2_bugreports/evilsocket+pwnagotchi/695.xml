		Try with another cable, maybe it's a false contact of usb connector

 Unfortunately, I've tried with 3 different cables, same result. It only worked once...

		Try checking pwnagotchi.log in /var/log if there's something about or with webui button via bluetooth (if you have configured). Seems to be more an hardware problem than software (maybe usb port was damaged staying in pocket, like mine before UPS-lite)

 It looks like it has something to do with USB3 ports which do not look like working well with the g_ether gadget... I'm closing the issue.
