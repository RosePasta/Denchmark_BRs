	<summary>[BUG] Plugins tab not working in web UI</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When in web UI, the plugins tab isn't working: cannot click on plugins settings (the titles) except "session-stats" (underlined and clickable), although the settings won't show up either.
Also, if I enable any of these plugins, nothing changes in config.yml file in
/etc/pwnagotchi/config.yml
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Plugged my Pwnagotchi into the data port on RPi0W and booted into manu mode,
2. Logged into web UI at 10.0.0.2:8080,
3. Clicked on plugins tab.
When enabling plugins:
1. Click on "Enable" in plugins tab,
2. ssh pi@10.0.0.2
3. cd /etc/pwnagotchi/
4. nano config.yml
5. nothing has changed to config file.
Expected behavior
Expected to be able to click on plugins settings and enabling plugins in web UI to make changes to config.yml file.
Environment:

Pwnagotchi version: 1.4.3 [latest release]
OS version: Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
Type of hardware: Raspberry Pi 0 W
Any additional hardware used: I2C Real Time Clock
