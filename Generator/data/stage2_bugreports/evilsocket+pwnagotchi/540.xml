	<description>
Describe the bug
Whitelist no matter how entered is not used, my SSID is still pwned.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Launch with whitelist enabled and provide SSID list
wait
It will start pwning the whitelisted SSIDs and pcap files will appear.

Expected behavior
Should not pwn whitelist SSIDs
Whitelisted SSID pcap files should not show up
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version 1.1.1
pwnagotchi image download 1.1.1
Raspberry Pi 3+
Google WiFi mesh is being whitelisted

		I'm also seeing this behavior.
I've attempted the following white list formats
First attempt:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;main:
  name: 'pwnagotchi'
  whitelist:
    - 'YourHomeNetworkMaybe'
    - 'Your  Second home Maybe'
  plugins:
    grid:
      enabled: true
      report: true
      exclude:
    - 'YourHomeNetworkMaybe'
    - 'Your  Second home Maybe'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other attempt
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;main:
  name: 'pwnagotchi'
  whitelist:
    - YourHomeNetworkMaybe
    - Your  Second home Maybe
  plugins:
    grid:
      enabled: true
      report: true
      exclude:
    - YourHomeNetworkMaybe
    - Your  Second home Maybe
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I noticed that too. Then I saw that the FAQ on pwnagotchi.ai says:
Your access points handshakes get still captured. This only prevents the deauth of the clients.

		Mine looks similar to this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;main:
    name: 'mygotchi'
    whitelist:
        - 'MYNetwork'
        - 'TheOtherNet'
    plugins:
        grid:
            enalbed: true
            report: true
            exlude:
                - 'MYNetwork'
                - 'TheOtherNet'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the problem still occurs, I see it in the UI as well
Would be nice if the all attempts or captures did not occur if this they are whitelisted

No pcaps and ignore SSID totally

		Guys, like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nucow69&gt;@nucow69&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said already, this is an expected behaviour. The whitelisted APs won't get "pwned" aka. deauthed, but captured. This is not a bug.

		As per docs:
Your access points handshakes get still captured. This only prevents the deauth of the clients.

		This should be mentioned on pwnagotchi.ai's configuration page.   Thank you for the info :3

		Adding this to the docs would make a lot of sense. I'll see if I can add it and get it past PR.
