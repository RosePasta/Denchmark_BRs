	<summary>[BUG] Not uploading all the networks to pwngrid</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
If internet is interrupted (shutdown/reboot etc) while uploading the networks, the number of networks shown in my profile (on pwnagotchi.ai) is wrong and is not corrected nevermore. Is there a way to force the update or re-do it to show the correct number?
To Reproduce

Get some networks
Connect the pwnagotchi into the computer
Watch the pcaps being uploaded and reported
Cut the internet (or shutdown the pwnagotchi) before it finishes uploading
Turn it on again
It does not reports the missing networks that it could not report in the session before

Expected behavior
The number of pwned networks shown in my web ui (187) should be equal to the one reported on the site (51, for example).
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: 1.3.0
Pi0W


I tried the "duplicated networks" bugfix ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/pull/658&gt;#658&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) but it didn't worked. Kept showing incorrect  number on site and did not reported the missing networks.

		Forget, everything working now. Just cleared the right file (.api-report.json) and forgot to overwrite it. Everything working as it should!
