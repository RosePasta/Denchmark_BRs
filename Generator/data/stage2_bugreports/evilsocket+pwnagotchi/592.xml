	<summary>Epochs run long when internet is not available</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/files/3836535/pwnagotchi-test.log&gt;pwnagotchi-test.log&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When there is no connectivity to the internet (specifically the API, &lt;denchmark-link:https://api.pwnagotchi.ai&gt;https://api.pwnagotchi.ai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), pwnagotchi runs very slowly (long epochs) with CPU usage under 50%.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Power on pwnagotchi with no internet
Wait for AI to load
Wait an hour or so
After about an hour of runtime, the logs should show long-running epochs ( &gt; 20min) once the AI has loaded.

Expectation is the realtime length for an epoch to be far less than 20 minutes. With internet connectivity, epochs usually last less than 5 minutes.
Environment

pwnagotchi v1.2.1
pwngrid v1.10.1
pi0w

Attached file shows output of "egrep -a "[epoch|brain.nn" /var/log/pwnagotchi.log |tail -n 80". The first 33 epochs in this file cover almost 8 hours of runtime off of a battery with no internet connectivity. The next 6 epochs cover 43 minutes of runtime off of a USB connection with connection sharing blocked by the host.
Also of note is the pwngrid-peer.log, which mostly consists of lines that look like:

		Wait this is the same thing i had happen to me a long time ago when i said i had like 36% cpu usage when i wait 45 min or more and then connect bt tether, yeah this is interesting

		Yeah, same thing most likely. I tested on my laptop by not routing the pi to the internet, ran for a couple hours and went through about 4 epochs, then setup iptables to route the pi and instantly saw 10 epochs in about 15 minutes.
I haven't dug into the code/scripts yet to see what it is doing, mostly because I am not familiar at all with go.

		i think the problem is here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/bin/pwnagotchi#L123&gt;https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/bin/pwnagotchi#L123&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ... the grid plugin attempts to talk with the API blocking the loop ... fixing

		if you have a way to test from master, let me know if the fix works üëç

		Yes! I think it works. Been running for about 30 - 40 minutes with the internet link cut-off, and already on the 18th epoch and 2nd training epoch. Thanks man!
