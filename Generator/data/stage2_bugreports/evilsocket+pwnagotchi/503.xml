		a very simple fix i have blocked all other DNS Server not that into my pfSense VM
i added it the Firewall a new roles that my pc that i using with my Pwnagotchi can go to all DNS my Computer like
i has got to &lt;denchmark-link:https://ip/firewall_rules.php?if=lan&gt;https://ip/firewall_rules.php?if=lan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and added above my Block all other DNS a new role
Protokoll: IPv4 UDP
Quelle: one Host or Alias IP of my PC
Ziel: all
Range of destination ports: from DNS(53) to DNS(53)
add a description to my new Role and saved it and now it works very fine
