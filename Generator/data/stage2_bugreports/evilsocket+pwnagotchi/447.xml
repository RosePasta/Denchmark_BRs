	<description>
Describe the bug
"systemctl restart pwnagotchi" crashes UI modules, So the UI just stops working, and the process "pwnagotchi" needs to be killed and started, or the whole device restarted. The rest runs in the background as I saw in the logs, yet I saw no errors about the UI.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Using command "systemctl restart pwnagotchi"

Expected behavior
Used to restart application pwnagotchi, recomendend when forced into manual mode to get back to automode
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: 1.1.0RC0
OS version: Same as used by 1.1.0RC0
Type of hardware: Pi ZeroW + InkyPhat B/W
Any additional hardware used: 5Ah Powerbank on PWR-only usb micro port
User-level: root
