Waveshare 2.13 Inch e-Paper Display Hat(B)
Hi, I have the following problem.
I've bought this ePaper display on Amazon
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B075FR81WL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&gt;https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B075FR81WL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

, it remains more leery after the installation of pwnagotchi.  I have now tried and found that the configatin waveshare_2 does not work, I have another display and it only works with the testscript
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/blob/master/RaspberryPi%26JetsonNano/python/examples/epd%5C_2in13bc%5C_test.py&gt;https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/blob/master/RaspberryPi%26JetsonNano/python/examples/epd\_2in13bc\_test.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What do I have to change in the configuration that it works under pwnagotchi.
Thank you

		'waveshare_1'
Color: 'red'
the screen works with this command but the refresh time is very fast to auto mode even with the command fps 0.0
if I find a solution I will not hesitate to share it.

@copysolo thanks, it work now. As you mentioned, refresh time is not right.

yes the refresh time of this screen is high.  I advise you to use for the moment the interface ui web time to find a solution, to avoid breaking your hardware

 def _refresh_handler(self): 





if       self._config['ui']['fps'] is 0.0  then the function will meet error.
Another found: In AI mode, there are so many change of main information. So  eink refresh quickly.
Maybe refresh time of this screen might relate with AI mechanism.

		I will try to take the risk of increasing the refresh time from 0 to 30, then 60 ect ... see if it has an impact
