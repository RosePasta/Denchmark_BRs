	<summary>[BUG] backup.sh includes defaults.yml which causes issues after upgrades</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The backup.sh script currently also includes defaults.yml. This can result in missing config values when updating your device.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

run backup.sh
upgrade your device
restore backup
check defaults.yml

Expected behavior
defaults.yml should be excluded from backup as the user should not change anything here. Another (probably better option) would be to not use /etc/pwnagotchi/defaults.yml but /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/defaults.yml and remove this problem completely.

		in the new release the defaults.yml just gets overwritten if it's different from the package one
