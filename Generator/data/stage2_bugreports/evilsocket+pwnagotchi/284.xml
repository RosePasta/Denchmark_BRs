	<summary>[BUG] Pcap files under /root/handshakes/ are saved that contain no handshakes</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
After running pwnagotchi for a day I noticed that nearly half of files saved under /root/handshakes/ contain no handshakes in them. There are packets in them, but only about 23 out of 70 files contain hanshakes among these packets.
Example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ aircrack-ng foobar.pcap
Opening foobar.pcap
Read 12 packets.

   #  BSSID              ESSID                     Encryption

   1  XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:X  foobar           WPA (0 handshake)

Choosing first network as target.

Opening foobar.pcap
Read 12 packets.

1 potential targets

Please specify a dictionary (option -w).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is that intentional? Are packet dumps supposed to be written there even though no handshakes have been caught?
Expected behavior
I'd expect no .pcap file to be saved under /root/handshakes for a particular AP if no handshakes have been obtained for the AP. I'd expect every file in that folder to contain handshakes.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: v1.0.0RC3
OS version: Pwnagotchi v1.0.0RC3 image from Github
Type of hardware: RPi0W

Additional context
This behavior is causing additional consequences for the onlinehashcrack plugin. A file containing 0 hanshakes will still get marked as uploaded.

		You could use the AircrackOnly plugin...

		The fact that aircrack can’t find handshakes doesn’t mean there aren’t any. Aircrack is not the only software.
