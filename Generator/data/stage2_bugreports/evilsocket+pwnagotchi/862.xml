		Hi, thanks for your report.
We changed the configuration language to toml. The defaults.yml doesn't works anymore and will be ignored.
Therefore, if your configuration directory contains a config.toml, your config.yml will be ignored too.
Please check the config.toml for errors^^

		hello,
thanks for that. Indeed it's there the problem.
Question, the upgrade has converted my config.yml to config.toml but I see a big difference of structure between my config.toml and the default.toml
my converted config.toml contains
[main]
name = "k4nfr3g0tchi"
lang = "en"
custom_plugins = "/root/pwnagotchi-plugins-contrib"
and the default.toml has
main.name = ""
main.lang = "en"
main.confd = "/etc/pwnagotchi/conf.d/"

What is the right format or does it matter ?
is there an issue in the upgrade tool if the result has a wrong format output ?

Regards

		I've changed to the format provided in default.toml and all works fine now.
Case close. Not sure if anybody want to look into the upgrade process script to adapt to the new format. (not sure)

		Maybe you want to delete your current config.toml and convert it again. There was a "style" change. But both works
