	<summary>[BUG] Too many accesspoints breaks screen</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I meet over 999 "friends", the screen tends to overflow
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Put in log that the pwnagotchi met over 999 friends
Start in manual mode
Check screen

Expected behavior
When the pwnagotchi meets too many friends, just show 99+ or "too many" instead of the number, to prevent the screen from overflowing.
Screenshots
Unfortunately did not catch it on screenshot, update caused it to crash.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version - 1.3.0
OS version - default
Type of hardware - Waveshare v2
Any additional hardware used - N/A

Additional context
Went out on quite a big run where it met too many accesspoints, +/- 1200 of them. When i came home, text was misaligned.
