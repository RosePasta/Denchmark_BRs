	<summary>[BUG] Grid plugin fails to load at startup</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When Pwnagotchi attempts to load the Grid plugin on startup, it displays this error resulting in the plugin failing to load and the Pwnagotchi's PwnGrid page not updating.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce

		The file /root/.api-report.json is probably malformed. Correct it or delete it^^ It should fix your problem.

		Following what &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dadav&gt;@dadav&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 said, I restored my .api-report.json backup (which was working  yesterday). Now, the grid plugin is initiating, but the following error appears when I look at the logs:
Dec 09 22:18:23 caramuru pwnagotchi-launcher[361]: [2019-12-09 22:18:23,289] [ERROR] [grid] error while checking pcaps: 'report'
What should I do?

		I experienced the same error as OP. Backing up /root/.api-report.json, restarting pwnagotchi service and pwngrid was able to sucessfully recreated /root/.api-report.json and begin parsing to report new networks again.
The parsing has started over from the very beginning, but hey it's moving along now.

		Thanks for your responses, it appears that /root/.api-report.json was causing the issue. I deleted it but didn't bother backing up the file as it didn't have any content and the problem was fixed when I re-ran pwnagotchi. :)
