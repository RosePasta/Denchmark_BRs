	<summary>[BUG] Changing bettercap credentials in config.toml breaks the pwnagotchi service</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Changing bettercap credentials in config.toml breaks the pwnagotchi service. The default username and password being pwnagotchi in both cases. Setting the username and password to anything else results in an authentication error when viewing the pwnagotchi logs.
To Reproduce

Flash fresh image (1.5.3) to SD card
Change bettercap.username = "pwnagotchi"and bettercap.password = "pwnagotchi" to anything you like
Reboot
pwnagotchi goes straight into AI mode and does not work.

Expected behavior
It should work.
Screenshots
Not needed.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version - 1.5.3
OS version - Raspbian Lite (as per the image that comes with 1.5.3)
Pi0 W but also on any other Pi model including 4

		if you want to change the password, you need to change it in bettercap too/first.
in the pwnagotchi config you only define the password for use bettercap.
that's not a bug!

Ah. I was confused then because on the wiki it talks about changing the credentials for the pwnagotchi UI in the .TOML file there, so I assumed you do the same for bettercap too.
