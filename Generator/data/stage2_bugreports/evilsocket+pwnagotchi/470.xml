	<summary>auto-update should update launchers and service files too</summary>
	<description>
Right now .service and launcher files are only updated if the full .img is reflashed as they're part of the builder. They should be migrated as assets of the python codebase that get installed from the setup.py during the pip3 install . update procedure.

 setup.py doesn't seem to be executed while using pip3 install ., any idea what'd be a nice way to have those files updated from the auto-update plugin?

		We could use the file-provisioner in the packer-file to copy the service-file and launcher files to the image. This way we would have them as real files in the repo and can easily include them into the auto-update process.

		Same probably goes for MOTD since it has a version number and links that could eventually change?

I would keep that in ansible and update the file in the auto-update plugin.
