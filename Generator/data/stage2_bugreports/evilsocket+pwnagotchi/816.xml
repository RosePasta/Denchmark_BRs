	<summary>[BUG] in /pwnagotchi/plugins/default/grid.py for numerical SSID in exclusion config</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Hi,
i had issues reporting with Pwngrid. I checked and the issue is in function is_excluded(self, what):
If in the config file, you added a numerical SSID, the code sees the variable as INT and not string, and therefor throws an error in line 60
skip = skip.lower()
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:


Add in config
plugins:
grid:
enabled: true
report: true # don't report pwned networks by default!
exclude: # do not report the following networks (accepts both ESSIDs and BSSIDs)
- 12345


you will find in the logs : [2020-01-27 11:57:34,768] [ERROR] [grid] error while checking pcaps: 'int' object has no attribute 'lower'


I'm no dev guy and have not much python experience.
Maybe we could add a simple type test
something along those lines
def is_excluded(self, what):
for skip in self.options['exclude']:
if (type(skip)==str) and (type(what)==str):
skip = skip.lower()
what = what.lower()
if skip in what or skip.replace(':', '') in what:
return True
return False

		better use " in config for all/complex SSIDs you want to ha dle as string.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;exclude: # do not report the following networks (accepts both ESSIDs and BSSIDs)
  - "12345"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

or you can run into trouble with SSIDs like "00000"=(0) "0xff"=(255) "iLove#tags" (iLove) and so on
so, imho thats not a bug in code, its in your config
