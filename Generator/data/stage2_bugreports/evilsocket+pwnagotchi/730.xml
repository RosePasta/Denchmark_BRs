	<summary>[BUG] Unable to connect via Bluetooth</summary>
	<description>
I have tried multiple Raspberry Pi Zero W's, connecting to either a phone or a laptop. From the Pi, I find the MAC of the remote device, successfully pair it, trust it, but I can never get it to actually connect.

		If it disconnects imidieatly after connecting then it could be because of missing bt-nap. (I'm having the same problem.) See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/issues/377&gt;#377&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more info.

		If you tried multiple raspis and it didnt work, there are 2 possibilities:

Your config is wrong
Your phone isn't in tether mode

		I wasn't aware that not having Bluetooth tethering would prevent it from connecting. It could be my phone, which doesn't have a Bluetooth Tether mode.
