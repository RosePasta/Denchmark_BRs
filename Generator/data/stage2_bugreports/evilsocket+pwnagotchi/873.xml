	<summary>[BUG] Reboot feature doesn't support fs.memory.enabled = true</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When filesystem memory caching is enabled the filesystem isn't synced prior to rebooting, so logs prior to the reboot are lost.
To Reproduce

Follow instructions at https://pwnagotchi.ai/configuration/#sdcard-protection to cache /var/log in memory.
Reboot pwnagotchi through web interface.
Confirm that /var/log/pwnagotchi.log doesn't contain "rebooting ..." message.

Expected behavior
All logs should be flushed to disk before reboot occurs.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: v1.5.3
OS version: Debian 10.3
Raspberry Pi Zero W
