	<summary>Negative Uptime with RTC</summary>
	<description>
I installed a RTC, set the time correctly earlier, and added this line to /boot/config.txt:
dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds3231
Now when I start up Pwnagotchi, I get UP time as -5:27:39, and it just sits there. Rebooting shows the same thing (The screen refreshes during reboot)

		Nevermind. Disabling the fake hwclock fixed it.
