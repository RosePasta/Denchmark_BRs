	<summary>[BUG] Shutdown feature doesn't log "shutting down ..." message when fs.memory.mounts.log.enabled = true</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When filesystem memory caching is enabled the filesystem is synced prior to shutdown but this happens before the "shutting down ..." message is logged, so it never makes it to disk before the shutdown happens.
To Reproduce

Follow instructions at https://pwnagotchi.ai/configuration/#sdcard-protection to cache /var/log in memory.
Shutdown pwnagotchi through web interface.
Confirm that /var/log/pwnagotchi.log contains "syncing..." message but not "shutting down ...".

Expected behavior
All logs should be flushed to disk before shutdown occurs.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: v1.5.3
OS version: Debian 10.3
Raspberry Pi Zero W
