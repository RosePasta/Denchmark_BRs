		Are you sure? As far as I can see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/pull/461&gt;#461&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is already included in 1.1.0:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/v1.1.0/builder/pwnagotchi.yml#L307&gt;https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/v1.1.0/builder/pwnagotchi.yml#L307&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When removing the part || [[ !$(grep '1' /sys/class/net/eth0/carrier) ]] it works as expected.
