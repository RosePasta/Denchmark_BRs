	<summary>[BUG] AircrackOnly.py deleted files even if handshake exists</summary>
	<description>
When AircrackOnly.py plugin is enabled, captured files are getting deleted even if there is a handshake in the file (confirmed in logs there is entry "[AircrackOnly] contains handshake")
To Reproduce

Enable AircrackOnly.py and restart Pwnagotchi
Log in via SSH and run the journalctl command to see the logs
Wait for a captured handshake
Confirm that the log has entry [AircrackOnly] contains handshake
Go to /root/handshakes and verify that no capture from the specific SSID exists

Expected behavior
The PCAP file gets removed only if there is no handshake AND no PMKID
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version 1.1.1
OS version
Type of hardware RPi0W
Any additional hardware used
