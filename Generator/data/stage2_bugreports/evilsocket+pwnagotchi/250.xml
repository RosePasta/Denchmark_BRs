	<summary>[BUG] pwnagotchi stops working after short time</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
After starting the pwnagotchi (RPI0W with waveshare v2) via PWR USB and waiting for around 5-10 min, the pwnagotchi stops working, no screen refreshes anymore, no ethernet ssh access. Same happens if started manually via ssh.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Unplug pwnagotchi
Plug in (USB PWR)
wait &lt; 30 min
no screen refreshes, looks dead

Expected behavior
The unit should stay on and refreshes the screen periodically, especially if it encounters new wifis.
Screenshots
None
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: RC2
Type of hardware: RPI0W
Any additional hardware used: waveshare v2 eink display

EDIT2:
running in manual mode does NOT introduce this problem.

		I had this problem before with a different project of mine, but not with pwnagotchi (I don't have a screen yet).
I suspect that the wifi enters power saving mode. So, try adding this line :
iw dev mon0 set power_save off in /usr/bin/monstart script and reboot.
Then, please report if this occurs again.

OLD:
I tried it. And your fix saved the kernel, but not the python script:

		I found this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/2794&gt;raspberrypi/linux#2794&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Looks like I fixed it with different power cable and more amps. Or maybe the SD-Card is shit. So if anyone has the same problem, change either the sd card or the cable/adapter or both

		This is getting mysterious. On my laptop booted in manual mode, service stopped and started with /usr/local/bin/pwnagotchi --debug directly, it works, loads AI and ran for more than 1h. If i boot it with power only it get stuck after 5-10 min...

		I have had similar problems: in my case the contents of the card were corrupted and upon restart (unplug + plug) the system was not loaded. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket&gt;@evilsocket&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and others have suggested that the cause could be an old / bad microsd, in fact it seems to be a common problem with the microsd cards used as secondary memory, due to frequent writing, as mentioned here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=36533&gt;https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=36533&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In my case I will try to buy a new micro sd, probably one of those with Application Performance class.. &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/application/index.html&gt;https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/application/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I hope I've helped

		I can load the system, the MANUAL mode works fine and longer than 10 min. The problem is the AUTO mode.

		I already switched sd cards, same behavior for both.

		<comment id='9' author='bitwave' date='2019-10-12T13:05:08Z'>
		I solved it using over_voltage=1 in the config.txt
Steps to solve:

Check power cable and power supply
Check SD card
use the above fix, see raspberrypi/linux#2555 (comment) for reference

Some models of the RPi0W have a H· on one of the coils, maybe these have problems.

		This should probably go in the docs somewhere?

		If you had the same problem &amp; solved it for you, probably yes.
