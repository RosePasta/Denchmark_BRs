		1.3.0 is known to have an update-bug. But I thought 1.4.1 is fine :/

		Hmm, funny you should mention that, I have experienced update problems on 1.4.1 too, mentioned in my comment on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/issues/731#issuecomment-568242913&gt;#731&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but I'm not sure if it's the same issue as described here. Anyway, I stopped services by systemd and updated all components manually as a workaround.

		Having update problems too, just won't update from 1.4.1 to 1.4.2. Had the same problem with 1.3.0.

		Looks like it needs to do some version checking on that line 214 in

/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/plugins/default/auto-update.py


https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/pwnagotchi/plugins/default/auto-update.py

instead of just

if num_installed &gt; 0:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def on_internet_available(self, agent):
.
.
                if num_installed &gt; 0:
                    display.update(force=True, new_data={'status': 'Rebooting ...'})
                    pwnagotchi.reboot()

            except Exception as e:
                logging.error("[update] %s" % e)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can you pleas explain what you mean by "updating all the components manually"?
