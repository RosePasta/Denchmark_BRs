	<summary>[BUG]    AI won't work after some time</summary>
	<description>
(edit: this was after I rebooted pwnagotchi many times)
After a time, the AI don't woks after a reboot:
"Error: the environment passed must have at least the same observation space as the model was trained on."
AssertionError: Error: the environment passed must have at least the same observation space as the model was trained on.
error message in log
[2020-11-08 13:32:25,025] [ERROR] error while starting AI (Error: the environment passed must have at least the same observation space as the model was trained on.)
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/ai/init.py", line 48, in load

[2020-11-08 13:32:25,035] [WARNING] [ai] AI not loaded!
I don't understand that...   A reboot didn't change anything, I flashed the image again, now same error.
What is wrong???
I didn't does anything...   I hope, you can help me

it says, creating new model, after created:

		are important AI files in brain.nn?
and what is this for a bug?

		after that it is running....
don't know if it learns or not...
after restart with pwnagotchi --skpi-sesion is saying creating model again
