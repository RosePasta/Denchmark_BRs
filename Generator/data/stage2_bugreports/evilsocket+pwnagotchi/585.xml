	<summary>Unable to access using Putty in Windows</summary>
	<description>
I have my computer set as 10.0.0.1, and I can see the web interface at 10.0.0.2, but I can't SSH to 10.0.0.2 using Putty. I get a 'Software caused connection abort' message.

		First a couple of questions:

Is the device still booting? As in, is the LED flashing?
What does "ipconfig /all" return? Your RNDIS interface should return 10.0.0.1 as IP.
What does "route print" return? Anything starting with 10.0.0.0 should point to the RNDIS interface.

		Thanks for the response!
It's finished booting, and working. Web address works, but only with 10.0.0.2, not pwnagotchi.local
ipconfig /all returns 10.0.0.1 as IP, 255.255.255.255 subnet, 0.0.0.0 gateway
Route Print returns:
10.0.0.0   255.255.255.0   On-Link   10.0.0.1
10.0.0.1   255.255.255.255   On-Link   10.0.0.1
