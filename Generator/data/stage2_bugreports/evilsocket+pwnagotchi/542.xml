	<summary>[BUG] plugin AircrackOnly - it seems to delete all the new handshakes</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I've ran the plugin for one week with v1.1.1 on a pi0 and I had the 99% of all new handshakes deleted.
I haven't checked by hand if all the new handshakes was really unvalid but it seems unlikely to me.
Is it a good idea to rely on aicrack to check if a pcap is valid??
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version 1.1.1
OS version
Type of hardware pi0

		I believe this issue has already been resolved in v1.2.1 (v1.2.1 has a new issue which prevents AircrackOnly plugin to load - This should be resolved in the next release)
Please see raised bug &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/issues/506&gt;#506&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I really liked the concept of the plugin and I would love to see it stay.. as I mentioned on my previous comment, all issues up to now should be resolved in the next release since this bug references an older version.. but it's your project and the final decision...

		I'm just moving some of the plugins in a separate repositories of user contributed plugins, so we don't have to fix issues created by broken plugins in the core.
Also, let me reiterate: relying on aircrack only to filter handshakes will delete a bunch of good pcap files that you might crack with hashcat.
The assumption that aircrack can properly filter that stuff is wrong, it misses a lot of stuff.
