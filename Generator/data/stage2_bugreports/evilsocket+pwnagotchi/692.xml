	<summary>error while loading Wpa-sec.py[BUG]</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Ive realized that my  pwnagitchi has not been uploading any new handshakes to wpa-sec.stanev.org for about a week or so.  I just noticed this in the log on start up:
pwnagotchi-launcher[3548]: [2019-12-05 05:03:07,860] [WARNING] error while loading /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/plugins/default/wpa-sec.py: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 16434 (char 16433)
Any ideas what is going on here?   It worked before, after going to 1.3.0.    As far as I know I made no changes to any to the wpa-sec.py files.   My config did get wiped in a webcfg error, but I restored it
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

restart pwnagotchi
observe logs

Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version 1.3.0
waveshare v2, upslite,
bluetooth gps connected on dev/rfcomm1

		This happens when the tracking file is corrupted. This should be fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/pull/664&gt;#664&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
