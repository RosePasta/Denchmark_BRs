	<summary>[BUG] Pwnagotchi does not initiate association/deauthing as expected in AUTO mode.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
pwnagotchi does not initiate association/deauthing as expected in AUTO mode, this issue started happening from 1.4.1 (I have not used 1.4.0). Version &lt;=1.3.1 was fine
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Either boot into AUTO from MANU, or go straight into AUTO from plugging into power
Wait for AUTO to start
Be disappointed

Expected behavior
After looking around and waiting, supposedly AUTO will start associating/deauthing as usual.
However, there's an endless loop of waiting-&gt;looking around-&gt;waiting. After ~15m of waiting, AI mode would start and the box would function as expected - but only in AI mode.
Screenshots
N/A
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: 1.4.1
OS version: Windows 10
Type of hardware: RPI0W
Any additional hardware used: 2.13in paper HAT

Additional context
Please let me know if you need anything from the log

		Should be fixed in: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/commit/dbb64e0fabb3df3d6886b075c1079f607a0142e2&gt;dbb64e0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is not included in 1.4.1 yet.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evilsocket&gt;@evilsocket&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 maybe tag 1.4.2?
