	<summary>[BUG] Auto-Backup fails if one of the files is missing</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I'm not sure, how this situation came up but I don't have a .api-report.json file in /root and the auto-backup plugin therefor fails.
Probably it should check for each file first and only backup those files, that exist?
Other question: What should the api-report.json contain?
To Reproduce

delete /root/.api-report.json
activate auto-backup
see failure

Expected behavior
Only existing files are backuped
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version: 1.0.1

Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.

		Well, the plugin just executes the commands its given. We should change the default files to files which are 100% there. Api report is only there if the grid plugin is enabled..

		thx for the info. I created a PR which adds a simple check, if the file exists. I think this is a clear solution.
