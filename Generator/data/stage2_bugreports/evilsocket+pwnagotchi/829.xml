	<summary>[BUG] Web UI changes not saved - Rp 3B+</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
On the rasperry pi 3b+, after a fresh install + update, the web ui won't save changes I make.
( my fresh install booted without lan cable pluged in the first time, not sure if it matters)
To Reproduce
I tried the following in MANU mode and AUTO mode, just to see if that changes anything (same result though) :

I accessed the web ui through 192.168.0.102:8080
Went to plugin tab.
Enabled the webcfg (couldnt click it until I switched to another tab and came back)
Made changes (added bt mac and set option for this to true)
Saved my changes
Putty ssh -&gt; 192.168.0.102:22
login
sudo su
nano /etc/pwnagotchi/config.yml
The file is the same as it was at first boot (i used the default; as shown in "Usage" section)

Expected behavior
Changes saved to config.yml
Environment (please complete the following information):

Pwnagotchi version (pwnver is broken so not sure, but I just did a git pull + pip3 install)
Raspberry pi 3b +

		If you pulled latest source from the repo you will be using toml config not yaml. Edit /etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml instead.

		Ah gotcha, I see the thread about it now. Thanks for the info, I'll see if I can get bt-tether enabled in the toml then

		This means that the webcfg plugin is not rewritten for the new format, i think.
Switching to toml will create many problems and misunderstandings at the beginning. Need to change not only the instructions for users, but also rewrite the plugins...
