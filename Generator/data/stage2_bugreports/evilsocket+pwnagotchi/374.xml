	<summary>[BUG] pwnagotchi.ai accessible with and w/o www causing CORS issues</summary>
	<description>

Currently pwnagotchi.ai is accessible both with and w/o &lt;denchmark-link:http://www&gt;www&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. This causes some issues with CORS as the same origin does not work when using &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.pwnagotchi.ai&gt;www.pwnagotchi.ai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Steps to reproduce the behavior:

open https://www.pwnagotchi.ai/map/ =&gt; see CORS errors in console, no map
open https://pwnagotchi.ai/map/ =&gt; profit

Expected behavior
I'd expect to only have one version of the page (most likely without www). This would also prevent any search engine penalties due to duplicate content.
