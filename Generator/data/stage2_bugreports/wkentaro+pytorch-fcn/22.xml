Hi,
When I run the examples/voc/train_fcn32s.py.  There is a strange error
File "train_fcn32s.py", line 46, in main
model = torchfcn.models.FCN32s(n_class=21, deconv=deconv)
TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'deconv'
could you tell me what's wrong with this error?
Thanks and Best Regards,
