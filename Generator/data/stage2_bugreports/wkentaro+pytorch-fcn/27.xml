Hi,
Thanks so much for your help!    I'm new to pytorch.
There is a new error again!
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "examples/voc/train_fcn32s.py", line 100, in 
main()
File "examples/voc/train_fcn32s.py", line 56, in main
model.copy_params_from_vgg16(vgg16, init_upscore=False)

AttributeError: 'Dropout' object has no attribute 'weight'
Thanks and Best Regards,
