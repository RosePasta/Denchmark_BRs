	<description>
Why is a lot of memory (~11G) consumed after importing torchfcn? And because of this, I am not able to run the training demo due to out of memory. How could this happen?

		I mean GPU memory &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wkentaro&gt;@wkentaro&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks for your help.
I found the reason. The GPU gets engaged after importing chainer (theano). I changed the configuration of theano to disable cuda. Then everything goes fine.
