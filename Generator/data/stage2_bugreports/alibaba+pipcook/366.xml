	<summary>cli, plugin: fail to install plugins from local path</summary>
	<description>
When trying to install plugins from local paths using:
pipcook plugin install ./packages/plugins/model-evaluate/text-creation-tfjs-model-evaluate
it will throw an error like:
â„¹ pipcook-plugins-text-creation-tfjs-model-evaluate-1.0.3.tgz

(node:5198) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Request failed with status code 404
indicating a missing of tgz file.
I think we should set a mechanism that detects the input and if it is a relative address, we will read the dir rather than treating it as a plugin from npm or we should manually pack the folder into a tgz file.
