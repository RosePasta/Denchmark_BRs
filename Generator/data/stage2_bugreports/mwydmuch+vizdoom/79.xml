		The one way to deal with the same location problem is customize  function in .  To be precise, when a player spawn &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Marqt/ViZDoom/blob/master/src/vizdoom/src/g_game.cpp#L1630&gt;at level start&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
This issue relates to the telefrag feature. Whether it will be used for CIG competition?

		Actually we don't care that much. Telefraging is doom specific and is regonized by the system so it will stay.
