		The Cocoa backend for Mac doesn't appear to support window hiding.
As a workaround you can install sdl2 (brew install sdl2) and build VizDoom using the SDL2 backend with the cmake flag -DOSX_COCOA_BACKEND=OFF

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jietang&gt;@jietang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for finding that option - OSX_COCOA_BACKEND is OFF by default now.
 should work with SDL2 backend - can anyone confirm?
And Windows has been fixed - thanks for info &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rex8312&gt;@rex8312&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I will prepare new bin release soon.
