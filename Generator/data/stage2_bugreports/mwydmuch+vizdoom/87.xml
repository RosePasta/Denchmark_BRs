	<summary>ViZDoom crash when MOVE_FORWARD button pressed</summary>
	<description>
I'm using ViZDoom 1.0.3 and 1.1.0pre in Windows 10.
When after AI hit the button MOVE_FORWARD, game crashed with this message.
"ViZDoomUnexpectedExitException: Controlled ViZDoom instance exited unexpectedly."
It happen when I try to run shaping.py.
MOVE_BACKWARD or MOVE_FORWARD_BACKWARD_DELTA is working.

		Yes, it happens not only for shaping.py but generally when using MOVE_FORWARD. It works ok on Linux though.

		I think it is the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/issues/74&gt;#74&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it should now work correctly in new 1.1.0pre build (it has been updated) and in 1.0.4 version.

		I see, probably, I have some mistake while update ViZDoom.
It's work after update again. Thanks.
