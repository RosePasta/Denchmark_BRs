	<summary>ViziaMain.newEpisode() hangs when it's called straight after init</summary>
	<description>
this is ok:
v-&gt;init();
v-&gt;makeAction(action);
v-&gt;newEpisode();
this is bad:
v-&gt;init();
v-&gt;newEpisode();
it hangs here

		Update:
The bug is more serious because makeAction/newEpisode seems to hang ocasionally. Reproducible in python and c++. Run example.py or mainExample and wait, it should stop. I suspect that it's the same bug.

		Well, calling newEpisode() after init is fixed now and also this fix should make restarting more reliable. I can't reproduce bug with occasionally hang just letting it run, it works good for me. But I have noticed that it sometimes hang on mouse input in doom window, then map restart due to End_Normal(0) can be interrupted (by this input?). Temporary (or not) I have added restart reattempt if it takes to long.
