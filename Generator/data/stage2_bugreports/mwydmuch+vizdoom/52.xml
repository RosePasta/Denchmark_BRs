	<summary>Unexpected jumping behavior when running `cig_host.py`</summary>
	<description>
I just installed ViZDoom on my mac os laptop. I can run bin/vizdoom without any strange behavior, but when I run examples/python/cig_host.py and cig.py the player controlled by the host script jumps and moves uncontrollably. The player controlled by cig.py works just fine.
I cannot recreate this behavior on my linux machine.
Also, I can fix this behavior by fiddling with:
game.add_game_args(), but it seems to be more related to the number of flags, than the flags themselves... This is very puzzling to me.
Any ideas what is going on?

		At the moment, I can only confirm this strange behavior on OSX. The bot
should not jump at all, in the first place. It also behaves similarly in
ASYNC_SPECTATOR mode as if some buttons were constantly pressed.
I also confirm that the problem disappears when only 4 commands (in total,
independent on the number of calls) are added via the add_game_args(). 5th
command (even a repeated one) causes troubles.

		It'll be hard to check without macs... Anyway maybe something went  wrong with key mappings somehow. Could you try making this  'game.make_action([0])' to check if being idle also results in this crazy jumping?

		I started having this problem two weeks ago. Any idea what triggers this bug?

		Not really, w don't generally use macs so it was hard to find it and then ...it disappeared after some commit. I assume that you are using an up-to-date version and the bug is back :(?

 Which version/commit are you using? Has the bug started occurring after pull/version update?

		I am using the latest version. Yeah, it has occurred even after I pulled the latest version. Its specifically occurring in cig_bots.py

		I cannot confirm it at the moment because my mac is broken but I was pretty
sure that this problem has stopped occurring some time ago.
