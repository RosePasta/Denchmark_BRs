		Not only it leaks memory, it seems closing and re-initing DoomGame instance does not release this memory , nor does creating a completely new DoomGame instance in same process.
My current work-around is to completely kill Process objects holding the DoomGame objects and create new Processes when using multiprocessing to run multiple DoomGame instances in parallel.
