	<summary>vizdoom 1.1.5, out of sync</summary>
	<description>
I am using two physical machines. With this configurations:
1.
game.add_game_args("-host 2 -deathmatch +timelimit 10.0 " "+sv_forcerespawn 1 +sv_noautoaim 1 +sv_respawnprotect 1 +sv_spp awnfarthest 1 +sv_nocrouch 1 " "+viz_respawn_delay 10 +viz_nocheat 1")
2.
game.add_game_args("-join 192.168.0.19")
Both machines configured as mode = ASYNC_PLAYER
Less then 1 minutes after the game started, both consols always show message like "out of sync with player xxx"
I have tried both wireless and physical cable.
Thanks!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wzbbbb&gt;@wzbbbb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for reporting!
It looks like the current master has some problems with synchronous multiplayer. I will investigate it later.
Right now you can try 1.1.4 version that should work or use async mode, where the game is processed at constant speed.
Use  to change mode to async and then  can be used to set processing speed.

		I am fine with the 1.1.5, too lazy to switch back. :)
I did not set the ticrate, hope the default rate is used during the match.

		Yes, default ticrate is just normal game speed, we used it in our competitions.

		Can't replicate the issue any more with current master, both async and sync multiplayer seems to work correctly. I'm closing this one for now.
