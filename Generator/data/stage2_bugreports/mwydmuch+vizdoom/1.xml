	<summary>ViziaMain/DoomController: newEpisode() doesn't work correctly</summary>
	<description>
After calling newEpisode() (when isEpisodeFinished()) the new episode is not really created (it seems). IsEpisodeFinished() still returns true (for one tic) and returns some crappy reward.
To see it run example.y or mainExample.

		It was not a bug, it was an feature! Anyway, map restarting function has been rewritten. Now it waits for complete map restart in doom. After calling newEpisode() new state from very first tic of restarted map is waiting for You :)
