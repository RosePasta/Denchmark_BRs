	<summary>Untraced call to a gen function should sample from the generative distribution, and not use generate</summary>
	<description>
An untraced call to a gen function should sample from its generative distribution p (e.g. which is sampled from by propose), and not q (which is sampled from by generate). Although in the most typical case this q is identical to the p when there are no constraints on generate, it is not always.

		Nice -- I was wondering about this. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vkmvkmvkmvkm&gt;@vkmvkmvkmvkm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this is related to the question of whether a Metaprob , when called from Clojure, should invoke the implementation and throw away the score (as it does currently), or just invoke the model.
