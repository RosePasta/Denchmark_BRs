	<summary>Propose for static DSL is actually implemented in terms of generate</summary>
	<description>
The real propose for the static IR generative functions is simply not yet implemented, but as a workaround for common cases, it currently calls generate. However, in the presence of custom generative functions that use custom internal proposals (e.g. a nested particle filter for use in particle MCMC), this will give wrong weights.
