	<summary>The currently syntax rules mistakenly enables TO TRAIN without SELECT</summary>
	<description>
The current syntax rules in sql.y are as follows:



sqlflow/pkg/sql/sql.y


        Lines 188 to 207
      in
      d0db43b






 | train_clause opt_semicolon { // FIXME(tony): remove above rules that include select clause 



 	parseResult = &amp;extendedSelect{ 



 		extended: true, 



 		train: true, 



 		trainClause: $1} 



   } 



 | predict_clause opt_semicolon { 



 	parseResult = &amp;extendedSelect{ 



 		extended: true, 



 		train: false, 



 		predictClause: $1} 



   } 



 | explain_clause opt_semicolon { 



 	parseResult = &amp;extendedSelect{ 



 		extended: true, 



 		train: false, 



 		analyze: true, 



 		explainClause: $1} 



 } 



 ; 





These rules accept the TO TRAIN/PREDICT/EXPLAIN clauses without the prefixed SELECT statement. This is not our design.

		This is what we are expecting for now, and will only accept SQLs start from TO TRAIN ... later, because:

we use the third-party parser to split standard SQL and extended SQL, if the statement is extended SQL, we will pass the extended part from TO TRAIN to sql.y and check the grammar of the standard SQL.
for backward compatibility, we kept accepting the full extended SQL and it's currently not used currently, will be removed later .
