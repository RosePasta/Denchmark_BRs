	<summary>The fraud detection notebook doesn't run</summary>
	<description>
The first SELECT * LIMIT 5 statement runs. But the rest statements with SQLFlow syntax extensions do not run. As shown in the following figure.

To reporduce this problem:

Follow the Quick Start guide in Windows to start a container.
Open a Chrome and direct to localhost:8888. This opens the list of notebooks. Select the fraud detection example.
Run cells one-by-one. The first runs and prints some sample data. The rest don't give any response.

Please be aware that I can run the Housing Explain example &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8888/notebooks/housing-explain.ipynb&gt;http://localhost:8888/notebooks/housing-explain.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The mark [*] on the left of the SQL statements block means this block is currently still running. And, [1] means the first execution is completed. You may need to wait until the execution is finished.
