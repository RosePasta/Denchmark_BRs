Description
I download the sqlflow-release-0.1 branch. I try to build server from source code without docker.
When i run go generate ./... command, it could transfer server/proto/sqlflow.proto into sqlflow.pb.go. However the proto.RegisterSQLFlowServer can not be resolved in cmd/sqlflowserver/main.go. I have look up the sqlflow.pb.go file, there is no RegisterSQLFlowServer method defined. please help.

		What's the version of protobuf (protoc) installed on your machine, and what version is your Go compiler?

 shall we make generated proto files part of our source files? I received similar complaints from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/samplise&gt;@samplise&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 when he is trying out  while finding it hard to do .

 I don't think so. We only provide a docker container as the build environment, in case that the dependencies are updated, e.g. we must include JDK 1.8 to compile the parser. We recommend users to compile SQLFlow binaries using this Docker image so that it can be ported to any environment.
So, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gxf1986&gt;@gxf1986&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please use the Docker image  to build the binaries and copy them into you runtime environment for deployment? It's the best way to compile SQLFlow.

 .
Sorry &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gxf1986&gt;@gxf1986&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we don't have enough manpower to support native build. Please use docker. Thanks.
