	<summary>Incorrect model evaluation results in xgboost</summary>
	<description>
During xgboost  model training, when setting the validation set, the evaluation result of the validation set is the same as the training set.
The reproducing procedure is shown as follows:
%%sqlflow
SELECT * FROM boston.train
TO TRAIN xgboost.gbtree
WITH
    objective="reg:squarederror",
    train.num_boost_round = 20,
    validation.select = "select * from boston.test;"
LABEL medv
INTO sqlflow_models.my_xgb_regression_model;

The output message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[0]	train-rmse:17.1167	validate-rmse:17.1167

		Thanks for your reporting, it's a bug for the XGBoost validation, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sql-machine-learning/sqlflow/pull/1891&gt;#1891&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 would fix it and add some convergence test.
