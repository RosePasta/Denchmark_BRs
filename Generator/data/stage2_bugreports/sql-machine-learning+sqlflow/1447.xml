	<summary>Recursive call in parse() might overflow the stack</summary>
	<description>
The function parse in /pkg/sql/parse.go uses the recursion as a loop.



sqlflow/pkg/sql/parse.go


         Line 106
      in
      69c5fe8






 nextSqls, err := parse(dbms, sqlProgram) 





The recursion would grow the stack size up to the number of statements in an SQL program.  If the SQL program is long enough, this recursive would overflow the stack and crash the SQLFlow server.
We need to replace it with a real loop.
