	<summary>Model Zoo releases a second model with the same name would overwrite the first released model</summary>
	<description>
Suppose that we have trained a model with some hyperparameters and released it to the SQLFlow model zoo with the tag v0.1 and the name my_model:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sqlflow release model my_model v0.1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then we train the model with other hyperparameters and release the trained model with a different tag v0.2 but the same name my_model.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sqlflow release model my_model v0.2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The latter released model would overwrite the former one even though the tag is different (v0.1 vs v0.2).
This bug should be fixed.
