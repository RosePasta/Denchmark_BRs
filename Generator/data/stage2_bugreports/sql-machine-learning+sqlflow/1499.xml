	<summary>Training will still start and successfully run when specified label not in the table</summary>

Training SQL:
SELECT * FROM housing.train
TO TRAIN DNNRegressor
WITH
  model.hidden_units=[128,32],
  train.epoch = 20,
  train.batch_size=4,
  validation.select="select * from housing.test"
LABEL class
INTO sqlflow_models.my_reg_model;
Yet the LABEL class is not in housing.train table, it should be target, but the above SQL can still run.
