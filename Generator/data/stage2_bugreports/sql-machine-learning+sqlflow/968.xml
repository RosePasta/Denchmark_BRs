%autoreload not found. I am not sure about the cause.
File not found: 'sql/python/test_magic.py  due to the directory sql/python is outdated.

		For 1, the  went away after I load  manually as suggested &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/36573286&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
For 2, you are right. The directory is outdated.
After fixing them, we have

I haven't found a solution to make it return 1.
