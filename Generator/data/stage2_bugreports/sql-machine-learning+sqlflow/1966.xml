	<summary>Bad substitution error on SQL statement contains ${}</summary>
	<description>
Description
If a SQL statement contains ${}, for example
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- ${internal.config}
select 1;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In the workflow mode, the job will fail with the following error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;bash: -- ${internal.config}
select 1;: bad substitution
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Reproduction Steps
Execute the above example.
Root Cause
The workflow YAML produced by this SQL is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;container:
  command:
    - bash
    - '-c'
    - "repl -e \"-- ${internal.config}\nselect 1;\" "
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the workflow consider this as
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;bash -c repl -e "-- ${internal.config} select 1;"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So the bash command in the container tries to substitute ${internal.config}. However, according to the bash man page
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;   name   A  word  consisting  only  of alphanumeric characters and under‐
          scores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an  under‐
          score.  Also referred to as an identifier.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So the name  with dot is illegal, then  raises . &lt;denchmark-link:https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/93533&gt;ref&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Does the repl need to do substituting?
If not, shall we change " to '(a single-quote)?
///
update:
~ ➜ bash -c 'echo ${a.b}' 
bash: ${a.b}: bad substitution
It looks like the single-quote does not fix the problem. Let's find another way out.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tonyyang-svail&gt;@tonyyang-svail&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's exhaustive analyze, it seems that  is not the bash standard:
➜  sqlflow (develop) ✗ bash -c "echo ${internal}"
➜  sqlflow (develop) ✗ bash -c "echo ${internal.aa}"
zsh: bad substitution
how about update the workflow: remove bash -c ?

Agreed. repl is a standalone program.
