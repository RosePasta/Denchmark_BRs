To Author:
I tried to edit the finetune "feedback" data. However, I got the following error. I have tried to release the cache but still can not work. Do you have any idea? Thank you!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/laifuchicago&gt;@laifuchicago&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you provide more details as to when you get this error? Do you get this when exporting the "feedback"?
It seems like a query is returning huge amount of data, causing the request to break.

I got this error when exporting the feedback. Is there a way to delete that one?

, yes you can delete the current feedback index in Elasticsearch.  Here's a code snippet you could use:
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
client = Elasticsearch(hosts=[{"host": HOST, "port": PORT}], http_auth=(USERNAME, PASSWORD))
client.indices.delete(index="feedback", ignore=[404])
In the current feedback export, the entire document(corresponding to a "feedback") gets exported as "context", thus bloating up the response size. To make it scalable, we plan to make the size of the "context" configurable in the API. I'll update here when we have an implementation for it.
