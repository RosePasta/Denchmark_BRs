I am using Elastic search 7.6.2, Python 3.7, farm-haystack==0.4.0
I am facing this error while deploying the model with Rasa.
I am also running Elasticsearch in dedicated container.
I am using Tutorial 4 with my own FAQ data. Please refer this link for idea

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Gourav-infobiz&gt;@Gourav-infobiz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Happy to help here, but can you please format your issue and give some additional context? You can either use our "Bug Template" or adjust your issue here in the following points:

Short, descriptive title for the issue (e.g "ElasticsearchDeprecationWarning: The vector functions of the form function(query, doc['field']) are deprecated")
No screenshots of logs but the actual text (this will help others to find the issue better if they face similar problems and it simplifies our debugging in many cases as we can copy&amp;paste)
Quick description of when this warning appears and your environment (What Haystack components are used? What retriever model? What Haystack version? What elasticsearch version? ...)

This will help us to help you in a faster way and others in the community will benefit more easily from this. Thanks!

		Ok, can you please install the latest Haystack version (0.5.0) and see if you still get the deprecation warning?
This should have been fixed a while ago with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/commit/db4151bbc026f27c6d709fefef1088cd3f1e18b9&gt;db4151b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

FYI: In any case, this deprecation warning should not impact any of your results. It will only cause trouble if you update to a more recent Elasticsearch version.

		Seems to be fixed. Feel free to re-open if you still see the deprecation warning in the latest Haystack version.
