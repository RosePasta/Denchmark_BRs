	<summary>Appearance of unknown questions in my Deepset Annotator project</summary>
	<description>
Today, I was trying to create QA labels in my annotator project. I have encountered following errors:-


Not able to create QA label, it displays an error message 'Validation error'.


Secondly, I saw a list of questions in German language (correct me if I am wrong) in the list of questions of my project. For your reference I am including the screenshots of the list of unknown questions. I believe there are around 2000+ German Questions.

		This is a serious bug and we are working to fix it asap. Thanks for reporting.
It is likely introduced with the update of the annotation tool today that should have fixed the problems you mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/issues/335&gt;#335&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We have found and eliminated the source of the problem. The questions should not be visible any longer.
These German questions were inserted by us in a very special way to test out some new features. Any question (or other data) you or other users created should not have been affected.
Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
