	<summary>Deep Annotation Tool Offsets on Windows</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When using the Labeling Tool "Deep Annotation" on Windows there were offsets within the labeled answers. When I selected an answer to a question and then viewed the answer in the "Export Labels" tab, the answer there differed from the text that I had selected.
For example: I selected  "vor ca. 40 Mio. Jahren" and the answer in the Export Labels tab is "igoz√§n (vor ca. 40 Mio".
This behavior only occurred with the text files I created myself. When using other text files, e.g. files from the Haystack Tutorial 1 (Game of Thrones Texts), the labels were correct.
Solution:
After comparing the text files I created with the GOT text files, I noticed that the line break type from the GOT files were "LF" while the line separator in my files was "CRLF". So I simply changed the line break type in my text editor to "LF" and now everything works just fine.
System:

OS: Windows

		Thanks for adding the detailed bug description &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sophgit&gt;@sophgit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We already created a fix that should convert windows, MacOS and Unix txt files into a single format. We are currently testing the changes on our staging server and will let you know once they are on the production system.
