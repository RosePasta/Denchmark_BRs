	<summary>Add additional meta fields for FAQ-QA APIs</summary>
	<description>
I couldn't figure out how to get additional meta fields also returned in the results response.
Currently, the results object contains
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;question, 
answers.answer
answers.question
answer.probability
...

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

How do I get other fields from the same document? I think that should come under "meta" but I am not aware of how to specify that? Is there any environment variable?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sonnylaskar&gt;@sonnylaskar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the metadata is now added by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pull/106&gt;#106&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for FAQ-QA APIs.
