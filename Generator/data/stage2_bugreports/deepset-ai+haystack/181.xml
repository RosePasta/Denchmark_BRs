To author:
I have tried your Tutorial6 about DPR already, but got this error below. Do you have any suggestions?

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/laifuchicago&gt;@laifuchicago&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Seems more related to the FARMReader than DPR or anything new in the Tutorial.
Let's try to nail this bug down:

What version of FARM are you running?
How many cores do you have on this machine? Is it maybe a small single CPU machine?

In any case, you can work around this exception by disabling multiprocessing.
You can do that via:
reader = FARMReader(model_name_or_path="deepset/roberta-base-squad2", use_gpu=False, num_processes=0)
However, it would be helpful to find the root cause here and fixing it.
