	<summary>RAG Predict throwing an error when using a GPU</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I have no issue creating the generator, but creating it with use_gpu on will lead to an error when attempting to predict. Note that I have no issues with the FARMReader when using a gpu.
Error message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Inferencing Samples: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00&lt;00:00, 56.41 Batches/s]

    237         doc_scores = torch.bmm(question_embedding.unsqueeze(1),

RuntimeError: Expected object of device type cuda but got device type cpu for argument #0 'result' in call to _th_bmm_out
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Additional context
This is in google colab, I can't test this anywhere else as I don't have access to a GPU.
I did make sure to setup torch at the top:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!pip install urllib3==1.25.4 
!pip install torch==1.6.0+cu101 torchvision==0.6.1+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Without this torch update, it doesn't throw the error, but it doesn't appear to be using the GPU as it greatly improves the speed of the DPR (Which also has use_gpu on).
To Reproduce
Should be able to reproduce by taking the RAG tutorial and flipping off to on for use_gpu
System:

OS: Google Colab
GPU/CPU: Colab GPU
Haystack version (commit or version number): Latest
DocumentStore: FAISSDocumentStore
Retriever: DensePassageRetriever

		Thanks for reporting &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rshtirmer&gt;@rshtirmer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
Seems like one of the tensors is still on the CPU. We'lll look into this.
