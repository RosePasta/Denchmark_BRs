		Are you by any chance using farm-haystack==0.4.0 here (as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/issues/662&gt;#662&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)? If yes, please update to haystack 0.5.0, elasticsearch 7.9.2 and verify if this bug persists. Thanks!

		Ok, thanks for the update. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/brandenchan&gt;@brandenchan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will investigate this in the next days.
If you have an example (i.e. document + query + used embedding model) where this probability &gt; 100% happens, it would accelerate his debugging work a lot.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Gourav-infobiz&gt;@Gourav-infobiz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this issue was coming up due to a bug in the scaling functions that convert similarity scores to probabilities. I have been working on this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pull/667&gt;#667&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Would you like to try it out? If you pull the new branch called  you can try the changes. Otherwise they should be merged in to master very soon.

Hi @Gourav-infobiz, this issue was coming up due to a bug in the scaling functions that convert similarity scores to probabilities. I have been working on this in #667. Would you like to try it out? If you pull the new branch called scale_prob you can try the changes. Otherwise they should be merged in to master very soon.

Thanks for the response! Ok will check the same.
