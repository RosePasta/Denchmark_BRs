		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/thiagomoeng&gt;@thiagomoeng&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Seems like your Reader object was not correctly initialized. Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce this bug on my machine.
How did you install haystack?
Can you please verify that you installed from latest master branch via:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git
cd haystack
pip install --editable .
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If you still face the same error, please post the additional logs that you get before this error message.
