	<summary>Connect to Elasticsearch (ConnectionRefusedError)</summary>
	<description>
Whenever I am connecting to Elasticsearch (on colab), I get this error
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
What's the fix for this?
Thanks.

		Hey,
Do you wait ~30-40 seconds after starting elasticsearch? It sometimes needs a bit to load and become available for external queries.

		Do you mean programmatically wait?
because I have ! sleep 30 which I assume does that already

		<comment id='3' author='Freemanlabs' date='2020-11-24T17:16:49Z'>
		Yes, that should be fine. Can you share the exact colab notebook here (e.g a link), so that I can reproduce this?

Now I cannot even start the server - permission denied. I have toggled between
os.setuid(1) (The default from the tutorial which never worked)
os.setuid(0) or `os.setuid(os.getuid()) (which has been working, but not anymore)

		Seems like the outdated urlib version on Colab was causing your trouble.
After adding !pip install urllib3==1.25.4 it seems fine. Please verify.
We already had this cmd in our tutorials, but we should probably make this a hard requirement

		No Please. It isn't working still

		Hmm... have you tried with the orginal code for os.setuid(1) from the tutorial?
When I run your notebook with :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# In Colab / No Docker environments: Start Elasticsearch from source
### UNCOMMENT BLOCK TO RUN FOR THE FIRST TIME ###
! wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.6.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -q
! tar -xzf elasticsearch-7.6.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
! chown -R daemon:daemon elasticsearch-7.6.2
### END OF BLOCK ###

import os
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT
es_server = Popen(['elasticsearch-7.6.2/bin/elasticsearch'],
                   stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT,
                   preexec_fn=lambda: os.setuid(1)  # as daemon
                  )
# wait until ES has started
! sleep 40

from haystack.document_store.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchDocumentStore
document_store = ElasticsearchDocumentStore(host="localhost", username="", password="", index="document")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It connects successfully to elastic and logs:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;11/25/2020 08:54:31 - INFO - elasticsearch -   PUT http://localhost:9200/document [status:200 request:0.375s]
11/25/2020 08:54:32 - INFO - elasticsearch -   PUT http://localhost:9200/label [status:200 request:0.205s]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I can't tell what could be happening right now.
os.setuid(1) doesn't work for me. Says permission denied. os.setuid(0) works.
however, it's still refusing connection to Elasticsearch

		I tried again, but unfortunately I can't replicate your problem. Maybe try to reset your notebook and run the above code (with os.setuid(1) and urllib3==1.25.4)?
		</comment>
		<comment id='10' author='Freemanlabs' date='2020-11-25T16:14:33Z'>
		Well, the error still persists.
Did you try on my shared notebook, because I couldn't see any changes? I noticed the first one but your last trial.
		</comment>
		<comment id='11' author='Freemanlabs' date='2020-11-30T10:48:56Z'>
		Yes, I changed   and installed urllib3==1.25.4.
I just tried the notebook again and it works like a charm on my end. Are you sure you are running &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TInRsx0G7lPB_hGJCIUIBtFcMFzDrZW4?usp=sharing#scrollTo=X2sMwwe9IhUK&gt;this notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the exact same manner without adding changes from your side?
(I obviously did not load your mounted gdrive, but started execution from cell 3)

		<comment id='12' author='Freemanlabs' date='2020-11-30T11:06:42Z'>
		So that's the issue exactly.
when I mount gdrive and cd to a directory, os.setuid(1) gives permission denied error, `os.setuid(0) works but gives connectionRefusedError.
when I do not mount any drive, all works like a charm as you said.
The problem is since I cannot mount a drive and download elasticsearch permanently to a directory, I have to download and extract elastic search each time I restart my notebook or runtime restarts.

		Ok, but then this is really not a Haystack specific issue. Seems rather like a colab issue of mounting the drive and giving correct access permissions. I am unfortunately no Colab expert and mostly develop in IDEs. How about posting a question on stack overflow (as described &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools#contacting-us&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) or create an issue in their GitHub repo? I would only make sure to describe the problem as minimal as possible. From my understanding mounting the drive, then downloading elasticsearch and then running it yields the permission denied error.

		Seems resolved. Closing now. Feel free to reopen.
