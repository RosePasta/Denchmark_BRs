	<summary>ImportError: No module named theano_utils for elephas_optimizer import</summary>
	<description>
First, thanks for the bringing Keras to Spark.
Seems very interesting.
I'm trying to implement the example from the README.md but I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "..pathToFile/File.py", line 12, in 
from elephas import optimizers as elephas_optimizers
File "/Users/XXX/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/elephas/optimizers.py", line 11, in 
from keras.utils.theano_utils import shared_zeros, shared_scalar, floatX
ImportError: No module named theano_utils
I also tried changing keras backend to TensorFlow. However Elephas is still looking (and cannot find) "theano_utils".
Any ideas on why this doesn't work?
Thanks

		Yes, you're absolutely right, thanks for this. The reason this breaks is that the latest release of Keras, introducing backends, removed the file theano_utils, as it is backend-specific. I will fix this and make a new minor release as soon as I find the time. Until then, would you please consider using Keras version 0.2.0 to run the example?
Then this one should work for you:

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mitomm&gt;@mitomm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, just released elephas 0.2.2 to revolve all theano/backend related issues. Does this work as expected for you?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/maxpumperla&gt;@maxpumperla&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, yes, the error is gone now. Thanks for the quick fix.
