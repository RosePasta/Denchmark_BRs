	<summary>DualIAATransform doesn't implement separate mask transform</summary>
	<description>
I'd like to use IAAAffine and IAAPerspective to augment images for segmentation. I have the label masks one-hot encoded as 8-bit values, and the missing mask-only transform from DualIAATransform interpolates the values in the the label masks, making them invalid (i.e. more than one bit set for a given pixel)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/akojo&gt;@akojo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can you please specify version of  you're using and short snippet to reproduce it?

		Closing due to inactivity. Since we added unit tests to ensure transformation does not introduce new classes for masks, it should be fine now.
