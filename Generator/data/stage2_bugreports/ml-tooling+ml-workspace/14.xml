	<summary>Build is failing for jupyter lab theme</summary>
	<description>
when I try running jupyter labextension install @oriolmirosa/jupyterlab_materialdarker it installs perfectly but fails to build. Any comments on that? BTW here are the logs for that:

		Seems like its a docker resources issue. Able to resolve it by increasing memory from 4 GB to 8 GB.

		Thanks for figuring this out. I'm planning to add something to the known problems section on our Readme about this issue with memory and I will do some tests on figuring out the minimum suggested memory.
