	<summary>Updating vscode results in redirect</summary>
	<description>
I updated vscode from it's UI  and now I always get  redirected to localhost/login which is not a valid URL, all the other tools work fine, but not VScode. Any ideas how to  debug or  reset it?

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/feribg&gt;@feribg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
thanks for reporting the issue! We have just looked into the issue and it looks like one of the flags for code-server has changed.
For a quick fix, please try out following by executing the lines in your workspace's terminal:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sed -i "s/--no-auth/--auth none/g" /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf
supervisorctl reload
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It replaces the old flag with the new flag and restarts supervisor.
Afterwards, you should be able to access vscode again.
Please let us know whether this works for you!

		Thanks, works! Required full restart of the container not just supervisor reload in case others are trying.
