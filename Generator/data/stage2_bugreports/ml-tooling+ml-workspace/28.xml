	<summary>Docker image does not build</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug:
When I build the image with docker, I get errors.
I run the following command inside the project root folder:
docker image build -t ml-workspace .
After a while I get the error at step 50/97:
RuntimeError: JupyterLab failed to build
Expected behaviour:
Success build.
Steps to reproduce the issue:
I run the following command inside the project root folder:
docker image build -t ml-workspace .
After a while I get the error at step 50/97:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Step 50/97 : RUN     jupyter lab build &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager &amp;&amp;     if [ "$WORKSPACE_FLAVOR" = "minimal" ]; then         jupyter lab clean &amp;&amp;         jlpm cache clean &amp;&amp;         rm -rf $CONDA_DIR/share/jupyter/lab/staging &amp;&amp;         clean-layer.sh &amp;&amp;         exit 0 ;     fi &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/toc &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_tensorboard &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/git &amp;&amp;     pip install jupyterlab-git &amp;&amp;     jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_git &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install jupyter-matplotlib &amp;&amp;     if [ "$WORKSPACE_FLAVOR" = "light" ]; then         jupyter lab clean &amp;&amp;         jlpm cache clean &amp;&amp;         rm -rf $CONDA_DIR/share/jupyter/lab/staging &amp;&amp;         clean-layer.sh &amp;&amp;         exit 0 ;     fi &amp;&amp;     pip install --pre jupyter-lsp &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @krassowski/jupyterlab-lsp &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-chart-editor &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @lckr/jupyterlab_variableinspector &amp;&amp;     jupyter labextension install @ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter &amp;&amp;     pip install jupyterlab_code_formatter &amp;&amp;     jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_code_formatter &amp;&amp;     jupyter lab build &amp;&amp;     jupyter lab clean &amp;&amp;     jlpm cache clean &amp;&amp;     rm -rf $CONDA_DIR/share/jupyter/lab/staging &amp;&amp;     clean-layer.sh

 Just run the build myself with  and . However, I do not get this error as you can see here:

There might have been a temporary problem with the internet connection, too less disk space, or too less memory to complete the jupyterlab build. Just try it again and check if your disk space and memory is enough. Also check if the docker daemon has access to enough disk space and memory. It might be that your docker daemon is at the disk space limit and you might need to cleanup docker artifacts (e.g via &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/&gt;docker system prune&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Also, I have never build it on a Windows system (only Linux and Mac), so there might be certain issues with building it on Windows which I'm unaware of.

		I just rerun the build, and this time I got the same RuntimeError, but a few steps later. I will investigate this a bit further.

Me too. I prune the system and verified that there is enough space.
I also noticed that if I comment out the jupyter labextension install commands, the build completes just fine.
Thanks

		I found out that the plotly chart editor extension currently causes trouble and removed it (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/commit/94a503894c7427693f93c50630bfa047a5b638ed&gt;commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). You can check out the develop branch and try it again. Without this extension everything works fine for me.

 I just pushed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/commit/dace51e08e2aaff635562982719ea30dbf599b93&gt;another commit to develop&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which adds stdout logging to all lab extension installs. So, if there is an error you should now get the error, logs within the docker build logs.

@xprizedevops I just pushed another commit to develop which adds stdout logging to all lab extension installs. So, if there is an error you should now get the error, logs within the docker build logs.

I just commented out the plotly chart extension installation but I still get errors.
I'm now trying the latest commit (dev) with stdout logging...

		I'm still having issues. This time is a different issue while building the image:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Generating locales (this might take a while)...
