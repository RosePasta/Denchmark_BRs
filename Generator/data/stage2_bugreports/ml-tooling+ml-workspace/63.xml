	<summary>404 pop up when the folder name contains notebooks</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug:
When the folder name contains notebooks, seems &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/blob/fa0c5390b2dfc9f7c343453d4e8333d0a0ec338b/resources/jupyter/extensions/tooling-extension/jupyter_tooling/tooling-shared-components.js#L9&gt;this line of code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will cause two unexpected popup, showing 404 as a result.
See image:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3326332/103081971-b512f580-459e-11eb-8d5f-47be3c91b55c.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Console says js tried to load tooling/tools and tooling/storage/check after the baseURL was reconginized as the current full url, which caused the bug.
Expected behaviour:
Works fine without the popup.
Steps to reproduce the issue:

Create a folder named notebooks
Create a notebook
Two popups shows errors

Technical details:

Workspace version :
Docker version :
Host Machine OS (Windows/Linux/Mac):
Command used to start the workspace :
Browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari):

Possible Fix:
A better way of the regex?

I discovered this and thought it was related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/issues/62&gt;#62&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 at first, and was somehow caused by the pydeck extension. Then later I found out that it was actually a different bug ;)

 Good catch, thanks! I already changed the regex a few days ago (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/commit/fa0c5390b2dfc9f7c343453d4e8333d0a0ec338b&gt;fa0c539&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) :) But I will need to test if this fixes the mentioned problem.
