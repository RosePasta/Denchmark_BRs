	<summary>We can't debug in vscode.</summary>
	<description>
when we use vscode(&lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080/tools/vscode/&gt;http://localhost:8080/tools/vscode/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), there is no reaction if we debug. But using vscode in VNC, it's ok.

 This seems like a VScode version issue. It works on the up to date version. I created a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dagshub/ml-workspace&gt;fork here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and updated the relevant tools if you want to use it. Not sure what language you're writing it, but debugging in Python now works.

		Thanks to the two of you for reporting this and offering a solution! After merging PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace/pull/46&gt;#46&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Python debugging works also now with this workspace (right now you have to build it locally to use it but we will push a new image version soon)
