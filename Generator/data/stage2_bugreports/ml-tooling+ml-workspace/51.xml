Describe the bug:
ML Workspace fails to start and serve up Jupyter Notebooks
Started ML WORKSPACE with the Following Docker Command:
$ docker run -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    --name "ml-workspace" \
    -v "/Users/&lt;myuserid&gt;/Documents/Notebooks:/workspace" \
    --env AUTHENTICATE_VIA_JUPYTER="mytoken" \
    --shm-size 512m \
    --restart always \
    mltooling/ml-workspace:latest
57fc561fa9eb1c38261e9c6a09a66a1a4c2ca9e686fbb1991996cb4befa1f8a6
$
It launched and reported the container id
Expected behaviour:
When I go to &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I expect to get to my Jupyter Notebooks.  Instead I get a waiting forever display and the logs as you see below.
Steps to reproduce the issue:
Run the docker command as described above. Open &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the browser.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ReggieCarey&gt;@ReggieCarey&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I am not sure whether this is still relevant, but I just used the command on my machine (macOS BigSur 11.0.1) and I am able to access the workspace under &lt;denchmark-link:http://localhost:8080&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with Safari (14.0.1). My Docker version is 2.5.0.1.
Could you try to execute  and execute the command again after removing the workspace?
Maybe just restarting the container might help. In rare cases it seems like not all process in the workspace are able to correctly start. If this does not work, try to increase the amount of CPU &amp; Memory you permit Docker to use (in the task bar &gt; click on Docker Icon &gt; Preferences... &gt; Resources).
