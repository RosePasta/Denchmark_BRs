		This looks like that there is a problem with permissions, which is preventing the supervisor process from starting those tool processes (jupyter, nginx...). This can happen if you have changed the root user to a different user (currently only the root user is supported, as explained in the FAQ section &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml-tooling/ml-workspace#faq&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Or maybe you have mounted a volume into the home directory or any directory other than /workspace. Do you have additional information on your setup, e.g., docker run command, cloud provider or local computer? Is there any other error within the logs that might be related to permissions?
