		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martineastwood&gt;@martineastwood&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for reporting this issue! I was also able to reproduce the error. It seems like a bug with Jupyterlab version . I will fix it in the next workspace version by updating Jupyterlab to .
As a quickfix, you can just update jupyterlab within the running workspace (using the Jupyter terminal):
conda install -y -c conda-forge jupyterlab=1.1.4

		I just uploaded a new Workspace version (0.8.5) to Dockerhub which contains a fix for the terminal problem with JupyterLab. While upgrading JupyterLab makes the terminal functional again, the actual problem was with some incompatible JupyterLab extensions. You can try it out via:
docker run -p 8080:8080 mltooling/ml-workspace:0.8.5
