	<summary>Depparse problem with MWT</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I believe there is a bug when applying depparse and having MWT.
When building the dependencies, specifically at 


stanza/stanza/models/common/doc.py


         Line 401
      in
      1c6a850






 assert(int(word.head) == int(head.id)) 




 the assert fails because the ID of the word's head does not match the ID of the head itself.
It seems to fail because the dependencies and their head indices are computed over the tokens and not over the words. MWT are not added to the words list, see: 


stanza/stanza/models/common/doc.py


         Line 286
      in
      1c6a850






 if m or n: # if this token is a multi-word token 





So the indices do not match when comparing them.
To Reproduce
Using a MWT within a phrase. In this example, du is a MWT (de, le).
import stanza
NLP = stanza.Pipeline(lang='fr', processors="tokenize,lemma,pos,depparse", use_gpu=False)
doc = NLP("Séance ordinaire du 15 juin 2016")
Current behavior
A failed assertion when matching the IDs of the words:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "&lt;ipython-input-1-28223aa33ec0&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    assert(int(word.head) == int(head.id))
AssertionError
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
Depparse to work by correctly matching the head id with the word's head id.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Linux Mint 19.3
Python version:  3.7.7 from Anaconda
Stanza version: 1.0.1

Possible Fix
If we work over the tokens instead of over the words, by changing this:
head = self.words[int(word.head) - 1]
assert(int(word.head) == int(head.id))
to this:
head = self.tokens[int(word.head) - 1]
assert(int(word.head) == int(head.id))
It seems to work on my side and pytest tests/test_depparse.py passes :) Still, I suspect this may be more complex.
I did a branch with this modification here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/psorianom/stanza/tree/depparse_head_id_bug&gt;https://github.com/psorianom/stanza/tree/depparse_head_id_bug&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for the hard work!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/psorianom&gt;@psorianom&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, you could just include the  processor into the pipeline.
import stanza
NLP = stanza.Pipeline(lang='fr', processors="tokenize,mwt,lemma,pos,depparse", use_gpu=False)
doc = NLP("Séance ordinaire du 15 juin 2016")

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yuhui-zh15&gt;@yuhui-zh15&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but what happens if we do wish to disable mwt?

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yuhui-zh15&gt;@yuhui-zh15&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I run into the same error. I wanted to disable the MWT in German language because the tokens don't match with those from spaCy. To use the spaCy tokenizer in stanza for German is not possible at the moment, so I thought I could disable the MWT, which leads me to have this error.
Would it be possible to use the fix &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/psorianom&gt;@psorianom&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 described or would it lead to problems further in the pipeline?
