		Thank you.  This is a known issue.  A fix should be available shortly.

		I believe this is fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza/pull/406&gt;#406&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and will be officially available in v1.1.0. Closing for now.

		Using stanza now but it doesn't support write_to_conll_file. Is there a way around that?

		Is there something specific you are referring to?  Does it have anything to do with torch 1.6?

 I think the issue you mentioned is not directly related to this PyTorch API change issue. If you want to dump the Stanza annotations into a CoNLL file, &lt;denchmark-link:https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/data_conversion.html&gt;this page of the Stanza website&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 shows how to do it.

		Are you saying there is a further fix needed as of stanza 1.1.1, or are you
saying the issue is now fixed?

		The fix was for last year release of stanfordnlp. I've to try out new version then I'll inform whether the error is solved or not.  Thank you

		stanfordnlp is now stanza.  You would be much better off updating instead
of trying to fix potential bugs in stanfordnlp
