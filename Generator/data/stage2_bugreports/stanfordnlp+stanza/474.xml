	<summary>IndexError Thrown When Empty String Passed</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Attempting to process an empty string raises and IndexError from within stanza.
To Reproduce

import stanza
nlp = stanza.Pipeline('en')
nlp("")
IndexError is raised.

Expected behavior
An error that is not IndexError is raised, such as ValueError, or the call returns null data, like None or an empty list. If ValueError is raised, a short description stating an empty or invalid string was passed is given so the issues can be traced back to the correct source.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows
Python version: Python 3.8.0 from python.org
Stanza version: 1.1.1

Additional context
While not a huge issue, I was confused for a bit before I realized it wasn't my code but stanza that was throwing the error.
