	<summary>Unable to find resources.json</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
My program is raising an exception when I import stanza and try to set a value to stanza.Pipeline('en'):
The full exception follows:
c:\python38\lib\site-packages\stanza\pipeline\core.py in init(self, lang, dir, package, processors, logging_level, verbose, use_gpu, **kwargs)
75         resources_filepath = os.path.join(dir, 'resources.json')
76         if not os.path.exists(resources_filepath):
---&gt; 77             raise Exception(f"Resources file not found at: {resources_filepath}. Try to download the model again.")
78         with open(resources_filepath) as infile:
79             resources = json.load(infile)
"Exception: Resources file not found at: {userPATH}\stanza_resources\resources.json. Try to download the model again."
I have uninstalled and reinstalled without any success.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

import stanza
stanza_nlp = stanza.Pipeline('en')
run program
see error

Expected behavior
The model should have started extracting entities from a list of sentences that I already have pre-processed. (I did this successfully on a different machine)
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows 10
Python version:Python 3.8
Stanza version: 1.0.0

Additional context
I have already run stanza successfully on a different machine following the same steps. I did not get this issue last time. I am still relatively new to python. Could be staring me in the face, but hopefully solving this will help the next newcomer.

		Please download the model first and then try to initialize the pipeline:
import stanza
stanza.download('en')
stanza_nlp = stanza.Pipeline('en')

		Thanks for submitting this issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/smartin1296&gt;@smartin1296&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ran into the same problem. Might be good to add the download line to the tutorial section in the documentation rather than just the 'Get Started' section.
