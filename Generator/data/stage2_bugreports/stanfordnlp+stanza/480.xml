	<summary>Error while installing</summary>
	<description>
On python 3.8 I keep getting this error when trying to install:
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch&gt;=1.3.0 (from stanza) (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch&gt;=1.3.0 (from stanza)
I have already gone through the FAQs and installed pytorch using anaconda and verified that it successfully installed.

		You should be able to separately install torch first:

 Could you try installing pytorch version 1.3.0 or later with the package manager you're using (e.g., Anaconda), before trying to install stanza? In short, this is because PyTorch didn't make a release for all platforms (operating systems, architecture, etc) when they released more recent versions, and not a Stanza-specific issue.
