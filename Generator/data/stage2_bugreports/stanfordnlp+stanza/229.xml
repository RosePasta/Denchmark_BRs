	<summary>Named-entity recognition on pre-tokenized text appears to have an off-by-one issue</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Using the tokenize_pretokenized=True parameter when initializing a Pipeline object, and proceeding to use processors='tokenize, ner' to extract named entities results in inconsistent output, even when the tokenizations are identical.
To Reproduce
The following code (using pre-tokenized input)
stanza.download('en')
nlp = stanza.Pipeline(lang='en', processors='tokenize, ner', tokenize_pretokenized=True)

sents = [['Hello', 'John', 'Smith', ',', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'nifty', 'sentence', '.'], ['Farrell', 'Smyth', 'is', 'my', 'landlord', '.']]
doc = nlp(sents)

print([token for sent in doc.sentences for token in sent.ents])
produces the following output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[{
  "text": "John Smith",
  "type": "PERSON",
  "start_char": 6,
  "end_char": 16
}, {
  "text": "arrell Smyth ",
  "type": "PERSON",
  "start_char": 47,
  "end_char": 60
}]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note the off-by-one in arrell Smyth 
While the following code
stanza.download('en')
nlp = stanza.Pipeline(lang='en', processors='tokenize, mwt, pos, lemma, depparse, ner')

sents = 'Hello John Smith, this is a nifty sentence. Farrell Smyth is my landlord.'
doc = nlp(sents)

print([token for sent in doc.sentences for token in sent.ents])
Produces:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[{
  "text": "John Smith",
  "type": "PERSON",
  "start_char": 6,
  "end_char": 16
}, {
  "text": "Farrell Smyth",
  "type": "PERSON",
  "start_char": 44,
  "end_char": 57
}]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
One would expect the same output for both instances.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: MacOS
Python version: Python 3.7.4
Stanza version: 1.0.0
