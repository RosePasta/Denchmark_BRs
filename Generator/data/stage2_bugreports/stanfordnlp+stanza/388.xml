	<summary>Stanza not detecting GPU</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Stanza won't find the GPU. It'll always start in CPU mode.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
Python version: Tried with 3.8 and 3.7 from Anaconda (3.8 I installed Stanza via pip, 3.7 via conda)
Stanza version: 1.0.1

Additional context
PyTorch, CuDNN, etc, do get installed with the GPU.
GTX 1070

		Are you able to run other PyTorch-based programs with your setup/environment? What does torch.cuda.is_available() say?

		I think you're right, it's a runtime driver issue. Thanks
