 this seems more like a pytorch issue (the import failed at ). Can you try installing pytorch (and then ) through anaconda (especially use the recommended  command to install pytorch)? We've seen some of these issues with pip installed pytorch distributions.

		Installing within an anaconda solved the issue. Not that I now understand what went wrong, but at least it is working. Thanks
