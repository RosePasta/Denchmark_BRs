	<summary>FileNotFoundError for Old French lemmatizer</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When calling the default Old French NLP models (stanfordnlp.Pipeline(lang="fro")), then following error arises:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/kyle.p.johnson/stanfordnlp_resources/fro_srcmf_models/fro_srcmf_lemmatizer.pt'
To Reproduce
See gist here for commands and full traceback: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/kylepjohnson/d40215b380be4b050b5cc1ceac09e369&gt;https://gist.github.com/kylepjohnson/d40215b380be4b050b5cc1ceac09e369&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Expected behavior
Expect the Pipeline object to become instantiated.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: MacOS Mojave 10.14.6
Python version: Python 3.7.5 from pyenv
StanfordNLP version: 0.2.0

Additional context
I've tried several other languages (Ancient Greek grc and Latin lat) and the Pipeline works fine.

		We don't seem to officially support fro, though I can see a models download file for it.  You should just set lemma_use_identity to True in your application.
