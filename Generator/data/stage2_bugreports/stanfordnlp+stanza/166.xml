	<summary>stanfordnlp.server.client.TimeoutException: Timeout when executing Semgrex query</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Timeout when executing Semgrex query happens on long strings. This happens with the stanfordnlp library, but  not the deprecated python-stanford-corenlp library.
To Reproduce
Starting server with:
java -Xms2048m -Xmx18024m -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 360000 -inputFormat 'text' -outputFormat 'json' -be_quiet false -serializer 'edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.ProtobufAnnotationSerializer' -tokenize.options 'ptb3Escaping=false,invertible=true' -tokenize.language 'en' -annotators "tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma, ner, parse, depparse, coref"
Code to reproduce:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import time

		Again, thank you for the very clear explanation.  It looks like semgrex
does not honor the timeout command line parameter.  I'm not entirely clear
why.  Hopefully we can get a reason for this, but if nothing else, you can
edit it yourself.

in StanfordCoreNLPServer.java
look for this line:
        int semgrexTimeOut = (lastPipeline.get() == null) ? 75 : 5;
I think that changing that will change this result.

		I checked in a change which should unify the timeout logic between the root
handler and the rest of the server.  It should be available in the next
release

&gt; stanfordnlp/python-stanford-corenlp#19
&gt; &lt;stanfordnlp/python-stanford-corenlp#19&gt; was a
&gt; similar issue for the old library, and it looks like there's a bit of it
&gt; left in client.py mentioned in the error message (line 526). In client.py
&gt; I tried changing line 520 to timeout=240000 and it still failed. Also in
&gt; client.py this is mentioned in line 497:
&gt;
&gt;         # HACK: For some stupid reason, CoreNLPServer will timeout if we
&gt;         # need to annotate something from scratch. So, we need to call
&gt;         # this to ensure that the _regex call doesn't timeout.
&gt;         self.annotate(text, properties=properties)
&gt;
&gt; *Environment:*
&gt;
&gt;    - OS: Windows 10
&gt;    - Python version: 3.7
&gt;    - stanford-corenlp==3.9.2
&gt;    - stanfordnlp==0.2.0

		Alright, thank you! :)
Any idea if there will be a release before the end of the year? I don't know enough about Java to get it to compile myself.

		Hopefully yes.

Loosely speaking the steps are:

install "ant"
unzip the jar with "sources" in the name
mkdir src
mv edu src
ant

that should work

now copy the updated StanfordCoreNLPServer.java to
src/edu/stanford/nlp/pipeline
ant

hopefully that works too

now get rid of the corenlp jar and put "classes" in your classpath instead

If all of that works, great!  If not, hopefully the next release will be in
the next few weeks.
