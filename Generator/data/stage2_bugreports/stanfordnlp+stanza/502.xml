<bug id='502' author='Laurendus' open_date='2020-10-29T03:57:10Z' closed_time='2020-10-29T15:54:11Z'>
	<summary>Files are not correctly closed</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
In stanza/resources/common.py in lines 74 and 342 files are opened but never closed which leads to Python throwing a ResourceWarning. This was displayed to me when testing my code with Unittest.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create Unit-Test
Download a Model with stanza.download()
Receive several ResourceWarnings about unclosed files

Expected behavior
Files were correctly closed and no ResourceWarnings were emitted.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: MacOS
Python version: Python 3.8.6 from Homebrew in virtualenv
Stanza version: 1.1.1

Additional context
I guess this is a no-brainer but I wanted to follow your Contributing Guidelines.
Using context managers for opening the files closes the files correctly and prevents ResourceWarnings for me.

		Thanks for reporting this!  I have a patch which should fix the problem.
I'll just run it through the unit tests as a sanity check
