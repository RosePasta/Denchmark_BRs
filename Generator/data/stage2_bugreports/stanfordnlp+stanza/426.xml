	<summary>Failed to download model - The connection to nlp.stanford.edu timed out</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I 'm trying to download a model using stanza.download("el"). It fails with the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Downloading https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanfordnlp/stanza-resources/master/resources_1.0.0.json: 120kB [00:00, 597kB/s]
2020-08-12 17:36:49 INFO: Downloading default packages for language: el (Greek)...
....
....
....
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='nlp.stanford.edu', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /software/stanza/1.0.0/el/default.zip (Caused by NewConnectionError('&lt;urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x12f8052e0&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 60] Operation timed out'))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

stanza.download("el")
Run your script and it will fail with the error above.

Alternatively you can try to load https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanza/1.0.0/en/default.zip
and the same will happen.
Expected behavior
I would expect the model to be downloaded successfully.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: MacOS
Python version: Python 3.8.5 from Anaconda
Stanza version: 1.0.1

Additional context
I'm in Cyprus trying to load this model and after I read that people in China had similar issues I used a VPN but the same problem persists.
Is it possible that the resources server is down? I should also mention that in the last few days I could download models just fine so I'm suspecting this is a temp issue with the server.
Thanks

		A piece of our network equipment failed.  It will hopefully be repaired or replaced soon.

		The server issue is fixed and things should be back to normal now.
