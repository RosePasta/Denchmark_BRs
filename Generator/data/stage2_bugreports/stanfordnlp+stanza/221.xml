	<summary>Message in readme seems unnecessary (and wrong??)</summary>
	<description>
The following line in the README seems to be unnecessary or deprecated. Using a Jupyter notebook, I didn't need to use force=True and it downloaded just fine with no prompt. In fact, when I did include the flag I got a message: unexpected argument 'force'.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# IMPORTANT: The above line prompts you before downloading, which doesn't work well in a Jupyter notebook.
# To avoid a prompt when using notebooks, instead use: &gt;&gt;&gt; stanza.download('en', force=True)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: MacOS
Python version: Python 3.8 from Anaconda
Stanza version: stanza-1.0.0-py3

		Thank you for bringing this to our attention, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alex-calderwood&gt;@alex-calderwood&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! That's indeed a mistake (it's intended for a previous version of the package). I've updated the README!
