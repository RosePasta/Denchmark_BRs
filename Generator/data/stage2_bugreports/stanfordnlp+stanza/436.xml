	<summary>Starting CoreNLP server via stanza in Python fails</summary>
	<description>
Using Stanza 1.1.1 and multiple Python 3.x versions and multiple IDEs on a Mac, when I try to start the Stanford CoreNLP server, it fails to start because the classpath in the java command has no quotes around it.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Running this Python code (from the Stanza tutorial) fails with an io error in the console.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from stanza.server import CoreNLPClient
text = "Chris Manning is a nice person. Chris wrote a simple sentence. He also gives oranges to people."
with CoreNLPClient(
        annotators=['tokenize','ssplit','pos','lemma','ner', 'parse', 'depparse','coref'],
        timeout=30000,
        memory='16G') as client:
    ann = client.annotate(text)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My expectation is that the CoreNLP server would successfully start.

OS: MacOS 10.15.6
Python version: 3.85 (experienced with 3.6.x as well)
Stanza version: 1.1.1
IDE: IDLE (experienced with Spyder on MacOS and Ubuntu 18.04 as well)

An easy workaround is just to start the CoreNLP server from the command line, but having it all integrated would be nice.

		Do you have spaces or some other unusual character in the path to your
corenlp installation?

		No - no unusual characters...took the default path. Here's the console session that is generated. This is Python 3.8.5 in IDLE on MacOS, but I have see the same behavior on my Unbuntu 18.04 workstation as well.

		Try setting be_quiet=True

the classpath has nothing to do with this, btw
