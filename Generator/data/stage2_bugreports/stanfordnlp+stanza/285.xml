	<summary>Stanza CoreNLPClient is 20 time slower compared to stanfordnlp CoreNLPClient</summary>
	<description>
I have a CoreNLP server running with annotators pre-loaded.
Annotating the same sentence using Stanza's CoreNLPClient is about 20 times slower compared to using StanfordLib's CoreNLP client (version 0.1.1).   We currently use stanfordnlp.server.CoreNLP  (even though it is deprecated) because Stanza's client is too slow.
Here's code to reproduce test:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#pip install stanfordnlp==0.1.1
#pip install stanza

from stanfordnlp.server import CoreNLPClient     # Takes 2.6 seconds for 100 iterations
#from stanza.server import CoreNLPClient         # Takes 81.9 seconds for 100 iterations

import timeit


if __name__ == '__main__':

    text = """I have a problem with Caine FM-OTG (No hardware found) so I've followed the KB# 31312 (https://www.test.com/support/answers/31312.html)."""

    client = CoreNLPClient(start_server=False, endpoint='http://localhost:9050', annotators=['depparse', 'lemma'])
    print(timeit.timeit('client.annotate(text)', number=100, globals = globals()))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I can confirm this is happening.  I'll try to figure out why

		This is a bit unintuitive, but you can run it like this and get the desired
result:

  client = CoreNLPClient(start_server=False,
endpoint='http://localhost:9050', annotators=['depparse', 'lemma'])
  print(timeit.timeit('client.annotate(text,
annotators=["depparse","lemma"])', number=100, globals = globals()))

		Thanks for the workaround.
Verified that it works.

		Hopefully this can be fixed for the next version - I have a possible code change which will help
