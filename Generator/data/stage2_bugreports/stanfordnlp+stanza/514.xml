	<summary>Error with " Nulla" in Italian</summary>
	<description>
Steps to reproduce:

Create an it pipeline with processors tokenize,lemma,pos
Use " Nulla" as input

Without the space in the beginning it works
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;uWSGI exceptions catcher for "GET /?lang=it&amp;input=%20Nulla" (request plugin: "python", modifier1: 0)

Exception: builtins.AssertionError: Number of list elements must match with original indices.

Exception class: builtins.AssertionError

Exception message: Number of list elements must match with original indices.

Backtrace:
filename: "" line: -1 function: "" 
filename: "" line: -1 function: "" 
filename: "" line: -1 function: "" 
filename: "" line: -1 function: ""

filename: "" line: -1 function: ""

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It isn't a concurrency error as reported initially at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza/issues/510&gt;#510&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Are you saying there's no concurrency error after all?

Italian requires the 'mwt' annotator as well.  Unfortunately it is not
readily apparent which languages do or don't, although it's possible to get
that information from the .json file
pipeline = stanza.Pipeline("it", processors="tokenize,mwt,lemma,pos")

No, I've edited the issue with the concurrency error only and excluded others unrelated to concurrency

Thanks, I'll give it a try!
