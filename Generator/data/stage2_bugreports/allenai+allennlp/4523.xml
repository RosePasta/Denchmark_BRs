		We need more context than this in order to help you.
It looks like you've gotten allennlp installed in two places in your environment somehow, because you're running the @Subcommand.register("evaluate") twice.

		Closing, as I'm quite confident that this is an environment problem, but feel free to keep commenting if you still have issues.
