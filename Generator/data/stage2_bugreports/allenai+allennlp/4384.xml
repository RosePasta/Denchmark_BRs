Hi :)
last weak my code works on the colab. but now after I install allennlp I get an error on the following line.
from allennlp.commands.elmo import ElmoEmbedder
and the error is : ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'allennlp.commands.elmo'
I searched this repository for ElmoEmbedder but none found.

		We removed the elmo command in v1.0.  If you want to use the elmo command then you need to check out v0.9.0.  We removed this command because elmo is becoming a bit old and we didn't think it made sense to continue supporting it as a top-level command.
What are you trying to do specifically?  You might still be able to accomplish your goals in 1.0, but I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do.

		I am just playing with the code which I took from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ohyicong/glove_elmo/blob/master/main.py&gt;https://github.com/ohyicong/glove_elmo/blob/master/main.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and using the output of this code for another network that I have created.

		Hi,
How can I get the embed_sentence() functionality in v1.0 ?
Thanks!

		That functionality does not exist in 1.0, although you could copy the code that provided this into your code without too much work.  See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/v0.9.0/allennlp/commands/elmo.py#L213&gt;https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/v0.9.0/allennlp/commands/elmo.py#L213&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Great ! I'll give it a try.
My real goal is to get sentence embeddings in a bilm-tf environment, where I have incrementally trained an Elmo model.
