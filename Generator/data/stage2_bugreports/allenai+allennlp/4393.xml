	<summary>Unexpected behavior with DataLoader.batches_per_epoch</summary>
	<description>
From the discussion in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues/4362&gt;#4362&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If batches_per_epochs is less than the total number of batches in the dataset, there is no guarantee that all unique instances will be seen during training.

 It seems like  applies also to validation set. Is it expected behaviour?

		That is expected. If you only want batches_per_epoch set for training (like most use-cases, I assume) you can use a separate validation_data_loader.
