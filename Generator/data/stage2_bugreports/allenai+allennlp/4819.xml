&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In certain version of Python (verified with 3.7.8) attempting to import from the file token.py causes a circular import because there is an identically named file in the dependency tree of the dataclasses module.

Python traceback:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "token.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from dataclasses import dataclass
  File "/opt/anaconda3/envs/allentest/lib/python3.7/dataclasses.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    import inspect
  File "/opt/anaconda3/envs/allentest/lib/python3.7/inspect.py", line 40, in &lt;module&gt;
    import linecache
  File "/opt/anaconda3/envs/allentest/lib/python3.7/linecache.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    import tokenize
  File "/opt/anaconda3/envs/allentest/lib/python3.7/tokenize.py", line 35, in &lt;module&gt;
    from token import *
  File "/Users/tmcclintock/Github/allennlp/allennlp/data/tokenizers/token.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from dataclasses import dataclass
ImportError: cannot import name 'dataclass' from 'dataclasses' (/opt/anaconda3/envs/allentest/lib/python3.7/dataclasses.py)



&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Related issues or possible duplicates&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I was not able to find duplicate issue in the open or closed issues or in the current PRs.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

OS: OSX
Python version: 3.7.8

Output of pip freeze:

certifi==2020.11.8



&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Example source:

Begin by creating a fresh environment, cloning, and changing into the relevant directory:
conda create --name allentest python=3.7.8
conda activate allentest
git clone https://github.com/allenai/allennlp.git
cd allennlp/allennlp/data/tokenizers/
Attempt to run the file in question:
python token.py


&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Proposed solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The fix is easy, in that you can just rename the file so there is no collision mv token.py token_class.py and update import statements.

		Huh, that's interesting. The error still happens when you run
python allennlp/data/tokenizers/token.py
from the root of the repo, but doesn't happen when import from a Python interpreter:
python
&gt;&gt;&gt; from allennlp.data.tokenizers import token
&gt;&gt;&gt; # all good

		Yes, it's very subtle. The same error occurs in Python 3.9.0 (just checked).
I think it speaks to how "token" is overloaded. Collisions were inevitable I guess...

		Ok, yes, let's make that change. Would you like to make the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tmcclintock&gt;@tmcclintock&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
