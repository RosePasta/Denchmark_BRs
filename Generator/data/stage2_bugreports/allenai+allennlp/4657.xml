&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Installed the latest allennp in its own environment, I have the latest Python 3.7
I'm trying to run the sample example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; from allennlp.predictors.predictor import Predictor
import allennlp_models.tagging
predictor = Predictor.from_path("https://storage.googleapis.com/allennlp-public-models/ner-model-2020.02.10.tar.gz")
predictor.predict(
  sentence="Did Uriah honestly think he could beat The Legend of Zelda in under three hours?"
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but I either get an error that no module allennlp.predictos exists  or no module allennlp_models exists
Python traceback:


&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
