	<summary>Figure out non-determinism due to PYTHONHASHSEED</summary>

.  I'm not really sure what could be causing this, because I didn't think there was any randomness in  after  has been called.  But here are steps to reproduce:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ git checkout schmmd/weird-bug
$ set -x PYTHONHASHSEED 2157
$ allennlp/run serve

&gt; “spaceship”

1.  Navigate to http://localhost:8000.
2.  Click the MC Model tab.
3.  Submit the last example (The Millennium Falcon…)

$ git checkout schmmd/weird-bug
$ set -x PYTHONHASHSEED 4563123
$ allennlp/run serve

1.  Navigate to http://localhost:8000.
2.  Click the MC Model tab.
3.  Submit the last example (The Millennium Falcon…)

&gt; “variety of Star Wars expanded …”
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Rather than using the web-demo, it's much easier to reproduce using predict.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;allennlp/run predict 'https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/allennlp/models/bidaf-model-2017.08.26.tar.gz' input.json
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

My branch  is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/commit/6bd6e56f1edc855cb1d8428b35705910fb6aff8b&gt;SHA 6bd6e56f1edc855cb1d8428b35705910fb6aff8b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I just tried reproducing this, just to verify that it's been fixed.  I checked out that branch and didn't see this behavior.  I was using python 3.6, though, which fixes dictionary ordering, so maybe that's why?  I then tried creating a python 3.5 environment, and tried again, and I still couldn't get the predictions to switch just by changing PYTHONHASHSEED.  Not totally sure what's going on, but I'm going to call this fixed, because the dictionary ordering was almost certainly the cause of the issue.
