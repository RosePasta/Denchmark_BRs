	<summary>[Question] spans that have width equals 1</summary>
	<description>
Consider span that have width equals 2 (e.g. [0,1]) and combination formula (for EndpointSpanExtractor) 'y-x'. In this case the behavior is clear.
Now consider span that have width equals 1 (e.g. [1,1]). How will this case be handled? Will the formula 'y-x' be ignored?

		Hmm yeah that's a problem. I don't know what modeling you're trying to do, but you can try using the BidirectionalEndpointSpanExtractor which uses inclusive start indices and exclusive end indices (for the forward and reverse directions of a BiLSTM). I need to think a bit about how to fix this.
