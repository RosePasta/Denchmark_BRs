	<summary>Support for make-vocab in latest version</summary>
	<description>
I've noticed that in the latest allennlp version has been removed the useful command make-vocab. What's the reason for it? How can we reintroduce it without breaking the current code? I think it was extremely useful when it comes to processing a very big dataset avoiding running the vocabulary creation process all the time. On a related note, I was wondering whether the vocabulary creation was now using multiprocessing and whether was possible to configure the number of workers running in parallel.
Thanks,
Alessandro

		We removed that command because the functionality is duplicated by the --dry-run flag that you can pass to the train command.  Let us know if you run into any issues using that flag.
