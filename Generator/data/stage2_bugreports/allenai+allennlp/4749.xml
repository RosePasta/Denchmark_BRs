&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As per the page here &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.allennlp.org/v1.2.0rc1/#installing-using-docker&gt;http://docs.allennlp.org/v1.2.0rc1/#installing-using-docker&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Running the Docker image
You can run the image with docker run --rm -it allennlp/allennlp:latest. The --rm flag cleans up the image on exit and the -it flags make the session interactive so you can use the bash shell the Docker image starts.
however, when I run that command
docker run --gpus all  --rm -it -v $HOME/.allennlp:/root/.allennlp allennlp/allennlp:latest
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Status: Downloaded newer image for allennlp/allennlp:latest
usage: allennlp [-h] [--version]  ...

Run AllenNLP

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --version      show program's version number and exit

Commands:

    build-vocab  Build a vocabulary from an experiment config file.
    cached-path  Cache remote files to the AllenNLP cache.
    evaluate     Evaluate the specified model + dataset.
    find-lr      Find a learning rate range.
    predict      Use a trained model to make predictions.
    print-results
                 Print results from allennlp serialization directories to the console.
    test-install
                 Test AllenNLP installation.
    train        Train a model.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I assume you want to run bash on the container. In order to do that, you need to specify bash as the --entrypoint, because otherwise it will use the default entrypoint which in this case is just the allennlp command. So the complete command would be:
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -v $HOME/.allennlp:/root/.allennlp --entrypoint bash allennlp/allennlp:latest
