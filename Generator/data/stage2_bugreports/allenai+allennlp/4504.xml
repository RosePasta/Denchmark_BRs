&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In PyCharm console in Windows and in the CI ( Ubuntu 18.04) the output is duplicated. The nice Tqdm bars is lost. The output is repeated like that:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;accuracy: 0.9193, accuracy3: 0.9219, precision-overall: 0.3077, recall-overall: 0.2727, f1-measure-overall: 0.2892, loss: 95.4325, reg_loss: 6.7843 ||:  33%|###3      | 1/3 [00:02&lt;00:04,  2.14s/it]

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Pull by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/epwalsh&gt;@epwalsh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  checks for sys.stderr.isatty() and in my Pycharm console and in my Gitlab C.I the output is duplicated. Probably because the console is redirected internal. A option to keep the previous behavior would be great

		Ugh, in hindsight, maybe getting rid of the --file-friendly-logging flag was a bad idea. But I guess the main issue is that sys.stderr.isatty() is too crude / not really what we want to check.
Maybe there's a better way to check when we should automatically switch to FFL? Otherwise I'd vote for re-instating the FFL flag.

 the double output is just the last progress bar, i.e. when it gets to 100%. I've noticed this elsewhere. I think I have a fix for that.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/epwalsh&gt;@epwalsh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Yeah, I think a flag would be the best solution. Because  is too fragile. Many console emulators report it wrongly.
