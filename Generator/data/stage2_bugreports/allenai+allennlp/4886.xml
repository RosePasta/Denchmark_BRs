	<summary>[Model] The RC model training just hung there</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I have verified that the issue exists against the master branch of AllenNLP.
 I have read the relevant section in the contribution guide on reporting bugs.
 I have checked the issues list for similar or identical bug reports.
 I have checked the pull requests list for existing proposed fixes.
 I have checked the CHANGELOG and the commit log to find out if the bug was already fixed in the master branch.
 I have included in the "Description" section below a traceback from any exceptions related to this bug.
 I have included in the "Related issues or possible duplicates" section beloew all related issues and possible duplicate issues (If there are none, check this box anyway).
 I have included in the "Environment" section below the name of the operating system and Python version that I was using when I discovered this bug.
 I have included in the "Environment" section below the output of pip freeze.
 I have included in the "Steps to reproduce" section below a minimally reproducible example.

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/master/allennlp_models/rc&gt;https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/master/allennlp_models/rc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 here, and I met problems when using "distributed mode". When an epoch training "seemly" ended, and the next epoch is just going to start, the process just hung there, nothing happened for a loooong time until you killed it manually. It is really hard to find what's the problem there.
But when you killed it, and recovered it, it just worked well, until the end of epoch, again.

Python traceback:




&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Related issues or possible duplicates&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Which exact model / metric are you using? Can you share your training config?

		I'm guessing this is the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues/4794&gt;#4794&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If so, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues/4806&gt;#4806&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should address this.

 sorry for not replying soon. I used transformer_qa there, and the default metrics like f1, em. I ended up bypassing the problem using something like drop_last.
BTW, there are a few extra critical bugs in the rc module, I hope I have some time to pull a pr later this week.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gladuo&gt;@gladuo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. One more question: did it hang during the training loop or the validation loop?

Thanks @gladuo. One more question: did it hang during the training loop or the validation loop?


&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/epwalsh&gt;@epwalsh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Hey there, I rerun the training process without drop_last, and it is stable recurrence. It just appears by the end of validation process.

allenai/allennlp-models#191 pr is here

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/epwalsh&gt;@epwalsh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This pr is only for some other critical bugs, I have not fixed the dead lock above. Using drop_last in the data_loader could bypass the problem, that may be a start to debug it.

		The WARNING above in the picture may also help.
