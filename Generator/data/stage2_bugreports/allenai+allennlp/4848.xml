	<summary>Multi-process data loading occasionally hangs when worker does tensor ops on CPU</summary>
	<description>
When using num_workers &gt; 0 and start_method = "fork" with the multi-process data loader, there is the potential for dead locks if the dataset reader does any tensor computations on CPU.
The solution is to set the  to "spawn" or set the environment variable  to 1. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-cpu-hangs-on-nn-linear/17748/4&gt;https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-cpu-hangs-on-nn-linear/17748/4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
