	<summary>Dependabot is running on forks</summary>
	<description>
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/matt-gardner/allennlp/pull/4&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for a PR that was created by dependabot on my fork.  My guess is that this is because of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/.github/dependabot.yml&gt;this file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but it wasn't obvious to me how to disable this on forks (nothing in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates&gt;documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that I could easily find, either).

		See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2198&gt;this thread&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for some info, specifically &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2198#issuecomment-649444075&gt;this comment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Sounds like the only solution at the moment is to re-fork AllenNLP.

		The settings here won't work? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/settings/security_analysis&gt;https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/settings/security_analysis&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

, those are for vulnerabilities, and they are not enabled on my fork.
