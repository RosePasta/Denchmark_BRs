	<summary>mean_function.Linear problem with params</summary>
	<description>
I've noticed that the Linear mean function has a bug that causes unintended parameter sharing. E.g.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;m1 = GPflow.mean_functions.Linear()
m2 = GPflow.mean_functions.Linear()

print m1.b # 0
print m2.b # 0

m1.b = 1.

print m1.b # 1
print m2.b # has become 1. surely should be 0...

k1 = GPflow.kernels.RBF(1)
k2 = GPflow.kernels.RBF(1)

print k1.variance # 1
print k2.variance # 1

k1.variance = 2.

print k1.variance # 2
print k2.variance # still 1, as expected
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is due to the fact that b=np.array(1.) is given as a default argument, which is passed by reference to Param. Easy to fix  with a .copy(), but though I'd point this out in case it crops up elsewhere

		Thanks for the excellent report, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hughsalimbeni&gt;@hughsalimbeni&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I tried to fix this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/pull/278&gt;#278&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Could you take a look at that PR and tell me if the solution makes sense to you?
Thanks,
James.

		Related to the above issue: I was wondering about the list default arg for list_of_params in the constructor of ParamList, ie line 923 of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/blob/master/GPflow/param.py&gt;param.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
    def __init__(self, list_of_params=[]):
        Parameterized.__init__(self)
        for item in list_of_params:
            assert isinstance(item, (Param, Parameterized))
            item._parent = self
        self._list = list_of_params
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is this intentional here, ie do you mean to use a reference to same list each time you do not pass in an argument?

		Nope, this is a similar bug. Should only catch people using multiple paramlists and using the default argument though!
Perhaps the most elegant solution is to make the list_of_params argument non-optional. Then users can always init with [] if needed. Will break back compatibility, but I doubt it will actually hit any users.
