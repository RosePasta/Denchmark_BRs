	<summary>tests fail with tensorflow 10.0rc0</summary>
	<description>
One test fails with the new tensorflow pre-release, it's related to the custom-op test:
ImportError: No module named 'tensorflow.python.kernel_tests'
In addition, there sees to be an issue with one of the notebooks ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/161&gt;#161&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ), I'm looking into this.
