The v1.15 documentation link seems to be broken :(. It leads me to this page
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.1-docs/&gt;https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.1-docs/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which does not exist.

		Thanks for letting us know. By the way, we highly recommend using GPflow 2 rather than GPflow 1 if you can

		Where did you find the broken link?

		It's on the GPflow main page in section &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow#install-the-last-gpflow-version-compatible-with-tensorflow-1&gt;Install the last GPflow version compatible with TensorFlow 1:&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I'm trying to use someone else's code and they use an older version of GPFlow (version 0.4.0!!!!) and am just trying to understand a couple things. Any chance you have a link to documentation for that version?

		re 0.4.0, your best bet would be to checkout that version in the repository and look at/build the docs yourself from there. It's unlikely we have that version hosted anywhere

 thanks again for reporting this! The v1.5.1-docs had disappeared when we improved our workflow and started using a separate repository to host the compiled notebooks. I've just fixed that, so &lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.1-docs/&gt;https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.1-docs/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is working again 
Re 0.4.0, as Joel already pointed out, best to see if you can build the docs from that version in the git history.
