	<summary>Bug: Predictions with full_cov=True</summary>
	<description>
The functions model.predict_y() and model.predict_density() do not work nicely with full_cov=True. For example, take GPR, where the Gaussian likelihood is used. In predict_y() the likelihood function predict_mean_and_var() is called. Here a scalar value of the likelihood variance is added to the covariance matrix. For full_cov=True, this should be added only to the diagonal.
I'm not sure what the right resolution for this is. In the short term, maybe throwing an error for full_cov=True would be helpful to show that this is unsupported.
