	<summary>mean functions are initialized in arguments</summary>
	<description>
If we have two GPR instances, they share the same mean_function object. This is a problem, because recompilation of one triggers recompilation of the other!
A solution is to make the default argument None, and then instantiate the mean function in the init.
This may apply to other models as well as GPR.
