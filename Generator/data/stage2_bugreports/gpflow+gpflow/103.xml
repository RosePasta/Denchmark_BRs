	<summary>Non-determinism of codeship build failures</summary>
	<description>
I have had two cases in the last two weeks where are Codeship build has failed and then I have re-run it and it has worked fine.
In one case the error message was a server error which looked to have nothing to do with our code.
In the second case a command that is normally fine timed out suggesting that Codeship hung.
I would be willing to put up with this happening occasionally but I suggest that if others encounter similar problems we log it here and decide whether we think this acceptable given that there are other providers of build services on GitHub. In making such a decision we should also consider whether we have resolved &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/101&gt;#101&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
