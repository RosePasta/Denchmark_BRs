	<summary>`assign()` for new parameters</summary>
	<description>
I just saw &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/st--&gt;@st--&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's stackoverflow post, where it was written "In the MWE you assign a new value to a Parameter that is already existing (and does not have the logistic transform)". I was doing exactly this the other day, since in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/blob/b0e09ee6d669b2761cb14778507a903c38a9e0ff/doc/source/notebooks/understanding/models.ipynb&gt;models.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 cell 10 (below), it recommends to assign a  object using .
Is this an error in the documentation? It did not work for me, so I changed it to =, but I didn't follow up on it any further.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;old_parameter = m.kernel.kernels[0].lengthscale
new_parameter = gpflow.Parameter(old_parameter.value(),
                                 trainable=old_parameter.trainable,
                                 prior=old_parameter.prior,
                                 name=old_parameter.name.split(':')[0],  # tensorflow is weird and adds ':0' to the name
                                 transform=tfp.bijectors.Exp())
m.kernel.kernels[0].lengthscale.assign(new_parameter)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hello, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/markvdw&gt;@markvdw&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this is not a bug. The  was never supposed to work with Parameter, it is a part of the Tensor interface. You are doing everything right with replacing a parameter using an equal sign. Just to clarify:  sign is a setter for the module's attributes and  is a part of  interface to be able to change the value of the variable/parameter.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/st--&gt;@st--&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I'm removing the bug tag, although we need to clarify that in the documentation.

		It's a bug in the documentation, which is currently misleading and should be improved.
