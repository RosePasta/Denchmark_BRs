	<summary>`master` documentation is not building automatically</summary>
	<description>
While the documentation for the  branch is now building freshly on each merged pull request, the  documentation is out of date. This was evidenced by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/1403&gt;#1403&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which pointed out that the &lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/master/notebooks/advanced/multiclass_classification.html&gt;multiclass classification notebook (master)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 had a bug, whereas everything was working fine as expected in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/develop/notebooks/advanced/multiclass_classification.html&gt;develop version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		Thanks to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vdutor&gt;@vdutor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for manually kick-starting the documentation build for  as a one-off - this brings the documentation up to date with the 2.0 release from yesterday. We should automate this in the long run, but has lower priority for now.
