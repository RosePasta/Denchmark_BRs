	<summary>Config does not handle environment variables correctly</summary>
	<description>
In gpflow2, gpflow/config/__config__.py has code for overwriting the default values for float/int dtype, jitter, etc using environment variables (instead of a gpflowrc file as in previous versions). However, this is currently broken as it does not actually convert the strings returned by os.getenv() into the required types (e.g. "float32" -&gt; np.float32 or "0.0001" -&gt; 1e-4).
