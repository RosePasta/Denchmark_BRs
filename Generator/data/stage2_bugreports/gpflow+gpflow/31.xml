		Some data as of today running all the tests simply be calling python on each one (i.e not using nose or setup.py or coverage) in turns takes the following amount of time:
real    10m40.465s
user    10m42.892s
sys 0m45.133s

		Some more data: running all the tests using python setup.py test (no nose no coverage) takes more than  41 minutes! It should be roughly the same as what I did above. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jameshensman&gt;@jameshensman&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this seems like it could be relevant to our current predicament.

		Running tests with coverage and through python without setup tools takes 114m on my desktop.

		It seems a lot of the slowness was coming from very slow unnecessary compile steps. I have removed these and the travis-ci is currently running.
