<bug id='298' author='jameshensman' open_date='2016-12-15T11:09:54Z' closed_time='2017-01-14T13:54:54Z'>
	<summary>Documentation is not autogenerating</summary>
	<description>
Readthedocs is not working because it doesn't natively support python 3.5. This is causing updates to our documentation (e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/pull/296&gt;#296&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) to not-appear on gpflow.rtfd.io.
I'm not completely clear on what the bug is, but happy to add people to the readthedocs account if you want to help.
