	<summary>docs should include reference to GPLVM methods</summary>
	<description>
Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alexisboukouvalas&gt;@alexisboukouvalas&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
You noted that the docs don't include a reference to the GPLVM yet, even though there is a notebook.
The way to add the notebook to the docs is to modify doc/source/index.rst. It will be obvious how to add the notebook when you open the file :)
You could also modify doc/source/intro.rst, thich contains some description of the project, and what's included. Suggest you update this also.
To build the docs, install the dependencies
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install sphinx nbsphinx numpydoc
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then from the doc directory, type make html and the open doc/build/index.html
Once the edits are pushed to master, they will appear automatically within a few minutes on readthedocs.org. If you'd like access to GPflow on readthedocs.org, which will let you automatically build docs on branches, make an account there and I will give you access.
James.

		I think this is a bug as intro.rst points to the GPLVM notebook.
