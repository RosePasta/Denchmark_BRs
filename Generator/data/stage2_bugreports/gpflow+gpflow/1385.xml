	<summary>Monitor doesn't update when using multiple tasks</summary>
	<description>
If I have multiple tasks in the monitor (e.g. ModelToTensorBoard and ScalarToTensorBoard), then one of them will stop to update in TensorBoard, even though the data is still being written to the file.
I believe the problem is that each task uses its own FileWriter, which gives each task a different events file. TensorBoard gives the error
E0329 00:03:23.523564 123145515630592 directory_watcher.py:244] File ./adam_SqExp_Points_M1000/events.out.tfevents.1585439824.mv310.53594.189.v2 updated even though the current file is ./adam_SqExp_Points_M1000/events.out.tfevents.1585439824.mv310.53594.205.v2
Could this make sense? Any suggestions on how to fix it?

		A workaround is to use , as suggested in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/1063&gt;tensorflow/tensorboard#1063&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
