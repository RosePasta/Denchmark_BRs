		I changed those in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/pull/342&gt;#342&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so it should be enough to remake the docs I guess.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrksr&gt;@mrksr&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I tried to rebuild and found that readthedocs gives an error on tensorflow 1.00
tensorflow-1.0.0-cp34-cp34m-linux_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
I will look into it.

		This looks to be an easy fix, we've simply ended up with py 3.4 in docs_require rather than py 3.5 I will do a PR.
