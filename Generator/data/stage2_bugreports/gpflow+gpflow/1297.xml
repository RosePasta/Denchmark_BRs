	<summary>Readthedocs is still serving stale versions (e.g. "stable")</summary>
	<description>
These are still indexed by Google, so simply searching for the docs leads people to out-of-date docs that are broken - not a good image for us! Especially as the current docs are actually working so much better...

		In general I think the documentation is very confusing. Isn't there some way you could include the actual version the doc is for, instead of the master/develop thing. In addition there are quite a few dead docs that are still referenced.
I feel as if I get a different version of the docs each time

 please check it now that I've updated the versions, if you find any further issues with the docs please open an issue again!
This has now been resolved by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/docs/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml&gt;the CircleCI run in the master branch of the docs repo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 calling a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/docs/blob/master/tag-stable.sh&gt;shell script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that tags the master branch at that commit with the format readthedocs expects for building its "stable" documentation.
This would also allow us to enable old versions of the docs!
