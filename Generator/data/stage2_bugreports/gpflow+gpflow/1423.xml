	<summary>Matplotlib import problem with simple coregionalization notebook</summary>
	<description>
In the notebook &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/blob/develop/doc/source/notebooks/advanced/coregionalisation.pct.py&gt;"A simple demonstration of coregionalization"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, Matplotlib is imported in a way that  like it should work, but doesn't:
import matplotlib
plt = matplotlib.pyplot
In version 3.1.3 of Matplotlib, that second line, plt = matplotlib.pyplot, leads to an error with the message "AttributeError: module 'matplotlib' has no attribute 'pyplot'."
However, changing the import statement to the following (and of course, getting rid of the assignment to plt) does work:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
However, for the notebook in question, matplotlib.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (12, 6) has to be changed to plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (12, 6).
After the notebook is tweaked with the changes described above, it runs just fine.

		Thanks for bringing this to our attention! Sounds like you found not just the bug, but already the solution - so I'd encourage you to simply make these changes in your own fork of GPflow, and then to open a pull request into the GPflow develop branch - it's quite simple (easier than writing up an issue report, I find...), happy to help you out if you want:)
