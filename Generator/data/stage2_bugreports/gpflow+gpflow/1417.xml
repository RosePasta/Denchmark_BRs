	<summary>Some documentation still treats kernels as if they have an input_dim parameter</summary>
	<description>
In the notebook &lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/develop/notebooks/advanced/multioutput.html&gt;"Multi-output Gaussian processes in GPflow"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there are Python statements like the following, where the initializers of kernels each have an integer argument:
kernel = gpf.kernels.SharedIndependent(gpf.kernels.RBF(1) + gpf.kernels.Linear(1), output_dim=P)
kern_list = [gpf.kernels.RBF(D) + gpf.kernels.Linear(1) for _ in range(P)]
kern_list = [gpf.kernels.RBF(D) + gpf.kernels.Linear(D) for _ in range(L)]
Judging from the definition of , it looks like those integer arguments are meant to be the  arguments for the kernel initializers, but those arguments &lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/develop/notebooks/gpflow2_upgrade_guide.html#Kernel-Input-Dims&gt;no longer exist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I don't know if this problem occurs in other notebooks, but it wouldn't surprise me.

		Oufffff. Good catch! It was a huge effort porting all the notebooks across, and I wish we hadn't missed this one - but thanks for spotting it now! Would you like to help us out &amp; contribute by fixing the notebook &amp; opening a pull request ? Happy to help you out with the details if you like. We also have a Slack workspace at &lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.slack.com&gt;https://gpflow.slack.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if you'd want to join the chat! (Invite link in the README.md)

		I can't promise that I'll have the time to do that, unfortunately.

That's okay - if you don't manage to do it hopefully someone else will get to it at some point!

		This will be fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/pull/1430&gt;#1430&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. There was one other occurrence.
