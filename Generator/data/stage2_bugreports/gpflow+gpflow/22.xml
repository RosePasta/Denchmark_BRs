	<description>
I get am import error when trying to import GPflow:
"ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import"
I have followed the pip installation advice (on a Ubuntu machine with Python 2.7.6) and downgraded numpy to version 1.9.3.

		Hi Pablo,
Thanks for your interest in GPflow .
What happens if you leave GPflow out of the loop and just try to import numpy?
Could you include the full error message please?
Thanks,
Alex

		Thanks for the quick response Alex!
Here is the full log (after import GPflow):

ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import
the normal numpy import works fine!

		Hmm OK this is odd I haven't seen this problem,
Do you get the same problem if you install the standard tensorflow? (This won't work with GPflow)
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install --upgrade &lt;denchmark-link:https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

python
import tensorflow as tf
You will need to reinstall our version of tensorflow after doing this.

		Thanks Alex! Tensorflow doesn't have any problems, I can import it after following the steps above.

		Sorry I will try that again (I just deleted a  post contained error).
I'm afraid I'm off for the long weekend now. It looks like some clash with your specific packages that is going to be difficult to track remotely. It might be an idea to have a look at the Travis file in the route of the source to see how we install it for test in the meantime.

		I've now build from source and get a different error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import GPflow
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "GPflow/__init__.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from . import likelihoods, kernels, param, model, gpmc, sgpmc, priors, gpr, svgp, vgp
  File "GPflow/model.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    from scipy.optimize import minimize, OptimizeResult
ImportError: cannot import name OptimizeResult
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I've update to the most recent scipy version (scipy==0.17.0) and  import minimize works - it is the OptimizeResult that fails. OptimizeResults shows up on the docs for 0.17. but I cannot import it. Any ideas? Which scipy version are you running on?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PabloLeon&gt;@PabloLeon&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I'm using
python 2.7.11
Anaconda 2.1.0 (x86_54)
scipy 0.17
numpy 1.10.4
osx
for what it's worth, the following works fine for me:
from scipy.optimize import OptimizeResult
Are you using python 3, perhaps? Please list your environment, and we'll try to help.

		Did you ever follow this up &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PabloLeon&gt;@PabloLeon&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Sorry wasn't around a while... I have both python2/3 on my work machine. I installed (and used) python for everything related to GPflow though (and all dependencies etc. are installed for python 2). I will have a look at it on Monday and update this.

		I needed to reset my machine and opted to go for the Anaconda setup. Everything seems to work fine now. Thanks for the help!
