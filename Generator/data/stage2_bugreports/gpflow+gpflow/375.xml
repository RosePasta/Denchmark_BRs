	<summary>Error testing GPFlow</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm having trouble running the tests (and importing) on my mac, but installations seems fine. The issue seems similar to other reported issues (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/173&gt;#173&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/227&gt;#227&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) but I haven't heard of having this happen on a mac.

		Did you build your own pip package or did you use the one on pypi?
There's an issue where the google-build uses (used?)  gcc4, and if your system is using gcc5 there's a missing symbol somewhere. To work around this, we add an extra flag in setup.py if the local version of gcc is 5.
Problem is, if tensorflow was built with gcc 5 (as in, on your own machine) then adding this flag causes the symbols not found error like you describe.

		I tried both the master branch and tag 0.3.4 from GitHub and installed with python setup.py develop.
If its this line as mentioned in the other issues:
if gcc_version &gt; 4:
compile_command += " -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0"
Its not run by default because I'm on a mac, but I did try adding that and gets me a seg fault

		Hmm, tricky.
I suspect that the best way to get this working is to build your own tensorflow whl file, and then compile GPflow against that.
could you let use know the output of gcc --version please

		<comment id='4' author='mfrate28' date='2017-03-10T16:59:22Z'>
		Sure, its:

		Could you simlink clang back in whilst compiling GPflow?

Works on my mabbook pro, late 2013, Sierra, using

gcc --version
&lt;snip&gt;
Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.38)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.1.0

		Sorry for bumping up and old thread but can i ask how this issue was fixed? Im on a MacBook Pro at the moment and have trouble testing GPflow. Since I am a bit of an OS X newbie Im not sure how I should link gcc and clang, which seems to be the aforementioned solution. Any help would be appreciated!

 if you are using the most recent version of GPflow it shouldn't be necessary to compile anything. We removed the user ops that needed compiling in favour of a pure standard TensorFlow implementation of the relevant part. Let us know if you keep having problems.

		Ok so the warnings you posted  look like the are coming from MANIFEST.in .I've filed a bug for that: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/issues/474&gt;#474&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 My apologies.
I'm not currently sure if the error you are getting is directly related to the warnings. What happens if you delete the lines
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;include GPflow/tfops/*.so
include GPflow/tfops/*.cc
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/blob/master/MANIFEST.in&gt;MANIFEST.in&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 then reinstall?

		I suspect this is not a blocker to using GPflow but an error with the tests themselves. I would like to get it sorted but in the meantime I don't think it should stop you trying the software.
Have you tried using the notebooks ?&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/tree/master/doc/source/notebooks&gt;https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/tree/master/doc/source/notebooks&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This is most likely that the test dependencies have not be installed.
I first had the same error until I realised I was running my (empty) python 2 environment. Using my gpflowopt env everything works perfectly. Does running the notebooks require some extensions (at least jupyter/nbconvert needs to be there I assume, etc.)?
We have the test deps in setup.py:
'test': ['nose', 'coverage', 'six', 'parameterized']}
Most likely similar to GPflow (except paramterized you don't need), and I see we are missing jupyter (we have that in the doc deps) which you need also.

 I tried using the tutorials on:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/regression.html&gt;http://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/regression.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but some of the functions like
m.mean_function.A.prior = GPflow.priors.Gaussian(0., 10.) m.mean_function.b.prior = GPflow.priors.Gaussian(0., 10.)
dont work.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/icouckuy&gt;@icouckuy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 So how would make the gpflowopt env as my active environment?

		<comment id='19' author='mfrate28' date='2017-08-10T18:44:08Z'>
		With gpflowopt env I meant the virtualenv that I installed locally for running GPflowOpt. I see you are using anaconda on mac, so just make sure you have installed all the latest dependencies using pip, including jupyter.
pip install -U -e .
pip install -U jupyter nbconvert
Normally an anaconda env includes jupyter so I'm not sure which dependencies you are missing for running the notebook tests.
What error do you get with the above tutorial (please always provide a full error/stacktrace so we  can  help you better)?

		So i installed the jupyter dependency using pip, but I still get the note book error
here is what I get when I run the regression tutorial in my file GP.py:
Traceback (most recent call last): File "GP.py", line 22, in &lt;module&gt; m.mean_function.A.prior = GPflow.priors.Gaussian(0., 10.)

Not to mention none of the plotting functions work, even with a virtual environment, Im using matplotlib.use('TkAgg') in the top of the file, there is no error when i call plt.plot() but no window pops up
