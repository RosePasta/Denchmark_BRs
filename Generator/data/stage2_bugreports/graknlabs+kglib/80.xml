	<summary>A Clerical Error in the README.md</summary>
	<description>
Maybe there is a clerical error that exists in the sentence :"Delete all appendix attributes from both animaltrade_train and animaltrade_test keyspaces. This is the label we will predict in this example, so it should not be present in Grakn otherwise the network can cheat"
Here the animaltrade_train may should be animaltrade_eval.  Just let me know if that's right.

		Hi, so in fact the script has been written to be generic, and accept an evaluation keyspace, but in this case the data is only partitioned into animaltrade_train and animaltrade_test, so it is correct as it stands. We definitely want to remove the stored ground truth labels from the test set as well as the training set.
I'll close the issue for now
