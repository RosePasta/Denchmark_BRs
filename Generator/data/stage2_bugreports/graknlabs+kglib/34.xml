	<summary>Cannot install kglib - no matching distribution found for tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
I can't get to install grakn-kglib. After I run "pip3 install grakn-kglib" (inside a new venv), I receive this error:
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow==1.11.0 (from grakn-kglib) (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for tensorflow==1.11.0 (from grakn-kglib) 
I'm running python 3.7.1.

		It seems TensorFlow &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/17022&gt;doesn't work with Python  #3.7+&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 yet, so it isn't available via pip for that version. Try using a flavour of Python 3.6 instead, that should work. Thanks for raising this!
