	<summary>Conversion to R segfaults when tensor is still on GPU</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;t &lt;- torch_tensor(2, device = torch_device("cuda"))
as_array(t)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I know this is not supposed to work (need to move to cpu first) but it would probably be nice not to segfault :-)
