	<summary>Upload lantern builds to a public bucket</summary>
	<description>
The bucket we are uploading lantern builds should be public for downloads, so it can be used by users when first installing torch.
We could upload to github releases: see for instance: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action&gt;https://github.com/svenstaro/upload-release-action&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
