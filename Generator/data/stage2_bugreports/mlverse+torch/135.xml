	<summary>necessity of N symbol used in indexing</summary>
	<description>
going through the existing vignettes to see what I'm missing for the book (gonna send PR soon)...
I'm just wondering, do we need this?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x[5:N]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I mean, -1 does the same, right? Just thinking that the fewer things to remember, the better ...

		I think N has a small difference form -1. For instance:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x[2:N]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

is not equivalent to x[2:-1].
But perhaps we want to change that actually and then remove N

		oh, got it. Yes - judging from what I erroneously assumed myself...my thinking was, the -1 concept is from Python, but the behavior is R-like (including, not excluding, the index).
Yes I think I would favor that, then - change -1 behavior and remove N.
Note to self: also need to rephrase what I write in the book, then (re concept vs implementation)
