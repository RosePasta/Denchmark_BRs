	<description>
hello, we found that using train.py for single node training is much slower than using train_multi.py.
It seems that it takes a long time in running chainer.iterators.MultiprocessIterator in train.py. Did you see similar issue on your site?
Be notice, even we use train_multi.py, only one node was used.

		How did you investigate the duration of chainer.iterators.MultiprocessIterator? Perhaps, changing n_processes has some effect.
