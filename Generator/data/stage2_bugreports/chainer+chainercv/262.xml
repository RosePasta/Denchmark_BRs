	<summary>pickle error.. using chainercv with chainermn</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I am trying to use chainercv with chainermn.
I used chainercv with some of my new projects and when i attempt to distribute training using chainermn, I receive the following error from the  method. All i am doing is applying a  transform to the training data. I get the error for all my projects that use chainercv and have replicated it using the &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/MannyKayy/a383b35d70124d7069e78255ed67b452&gt;chainermn mnist example file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7952854/26975100-46ff5626-4d16-11e7-8ccc-6ab634541a66.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm not sure as to where to raise this issue so I have raised it in both the chainercv and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chainer/chainermn/issues/88&gt;chainermn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 repos.

		The error occurred because function objects can not be pickled.
We will look into a way to fix this issue. Thank you very much for reporting.

		Hi. Sorry for the late reply.
Since pickling is the issue, can you put the transform function outside of the main function?
A function can be picklable as long as it is not declared inside another function.
