	<summary>The output of Caffe and Tiny-dnn with the same model are quite different....</summary>
	<description>
I test the output probabilitys of a Caffe model and a tiny-dnn model which is transformed from Caffe. But I found the outputs are totally different...

		I  used the following code to convert Caffe model to tiny-dnn model. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Randl&gt;@Randl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

void convert(const string&amp; model_file,
          const string&amp; trained_file ) {

    // load model and weights
    auto net = create_net_from_caffe_prototxt(model_file);
    reload_weight_from_caffe_protobinary(trained_file, net.get());

    // save model, weights, architecture
    net-&gt;save("tiny-model");
    net-&gt;save("tiny-weights-json", content_type::weights, file_format::json);
    net-&gt;save("tiny-weights-binary", content_type::weights, file_format::binary);
    net-&gt;save("tiny-architecture", content_type::model, file_format::json);
}

		Can you provide full reproducible example so I could try to run it on my PC?

		@karandesai-96 you been playing with models right? could you also re-check this?

		Thanks. I have that the recent version is right for the converting example. I used 1.0.3a to have the dismataching problem.
