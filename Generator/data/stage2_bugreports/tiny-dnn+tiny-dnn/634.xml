	<summary>load_validation_data is redundant</summary>
	<description>
load_validation_data doesn't actually do anything.

and it seems like it's never done anything since it was created:

		Something went wrong from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn/pull/154&gt;#154&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. validation.size() is always 1, so outer for-loop is meaningless... I will fix it. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw&gt;@tomjaguarpaw&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thank you for your reporting :)
