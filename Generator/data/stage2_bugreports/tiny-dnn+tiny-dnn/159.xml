	<summary>mean-squared-error loss function little bug</summary>
	<description>
hi again,
I have found a little bug with mean-squared-error loss function. Turns out that the current result for this is the halved total squared error over all training patterns. In file loss_function.h line 36 :
return (y - t) * (y - t) / 2;
After in file network.h line 447 there is something like:
for_i(out.size(), [&amp;](int i){ e += E::f(out[i], t[i]); });
Which is actually wrong.
