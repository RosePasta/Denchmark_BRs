	<summary>MINGW build issue</summary>
	<description>
Walking around I have found another issue of tiny-dnn. This time when experimenting with different compilers I have tried to use MINGW 5.3.2 and found that when network::train(...) function called application crashes. Note that same application works well when is built by Microsoft  c++ compilers (2013 and 2015 versions x86 and x64).  Debuger says that memory segmentation fault occurred, operation system (MS Win7x64) throws window about crash and says that problem in module ntdll.dll
