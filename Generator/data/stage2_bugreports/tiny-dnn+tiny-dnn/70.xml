	<summary>Crash in dropout_layer.</summary>
	<description>
If you use the &lt;&lt; operator of network to construct your network the raw mask_ pointer member in dropout_layer causes a crash because the default copy ctor and assignment op don't deep copy mask_ (and a copy occurs in &lt;&lt;).
I have local changes that convert mask_ into a vector of uint_8 and it fixes the issue because std::vector implements copy construction and assignment operators and the default implementation that do memberwise =  then work for dropout_layer.
Unfortunately, we cannot just use vector&lt;bool&gt; because vector&lt;bool&gt; is a specialization that works differently than vectors normally work and operator [] is not an l-value...
So, I can check in my changes... OR if you prefer I could implement assignment operators and copy constructors for dropout_layer... that would also work.

		I changed my implementation to one that implements assignment and copy ctor... While this means adding 2 new functions to dropout_layer.h, it requires the least amount of changes to the forward_propagation() and back_propagation() methods.

Thanks for your information :) Implementing assignment and copy ctor will be nice, could you make a pull request for this problem?
