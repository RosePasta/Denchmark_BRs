	<summary>Should I explicitly call init_weight()?</summary>
	<description>
If I do not want to use built-in serialization method and prefer to use my own (for compatibility reasons), should I explicitly call init_weight() before upload weights into the network? I asked because on version 0.1.1 all works without this method call, but on modern 1.0.0 without this call my project crashes and debuger points to the "nodes.h" line297: nn_error("Layer " + l-&gt;layer_type() + " not initialized."); .

Hi,
It's not an intentional behavior. tiny-dnn should work without calling init_weight() explicitly. I'll check and fit it. Thanks for reporting!
