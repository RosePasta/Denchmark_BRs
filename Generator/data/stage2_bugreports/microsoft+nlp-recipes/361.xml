	<summary>[BUG] We should have a separate package yaml file for the utils_nlp package</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Right now all dependencies are generated by running "generate_conda_file.py" file to generate the .yaml file, but it would be better if we have separate dependency file for the utils_nlp package.
When we release utils_nlp as a pip installable package, users are expecting to have all dependencies listed somewhere. On my Windows machine (with GPU), even the pytorch-pretrained-bert and dask packages are listed in the nlp_gpu.yaml file, it's not installed properly. I need to manually install those packages to run the notebook "entailment_multinli_bert".
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
