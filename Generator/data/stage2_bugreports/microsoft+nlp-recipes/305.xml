	<summary>[BUG] RemoveError: 'requests' is a dependency of conda and cannot be removed from conda's operating environment.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Unable to create the conda environment, here is the error I got
RemoveError: 'requests' is a dependency of conda and cannot be removed from
conda's operating environment.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am following the steps on this page &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/nlp/blob/master/SETUP.md&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/nlp/blob/master/SETUP.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I already have a conda environment called nlp_cpu, hence I was trying to create a new environment called nlp_repo_cpu.
When I run this line: conda env create -f nlp_cpu.yaml
I run into this error:
RemoveError: 'requests' is a dependency of conda and cannot be removed from
conda's operating environment.
How do I go about fixing this issue?
