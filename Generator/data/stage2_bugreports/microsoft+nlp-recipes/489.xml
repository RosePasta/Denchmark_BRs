	<summary>[BUG] Need to add `scrapbook`, `nltk`, `seqeval`, and `transformers` packages as dependencies in setup file</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The package scrapbook, nltk, seqeval, and transformers are missing if follow the setup file. We will need to add this package as dependency. The new environment is created on a GPU machine.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Other Comments&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
