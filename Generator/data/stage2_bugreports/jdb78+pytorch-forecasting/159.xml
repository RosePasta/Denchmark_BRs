PyTorch-Forecasting version: 0.6.0
PyTorch version: 1.6
Python version: 3.8
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04

I updated PyTorch-Forecasting from 0.5.2. to 0.6.0.
Seems like a part of your code in timeseries.py around [804:812] has a mistake.
Here how it looks:
warnings.warn(
(
"Min encoder length and/or min_prediction_idx and/or min prediction length is too large for "
f"{len(missing_groups)} series/groups which therefore are not present in the dataset index. "
"This means no predictions can be made for those series",
f"First 10 removed groups: {list(missing_groups.iloc[:10].to_dict(orient='index').values())}",
),
UserWarning,
)
which results in Typeerror: expected string or bytes-like object
You have two redundant commas in the message part which crashes the code. Should look like:
warnings.warn(
(
"Min encoder length and/or min_prediction_idx and/or min prediction length is too large for "
f"{len(missing_groups)} series/groups which therefore are not present in the dataset index. "
"This means no predictions can be made for those series"&lt;NO_COMMA&gt;
f"First 10 removed groups: {list(missing_groups.iloc[:10].to_dict(orient='index').values())}"&lt;NO_COMMA&gt;
),
UserWarning,
)
am I right?
