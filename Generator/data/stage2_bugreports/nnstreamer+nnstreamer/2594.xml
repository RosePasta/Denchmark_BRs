	<summary>Tensor filter updates properties with empty string</summary>
	<description>
Tensor filter set property updates its properties with empty string.
Single API passes the properties given by the user directly to the tensor_filter_common (after stringify).
In case, for example, if the names aren't set, empty name is given to the property.
gst_tesnor_filter_set_property() does not update the internal properties with empty properties.
However, it does update the number of tensors (to 0 in the above example).
