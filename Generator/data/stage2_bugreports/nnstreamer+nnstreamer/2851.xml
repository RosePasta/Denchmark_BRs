	<summary>Unable to locate package nnstreamer-tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When I install nnstreamer and nnstreamer-example using PPA， the following error exist:
**sudo apt-get install nnstreamer-example
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
nnstreamer-example : Depends: nnstreamer-tensorflow but it is not installable
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.**
What is wrong with the nnstreamer-tensorflow source ?

 Please Take a Look at this (maybe Ubuntu PPA deployment issue?)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RockeyLuo&gt;@RockeyLuo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 : Please let us know more about your situation so that we can reproduce your issue. I.e., what's your distro version?

 Since &lt;denchmark-link:https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer-example/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&gt;https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer-example/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 depends on &lt;denchmark-link:https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&gt;https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,  will complain about the packages that nnstreamer-example depends on. It better to move the nnstreamer-example package from the nnstreamer-example ppa to the nnstreamer ppa.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RockeyLuo&gt;@RockeyLuo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Anyway, have you added &lt;denchmark-link:https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&gt;https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as one of your APT repository/source lists?

 I agreed with your opinion. Separated ppa just cause confusion for user.
I will move the  to nnstreamer ppa.

As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wooksong&gt;@wooksong&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned, you wouldn't add nnstreamer ppa (&lt;denchmark-link:https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&gt;https://launchpad.net/~nnstreamer/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
Now  package is supported by nnstreamer ppa.
Please try this
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:nnstreamer-example/ppa
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nnstreamer/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nnstreamer
$ sudo apt-get install nnstreamer-example
$ cd /usr/lib/nnstreamer/bin # binary install directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

@RockeyLuo Is it resolved?
Hi everyone，
Thank you for your immediate reply.
I just install the binary pkg of nnstreamer from PPA on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-70-generic aarch64).
Nothing is done before the PPA install, is there any dependency need install?
Is the OS/Hardware not compatible?
After the new CMD, the nnstreamer-tensorflow is still not installed.
Here are the logs:
"
$ sudo apt-get install nnstreamer-example
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable

		It appears that we do not publish tensorflow for aarch64 while there is dependency on tensorflow even in aarch64 build.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wooksong&gt;@wooksong&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will fix (cut the dependency) it for aarch64-Ubuntu. (None of us appears to have tested Ubuntu-aarch64 :(  )

		Fix submitted: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer-example/pull/236&gt;nnstreamer/nnstreamer-example#236&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

PPA will soon deploy fixed versions. (within a few hours)
