	<summary>Prediction explainations are incorrect</summary>
	<description>
Prediction explainations seem to indicate that all the columns are "missing" no matter what combination of columns we feed that them.
This is rather bad, but I can't find an obvious reason why this is happening, will try to fix this asap but logging the issue so I make sure I don't forget about it if I switch to something else.
