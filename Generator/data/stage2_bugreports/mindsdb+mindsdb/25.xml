	<summary>Getting None as prediction value and prediction confidence</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I trained some data and I got around 73% accuracy, so I started predicting by passing different independent variables. Then I got predicting value and confidence both as None. Especially when I include date in the "when"

It has to give some reasonable predicting value, and prediction confidence(probably some number for confidence)

Please find the screenshot

		Thank you Surendra, can you share your training set and the train script.

		And you can find the when condition from the screen shot, and please use the below data and ignore previous one

 Did you train model from this data successfully? I try to train model from this dataset but there are some errors with parsing the Date and Time.

		With AirQualityUCI 2.zip, I can able to train. May I know which os you are using?

		Yes, I am using the AirQualityUCI 2 data. I got Ubuntu(16.04) but I don't think that the problem is because of the OS.

		Should be taken care of when PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/pull/141&gt;#141&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  is merged.
For the tests I ran, I modified the data in  as follows:

Replaced ; with \t since we currently don't support that separator
Removed the Empty Column since we currently don't support `` values (aka empty values) for the span of a whole column, as that will mean we can't really determine any datatype.
Replaced all the ( and ) in the header with _ (In hindsight this might have been uncessary, I did this before changing ; to \t, since I thought it might have been causing the issue)

The result I got for your exact prediction request was:
CO_GT --&gt; -280.4719
CO_GT_confidence --&gt; 0.020009895099618348
The code I used was as follow
from mindsdb import Predictor


mdb = Predictor(name='co_pollutant')

mdb.learn(from_data="AirQualityUCI.csv", to_predict='CO_GT')

print('------------------------------------------------------------Done training------------------------------------------------------------')

predicted = mdb.predict(when={
    'Date':'11/03/2020',
    'Time':'18.00.00',
    'NMHC_GT': 1360.0,
    'AH': 0.655
})
print('------------------------------------------------------------Preidiction output------------------------------------------------------------')
for val in predicted:
    print(val['CO_GT'])
    print(val['CO_GT_confidence'])
