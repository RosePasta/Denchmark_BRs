	<summary>'Predictor' object has no attribute 'load'</summary>
	<description>
Your Environment

Python version:
3.7.6
Pip version:
20.1.1
Operating system:
macOS
Python environment used (e.g. venv, conda):
Mindsdb version you tried to install:
1.99.11
Additional info if applicable:
Same code was working on a previous MDB version (unsure which, though installed late May).

Describe the bug
Getting AttributeError: 'Predictor' object has no attribute 'load' when trying to load predictor zip file.
To Reproduce
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
import mindsdb
from mindsdb import *
import csv
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score

def run():
	backend='lightwood'
	predictor = mindsdb.Predictor(name='predict_name')
        predictor.load('predict_file.zip')
        predictions = predictor.predict('csv_file.csv')
        pred_val = [int(x['position']) for x in predictions]

	pred_val = [int(x['position']) for x in predictions]
	pred_conf = [float(x['position_confidence']) for x in predictions]
	real_val = [int(x) for x in list(pd.read_csv(open('csv_file.csv', 'r'))['position'])]
	accuracy = balanced_accuracy_score(real_val, pred_val)
	#show additional info for each transaction row
	additional_info = [x for x in predictions]
      
	df = pd.DataFrame(additional_info)

	print('DataFrame:\n', df)
	print(pred_val)
	print(pred_conf)
	return {
		'accuracy': accuracy,
		'backend': backend,
		'additional info': additional_info
	}

# Run as main
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(run())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
Print df and lists with predictions and confidence.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/billGDF&gt;@billGDF&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the load function was moved inside the functional controller. So now you can use it as:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mindsdb.F.import_model(model_archive_path)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I will update the docs about this. Thanks for reporting it.

		Thanks very much &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZoranPandovski&gt;@ZoranPandovski&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - that fixes the error.
Now having issue with 'Could not load module DataTransformer'
This is after model files loaded and DataExtractor module loaded. The data_transformer folder and script are in place in the phases directory.

 could you share the dataset, or a part of it, for reproduction of the problem?

 any update on this ? giving the full error log would help here,  might be caused by a lot of things (unless there isn't an error log... which would be strange)

		Alternatively, as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/btseytlin&gt;@btseytlin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned, if the dataset is open sharing that would help us debug internally.
