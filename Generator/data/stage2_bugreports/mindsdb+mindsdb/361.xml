	<summary>Mindsdb Model prediction same value for all testcase</summary>
	<description>
Your Environment

Python version: 3.7.4
Pip version: 19.2.3
Operating system: Window 10
Python environment used (e.g. venv, conda):
Mindsdb version you tried to install: 1.9.2
Additional info if applicable:

Describe the bug
After i train the model with train file, i apply test file but get same value of all test cases
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, for example:

Download the dataset from link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/statistical-learning-Regression
Run the code: mdb = Predictor(name='multilabel') mdb.learn( use_gpu=True, ignore_columns=['url'], from_data=train_df, backend='lightwood', equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories=True, to_predict=' shares' # Array with the names of the columns we want to predict )
You should see the error: .C:\Users\PC'\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\site-packages\scipy\stats\stats.py:2315: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide   return (a - mns) / sstd C:\Users\PC'\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\site-packages\sklearn\neighbors\lof.py:253: UserWarning: n_neighbors (20) is greater than the total number of samples (1). n_neighbors will be set to (n_samples - 1) for estimation.   % (self.n_neighbors, n_samples)) Can't disable output on Jupyter notebook Can't disable output on Jupyter notebook Can't disable output on Jupyter notebook C:\Users\PC'\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\site-packages\scipy\stats\stats.py:2315: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide   return (a - mns) / sstd C:\Users\PC'\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\site-packages\sklearn\neighbors\lof.py:253: UserWarning: n_neighbors (20) is greater than the total number of samples (1). n_neighbors will be set to (n_samples - 1) for estimation.   % (self.n_neighbors, n_samples)) Can't disable output on Jupyter notebook INFO:mindsdb-logger-19c0772e-2d05-11ea-a55e-5e454016a44a:F:\Program\python37\lib\site-packages\mindsdb\libs\phases\base_module.py:57 - [END] ModelAnalyzer, execution time: 70.552 seconds

Expected behavior
I think the predictor will predict difference value of 'share'

		Hello,
You seem to have an error during training, but I can't replicate it locally using the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import mindsdb

mdb = mindsdb.Predictor(name='multilabel')

mdb.learn(use_gpu=False, ignore_columns=['url'], from_data='TrainReg.xlsx', backend='lightwood', equal_accuracy_for_all_output_categories=True, to_predict=' shares', stop_training_in_x_seconds=50)

predictions = mdb.predict(when_data='TestReg.xlsx')

for pred in predictions:
    print(pred)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As for the value of share it does seem to be the same (28) all the time, I'm unsure why this is, it might be that there's not enough data in the TestReg.xlsx for the model to make any good prediction or it might be an error during training. I'll try to look at this more when I have more time.

		Alright, no more updates here for almost 2 months, I think it's safe to close, if you got a further update/question feel free to repoen this issue or ping me to do so... or just create a new one :)
