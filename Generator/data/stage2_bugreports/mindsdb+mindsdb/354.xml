	<summary>Travis tests randomly failing</summary>
	<description>
I've noticed maybe twice or thrice that travis tests for seemingly ok changes fail due to too many logs being displayed whilst lightwood trains, the error being outputted is:
WARNING:root:Occurance of nan value in encoded numerical value: [nan, nan, nan, nan]
This happens when training, not only in the model analysis phase when such behavior may be expected. Better logging might help us figure out the cause.
For an example, see: &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.org/mindsdb/mindsdb/jobs/624239590&gt;https://travis-ci.org/mindsdb/mindsdb/jobs/624239590&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

On suspicion might be that the model always predicts nan, but that doesn't explain the amount of logs in the model analysis phase.

		Still haven't found a reason for this, but will hopefully re-work the lightwood numerical encoder soon due to other changes that were proposed by Jorge, so hopefully that will fix it.

		Logging issue in the model analyzer, since it was feeding all-None columns to lightwood and lightwood was giving warnings, disabled lightwood logging for the model analyzer predict runs for now.
