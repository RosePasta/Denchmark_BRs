	<summary>Installation issues on Windows with Python 3.8.5</summary>
	<description>
There is a torch installation issue when installing MindsDB on Windows with Python 3.8.5 version. We need to check if pytorch supports that version on Windows and if not include that in python_requires.

		I used the method provided in the readme and had the issue initially. But it seems after re-install it went away.
Here's the version i'm running locally
Requirement already satisfied: torch&gt;=1.1.0 in ... (from flair&gt;=0.5-&gt;mindsdb-native==2.13.0-&gt;mindsdb) (1.4.0+cpu)

		Hey, I've recently installed PyTorch on windows with python 3.8 and cudatoolkit 10.2. I found no issues in the installation. Could you elaborate more about the issue you are facing or maybe some error logs?
