	<summary>Maximum retry error</summary>
	<description>
Cannot access the CSV file for training. It says maximum retry exceeded with URL: /mindsdb/mindsdb/master/docs/examples/basic/home_rentals.csv, even though not more than 2 requests were made. This popped up the first time.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
As mentioned in the docs,
import mindsdb mdb = mindsdb.Predictor(name='real_estate_model') mdb.learn( from_data="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/master/docs/examples/basic/home_rentals.csv" to_predict='rental_price')
Expected behavior:
The model should have been trained from given csv

		Hi,
this issue seems to be with the given url: &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/master/docs/examples/basic/home_rentals.csv&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/master/docs/examples/basic/home_rentals.csv&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, I can use it just fine, and the issue seems to be related with the certificate.
Do you use a weird list of certificates on your machine ?
What happens with you run wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/master/docs/examples/basic/home_rentals.csv' ? or wget 'https://github.com' ?
The issue might have been temporary, just a coincidence (I remember some news about an important root cert becoming invalid for a short while a few days ago). Could you re-try the same code again now, just to make sure it wasn't that ?
One way or another, the issue is not mindsdb related, hence why I marked it as invalid, but I'd like to help you get the library running.
If you just want to try mindsdb and don't care about using that particular URL feel free to just mindsdb/docs/examples/basic/home_rentals.csv, which is the exact same file (download manually from the browser or from your local mindsdb directory if you installed it via cloning it from git)

		I've checked this locally and it works great. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/prayanshratan&gt;@prayanshratan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Can you try and run it again, maybe it was network error on your side.

I think now downloading raw content from Github is going to start giving issues because we will need to provide a key.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please, move all example files to an s3 bucket and make it public and update the examples
