 are you able to replicate this?

		No, it's a windows specific error (hence the DLL thing, that's windows failing to import something).
Considering the error is " The paging file is too small" it might just be a memory issue? As in, it seems that the issue is with from torch._C import * which is just an import statement from torch, nothing special.

 , if you have time, can you try running this on your Windows machine and seeing if you can replicate.

		This is not related to the specific MindsDB version or a dataset. I am getting the from torch._C import * (ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found error on many examples at the moment. It is a torch windows issue.
Note that torch as a dependency to lightwood is installed:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip freeze 
torch==1.4.0
torchvision==0.5.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Tested on Windows 10 with python 3.7.4 and python 3.8.0 using venv.
Using torch tensors to fit a two-layer network to random data as an example throws the same error.  I will check the torch issues to get more information, but so far this is not related to MindsDB or Lightwood. We can leave this issue open until we know how this can be resolved and reference the fix.

 did you find any update on this? (e.g. potential torch version or some other dependency change that will resolve this).
Does this mean that lightwood will now fail on every windows machine or does this only happen in some situations? If so, what are those situations? We can try guarding against them when running stuff on windows.

		I have updated the installation docs for Windows to specify the Conda or Anaconda installation. George changed the Lightwood install to use the torch+cpu version as a default. I guess we can close this for now.
