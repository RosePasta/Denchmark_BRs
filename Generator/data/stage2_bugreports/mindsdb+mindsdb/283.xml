	<summary>Issues with ludwig backend and large numbers</summary>
	<description>
The Ludwig backend seems to always return nan if feed only numerical values bigger than 2^20 as inputs.
We don't want to do normalization inside mindsdb, so not sure how to address this yet, we should look if it's an easy to fix issue in ludwig or if it might have already been fixed.
This is a followup to  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues/137&gt;#137&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
