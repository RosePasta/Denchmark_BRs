		Any update on this?
I see this error even with the very first basic example.

Ludwig does get installed via the requirements.txt file or (on windows) the requirements.win.txt file.


The "fix" that you have in that PR is not required and it's not the proper way to add dependencies to a python package I'm afraid


The most likely reason Ludwig was not installed for you is because you cloned mindsdb and didn't install requirements.txt. This issue simply refers to a specific edge case that ludwig cannot handle

		Ok,  at  some point this was fixed... I'm not sure when specifically, but testing this exact situation (sequence column feed in the model and manually emptying out some values.
ModelAnalyzer also work well, which means None typed Sequence columns are also supported.
thus, I'll consider this to be "fixed" at some unknown point in the past.
