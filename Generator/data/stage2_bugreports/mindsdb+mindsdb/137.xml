	<summary>Predictions with only numerical inputs return all values in the predicted columns as "nan"</summary>
	<description>
Same as the bug reported in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues/135&gt;#135&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but I mistakenly interpreted the cause of that to be the multi label return, actually, I was confounded by the fact that the only test where all our inputs are numerical had multiple labels.

		So, this seems to come about due to the fact that the input numbers are too big. The issue manifests itself when ludwig is feed large numerical values and/or expected to output large numerical values.
I'm not 100% sure what the actual limit is, I will dig into it further when I have the time. But, since there seems to be no easy fix (other than normalizing the numbers ourselves before feeding the to ludwig), I'll abandon it for now. Presumably most of the datasets we get won't include a lot of very large (above 2^20 or so) numerical values.
