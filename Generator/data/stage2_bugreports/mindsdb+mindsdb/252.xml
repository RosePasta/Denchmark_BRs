Describe the bug
When installing mindsdb, the following error message is output with the following command.
command:
pip install --requirement reqs.txt
error message:
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch&gt;=1.0.1.post2 (from lightwood==0.6.4-&gt;-r
reqs.txt (line 25)) (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch&gt;=1.0.1.post2 (from lightwood==0.6.4-&gt;-r reqs.txt (line 25))
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: windows 10


I think pytorch for Windows is currently not available through PYPI, so using the commands in &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org&gt;https://pytorch.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is a better way.

		Since this is a lightwood install issue I will move it there.
As for mindsdb, I need to figure out if there's a way to make installing the given learning backends (ludwig and lightwood) as optional requirements, since both aren't necessarily required.

		I had the same issue, using Anaconda:
Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/74/f5/a14c01bcc9dbf99fd164fe2c55229569456f991a162daf62d3275714d241/schema-0.7.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl Collecting torch==1.1.0 (from lightwood&gt;=0.6.8-&gt;-r reqs.txt (line 19)) Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.1.0 (from lightwood&gt;=0.6.8-&gt;-r reqs.txt (line 19)) (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2) No matching distribution found for torch==1.1.0 (from lightwood&gt;=0.6.8-&gt;-r reqs.txt (line 19))
I then tried to install from the pytorch page, as above. That got me pytorch, but still lots of other problems. First:
File "C:\Users\mikem\Anaconda3\envs\py3.7\lib\site-packages\mindsdb\libs\data_types\mindsdb_logger.py", line 3, in 
import colorlog
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorlog'
Manual reinstall of colorlog let to more errors in runtime, including the 'exit' error (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues/258&gt;#258&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
Also, the install tries to install spacy, but yields:
Failed building wheel for spacy
Running setup.py clean for spacy
Failed to build spacy
Could not build wheels for spacy which use PEP 517 and cannot be installed directly

		This should be fixed in the latest mindsdb version. Could you try installing from pip again &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ViennaMike&gt;@ViennaMike&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I can try either later today or tomorrow. Do I follow the steps for a
Windows 10 install which use a requirements.txt file and then a pip install
without requirements, or just a single line pip install?

		First, since I usually use Python version 3.7.3, so I tried the following command to install pytorch, but got the same error message.
pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu100/torch-1.1.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
Next, I installed Python 3.6.8 and tried the command
pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/torch-1.1.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
but resulted in the same error.
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch&gt;=1.1.0.post2 (from lightwood==0.7.3-&gt;mindsdb) (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch&gt;=1.1.0.post2 (from lightwood==0.7.3-&gt;mindsdb)
In my enviroment, Windows 10 and Python 3.7.3, mindsdb 1.2.6 and lightwood 0.6.4 seem to work without problems.

		<comment id='12' author='YottaGin' date='2019-07-20T13:29:39Z'>
		Try installing via:
pip install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb.git@install_fix
It seems that the issue is with the fact that lightwood &amp; mindsdb require dynamic installation via running setup.py, but pip is downloading the wheel instead, and the whl is compiled for OSX at the moment.

		So, the bug has to do with the data from .learn not being saved properly, it seems, but I can't replicate it in any way.
Can you run the exact same script, but, right after the import mindsdb line, add:
mindsdb.CONFIG.MINDSDB_STORAGE_PATH = 'C:/some/path'
Where 'C:/some/path' is just a random empty folder your have access to, and see if the script is able to run that way.
Alternatively, if it still fails, can you send me the three files that get generated inside 'C:/some/path' ?

		OK, it ran that time. Result seems rather weird:  "The predicted price is
$17 with 0.02058924200177029 confidence"

Four files were created in the folder (attached).

		Hmh, that's a rather bad prediction, partially due to the lack of input data. I'll modify the example later to use a realistic input for predict and not yield such an outrageous prediction :p
However, if it did run this time, than the issue is some sort of pathing/permission issue with the default storage directory.
Are you running this in a windows VM or on a physical machine ? Also, could you run one last script and give me the output ?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import mindsdb

print(mindsdb.CONFIG.MINDSDB_STORAGE_PATH)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is just to figure out where mindsdb is storing files by default on your machine.
Anyway, thanks for all the help in figuring out the cause of this bug... still unsure how to replicate it but at least I've narrowed down the cause :)

		Sure, no problem. I'm running on a Windows physical machine, using an
Anaconda environment. Here's the results:

C:\Users\mikem\Anaconda3\envs\mindsdb\lib\site-packages\mindsdb_storage\1_3_1

Happy to try to help get this sorted out. Mindsdb looks like an interesting
and useful package. I first heard about it on the  Podcast.__init_ podcast.
