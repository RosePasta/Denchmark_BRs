	<summary>Change presistent data</summary>

A few changes should be made to the shared transaction state:


Light persistent metadata (current to the similar persistent_transaction_metadata). Easy to save and transfer to a server (in order to generate pretty looking logs and aggregate statistics about various models). Ideally, this shouldn't go above 10-100MB or so.


Heavy persistent metadata. This would include stuff like the Probabilistic Validator, or the weights of the ML model itself (unless the backend saves it separately).


Non persistent metadata. This would include what's currently in the transaction metadata, but with less duplication (currently there's a lot of duplication between the persistent and non persistend metadata)


Changes will be made as to how this is also saved:


The 2 persistent states will be pickled throughout the training and predicting and saved to files in mindsdb's storage directory. This should also deal with the concurrency issues outlined in #13.


We'll also have some helper functions to move this pickled metadata into various databases (mongo, mariadb, postgres... etc), in case users want to use a database instead of a directory for storage. But they will be treated as binary blobs (unlike now, when the data in mongo is an actual BSON) and simply unpickled when they are read and overwritten when they are inserted/updated.
