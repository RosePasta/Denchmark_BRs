	<summary>import mindsdb fails in jupyter</summary>
	<description>
Hi guys, me again ðŸ˜„
I think one of the last releases (in the last 2-3 days, it was working before) broke something on the Jupyter side.
Your sample notebook in Colab doesn't work anymore either:
import mindsdb
the problem:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;usage: ipykernel_launcher.py [-h] [--api API] [--config CONFIG]
ipykernel_launcher.py: error: unrecognized arguments: -f /root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-3debf89d-abca-491d-b4d6-9bf8ed27e9b3.json
An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.

SystemExit: 2
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2890: UserWarning: To exit: use 'exit', 'quit', or Ctrl-D.
  warn("To exit: use 'exit', 'quit', or Ctrl-D.", stacklevel=1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I could be wrong, but it could be something related to the args, probably to argparse.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lukeb88&gt;@lukeb88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks for reporting this. I guess the Google collab example we have is outdated with old version, I will try with the new version and give you more info.

 As I mentioned above the example was quite outdated. I have created a new example that will be merged in stable in 2 days. You can check the collab example here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qnH4bhTKvm6mEyV8nAoK9uMZm8HV_gwE?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qnH4bhTKvm6mEyV8nAoK9uMZm8HV_gwE?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		thanks, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZoranPandovski&gt;@ZoranPandovski&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so it is not correct to install and import , but, instead the correct version is  as you did in the notebook that you linked?

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lukeb88&gt;@lukeb88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Yes, now mindsdb_native contains only the native Python module, while mindsdb have the HTTP interface and  MySql API for database integrations. You can still import everything from native through mindsdb, but for simplicity, I've only used mindsdb_native in the notebook.
