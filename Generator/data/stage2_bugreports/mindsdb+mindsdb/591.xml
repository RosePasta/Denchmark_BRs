		to create predictor:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CREATE TABLE test.pm(
	`Measurement date` DateTime,
	`Station code` String,
	Address String,
	Latitude Float32,
	Longitude Float32,
	SO2 Decimal32(5),
	NO2 Decimal32(5),
	O3 Decimal32(5),
	CO Decimal32(5),
	PM10 Decimal32(1),
	`PM2.5` Decimal32(1)
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
  ORDER BY `Measurement date`;

clickhouse-client --password 201287 -u default --date_time_input_format=best_effort --query="INSERT INTO test.pm FORMAT CSV" &lt; Measurement_summary.csv


insert into mindsdb.predictors (name, predict, select_data_query) values ('pm1', 'CO', 'select * from test.pm limit 500')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Cause of issue: field Station code is String, but when we insert predictor, ClickhouseDS creates from 'select_data_query', and this datasourse ['data_analysis_v2']['Station code']['typing']['data_type'] = 'Numeric'. After that i make query with where = {'Station code': '101''}, but in result of query get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;res._data = {'Measurement date': [None], 'Station code': [101], 'Address': ['None'], 'Latitude': [None], 'Longitude': [None], 'SO2': ['None'], 'NO2': [None], 'O3': [None], 'CO': ['0.5'], 'PM10': [None], 'PM2.5': [None], '__observed_CO': ['None'], 'CO_model_confidence': [0.9999999999976197], 'CO_confidence': [0.14998360676765238], 'model_CO': ['0.5']}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After, in query-postprocessing, i compare check conditions for rows, and find what 101 != '101', so this row go throw away.
As i thinks, best place to fix it will be ClickhouseDS (and other DS constructors). Types of columns should be defined from types of columns in database.

		Types of columns should be defined from types of columns in database.
Disagree with this in general, in the case of number vs string it might make sense though.
The issue is that e.g. we might actually want to treat Station code as a number, not a string, inside Mindsdb.
I don't think this issue is that important since I assume most of the time people will use select_data_query instead of single row predictions using WHERE based filtering, but I can see it being confusing when people do fix it.
I'll chew on it for a bit, I don't think there's an obvious fix. Is there a way to have clickhouse allow users to input any type for a given column in the WHERE ? Make a String|Int enum we can use for things we detect as Int, Float... etc ?

		Is there a way to have clickhouse allow users to input any type for a given column in the WHERE ?
User can input both, string and int in 'where'. But, if user input value as string (as it in database), than result will empty (because mindsdb return Station code in prediction result as int, and '101' != 101). Overwise, if user input Station code as int, than he get result. But it not obvious for user.

		Other issue occurred with 'Timestump' field. When create predictor from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb-examples/tree/master/others/air_pollution_seoul&gt;air_pollution_seoul&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , than predictor table field for 'Measurement date' get 'DateTime' type. Model has 'Timestamp' type for this field.
When make query:

then  called with when_data = 
but in prediction result 'Measurement date' returned as float-timestamp.
