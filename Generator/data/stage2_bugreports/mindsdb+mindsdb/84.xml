	<summary>Error while training model on a kaggle dataset</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Error "could not convert string to float: 'SC/PARIS 2131'" while training the model on Kaggle dataset for beginner competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from disaster.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Download the train.csv from here.
Run

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from mindsdb import *

MindsDB().learn(
    from_data="train.csv",
    predict='Survived',
    model_name='titanic_model'
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


See error.

Expected behavior
The best-trained model should be returned.

		thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ayush9398&gt;@ayush9398&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Should be fixed in v.1.0 once the PR is approved.
The fix won't be coming to master in a while, but if you wish to try this dataset I'll provide you with instructions as to how to clone &amp; use v.1.0 as soon as the PR is discussed and merged.

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/George3d6&gt;@George3d6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that would be really helpful.
Please let me know if I can help with any issue, I have some knowledge about machine learning and deep learning with python.

		To use v.1.0, which contains the fix, you can:
pip3 uninstall mindsdb
cd /a/dir/
git clone git@github.com:mindsdb/mindsdb.git
cd mindsdb
git checkout v.1.0
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/a/dir/mindsdb
Note, we don't necessarily recommend using v.1.0, since it's still in active development. But, if you want to try Mindsdb on your dataset, this is the only option at the moment :(
If it still doesn't work, it might be because the current HEAD on v.1.0 is broken in some other way.
I'll let you know when a new stable release that includes this bugfix comes about.

		v.1.0 is merged in master now, so this should be fixed.
