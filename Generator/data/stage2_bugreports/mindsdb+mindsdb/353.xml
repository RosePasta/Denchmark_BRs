		Hey, I am willing to take up this issue.
Can you please let me know how can I recreate the error and which files I need to look upon.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Bhanu-mbvg&gt;@Bhanu-mbvg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I'm so terribly sorry, I was taking some day off coding when you posted this and it slipped my radar once I came back.
Are you still interested in working on this issue ? If so I can provide you with some guidance about how to go about it, though do keep in mind it might be a bit difficult (e.g. it might take 4-6 hours to someone unfamiliar with the mindsdb codebase to solve it and test it), but I'd be a good introduction if you're interested in using and/or contributing to mindsdb in the future :)
Again, sorry for my reply being basically 2 months delayed :(

		This is now fixed in the new model analyzer :)
