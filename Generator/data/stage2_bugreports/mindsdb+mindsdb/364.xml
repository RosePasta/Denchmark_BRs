		Fixed in a PR that should be done in 20 minutes, also went ahead and added support for importing multiple models at once while I was at it.
Thank you for finding this out &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/surendra1472&gt;@surendra1472&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I had actually forgotten we even had that  function, I was just about to re-write it in order to more easily deploy models on other machines :P
