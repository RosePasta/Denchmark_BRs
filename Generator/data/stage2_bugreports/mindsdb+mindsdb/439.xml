		That's odd, I assume it may be related to python 3.8 (?)
I think the only person that can quickly debug this at the moment is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/torrmal&gt;@torrmal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , but I'm not sure he has time.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/miko99x&gt;@miko99x&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Would you be able to create a virutal environment with python 3.7 instead and try installing in that?

 I installed python 3.7.6 and under this version I can run it successfully.

		Alright, well. That's as much as I can do for now... we want to get this to run on python 3.8 but there seem to be torch issues on some environments and we haven't been able to find a quick way to resolve them.

		Leaving this open and will track any python 3.8 + OSX updated here.

		There is a quite similar issue opened on PyTorch forum. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/miko99x&gt;@miko99x&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Did you use brew to install Python? Can you check this &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/installation-problem-library-not-loaded-rpath-libc-1-dylib/36802/4&gt;https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/installation-problem-library-not-loaded-rpath-libc-1-dylib/36802/4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
