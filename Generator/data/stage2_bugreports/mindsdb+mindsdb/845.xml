	<summary>Uploading dataset not working</summary>
	<description>
Uploading the following dataset: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/private-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmarks/datasets/us_health_insurance/data.csv&gt;https://github.com/mindsdb/private-benchmarks/blob/master/benchmarks/datasets/us_health_insurance/data.csv&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seems to fail.
I'm not uploading directly but rather doing:
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
and then
df.to_csv('file.csv')
and then uploading the file.csv, but I'm fairly sure uploading the file directly should have the same effects.
It fails when creating the sqllite database.

 That because you need do , otherwise it will be unnamed serial column in csv. Additionally i added check to unique names in PR, since it possible give same name to multiple columns in DS
