	<description>
Describe the bug
I took a CSV file containg Date column. While generating a model on a date column getting the error could not convert string to date error

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Attached CSV in pdf format
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/files/2698791/marvel-wikia.pdf&gt;marvel-wikia.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

train.py :
from mindsdb import *
MindsDB().learn(
from_file="D://mindsdb/basic/marvel-wikia/marvel-wikia.csv", # the path to the file where we can learn from
predict='FIRST_APPEARANCE', # the column we want to learn to predict given all the data in the file
model_name='marvel_model' # the name of this model
)
Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

 , marvel-wikia.pdf does not have 'Date' column, can you check once.

@geetab19 , marvel-wikia.pdf does not have 'Date' column, can you check once.

Yes it does. It's the -2 column; the pdf shows it from page 95.

		The pdf you provided seems to contain 2 CSV schemas with different columns.
Could you provide the actual .csv file you are using for training ?

		Github doesn't supporting .csv so uploading xlsx

		Converted to csv and data looks fine, at the moment I'm unsure why training is failing, since there are other confounding issues on the dev branch, but I'll try to come back to you in a few days and try to include a fix for whatever is happening here in the next release.

		This should be fixed by PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/pull/141&gt;#141&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Quite a nice dataset, found a lot of issues using it.
The code I used to test is:
from mindsdb import Predictor


mdb = Predictor(name='marvel')

mdb.learn(from_data="marvel-wikia.xlsx", to_predict='FIRST_APPEARANCE')
