	<summary>MindsDB deletes trained models tables on start</summary>
	<description>
At the start of the MindsDB server, all of the tables with trained models are deleted inside the mindsdb database. Check &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/stable/mindsdb/integrations/mariadb/mariadb.py#L78&gt;https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/stable/mindsdb/integrations/mariadb/mariadb.py#L78&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This is not a bug. When mindsdb starting, it delete, and then create again all tables in target database related to mindsdb. Otherwise it need to add bunch of checks on start:
what predictors was deleted?
is it predictor table refer to same predictor in mindsb?
is no changes in predictor table fields?
may be we change something in struct of mindsb.predictors?
or may be mindsb password in config was changed so we need recreate all tables?
etc...
Thus much easier (and real it quick) just recreate all at start

		As we talked on slack the trained model table disappears. So, when you stop/start the server you will need to retrain all models since the tables are missing from mindsdb database.

		Instead of saving the models in the location provided in config.json, MindsDB saves them in the virtual enviroment /var directory. The get_models will check for models in the location from config, but mindsdb_native saves them in different dir.
