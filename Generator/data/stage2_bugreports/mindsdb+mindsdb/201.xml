	<summary>Issues calling fileno and dup2 on jupyter notebook</summary>
	<description>
Jupyter notebook does not support calling sys.stdout.fileno  and os.dup2.
There are both functions used to disable the ludwig output, simply surrounding the calls with a try/except doesn't seem to fix the issue, since jupyter itself crashes the process when it reaches that call instead of throwing.
We also can't figure out whether or not jupyter is running since python itself doesn't expose the frontend being used inside the process.
So... trying to come up with ideas about how to do it, will update anything I find here.
