	<summary>Predictor trained using GPU cannot be used in a CPU-only machine</summary>
	<description>
Your Environment

Python version: 3.8.0
Pip version: 20.2.3
Operating system:
Mindsdb version: 2.8.3.
Ubuntu 20.04
Mindsdb and mysql client are located in different machines.

The bug
I am running mindsdb in a machine with no gpu, so I added the parameter "use_gpu": false in its config.json. Also, there is only one trained predictor, but it was trained in another machine with gpu.
Then, a mysql client is connected by a python script correctly, but the select query to make a prediction is not run properly and the following error appears:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR:mindsdb-logger-core-logger:/home/abmo/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mindsdb_native/libs/controllers/transaction.py:163 - Could not load module ModelInterface

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, it seems that if the model was trained using GPU, it could not be used in a CPU-only machine via MySQL API.
Thanks in advance!

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abmo&gt;@abmo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , you really helping us :)
'use_gpu' key in config has no effect anymore. In early 2.x.x versions we had mess in config and storage dirs, now config more strict and should update self structure between versions. We will update 'config' page in our documentations very soon.
Going back to issue: we cheking it intently. If you can, please say:

do you know version of mindsdb, with predictor was trained?
can you say current mindsb_native and lightwood version?

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python -c 'import mindsdb_native as m; import lightwood as l; print(f"native {m.__version__}"); print(f"lightwood {l.__version__}");'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi!
The predictor was trained in a machine with the following versions:

mindsdb 2.7.2
native 2.7.0
lightwood 0.39.0

But then, this predictor has been moved to another machine with these versions:

mindsdb 2.8.3
native 2.12.0
lightwood 0.41.0

		Fixed now in lightwood.
