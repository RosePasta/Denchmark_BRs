	<summary>Second run fails with `FileNotFound` error inside the `mindsdb_storage`</summary>
	<description>
Your Environment

Python version: Python3
Pip version: pip3
Operating system: Ubuntu 18
Python environment used (e.g. venv, conda): -
Mindsdb version you tried to install: 1.13.12
Additional info if applicable:

Describe the bug
I trained a model in Codelab and exported it as a ZIP to my local machine. Now I'm using it a script to predict.  It ran for the first time without an issue. The consecutive runs are now experiencing an issue like below.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1391468/75864395-ecee5800-5e27-11ea-8b2f-dce2d6f75bfc.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

My script is very simple,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python3
import mindsdb
from mindsdb import *
import csv

predictor = mindsdb.Predictor(name='Incidents')
predictor.load_model('./models/Incidents.zip')

with open('./test_incidents.csv') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are {", ".join(row)}')
            line_count += 1
        else:
            r = predictor.predict(when={'Description': row[0]})
            print(r['Category'])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behaviour, for example:

Run the above script with a downloaded model ZIP.
Rerun the script

Expected behaviour
It should run without an error
Additional context
I'm new to the MindsBD, I'm trying it out.

		Hmhm, there might be an issue with calling load_model twice.. I'll try to reproduce tomorrow.
Did you upgrade mindsdb versions between the two runs ?

 No I didn't. Later I updated to see if upgrading would solve the issue, but it too didn't.

I am unable to replicate this bug locally, calling load_model multiple times on the same .zip file seems to work just fine.
Please provide the .zip file you used here (Incidents.zip) so I can try and see what happens when running your code.
Also, please try loading with way:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;predictor = mindsdb.Predictor(name='loader')

predictor.load_model('./models/Incidents.zip')
predictor = mindsdb.Predictor(name='Incidents')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and tell me if you still encounter the bug
i.e. just replace your code with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import mindsdb
from mindsdb import *
import csv

predictor = mindsdb.Predictor(name='loader')

predictor.load_model('./models/Incidents.zip')
predictor = mindsdb.Predictor(name='Incidents')

with open('./test_incidents.csv') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        if line_count == 0:
            print(f'Column names are {", ".join(row)}')
            line_count += 1
        else:
            r = predictor.predict(when={'Description': row[0]})
            print(r['Category'])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 I tried your new code snippet. but it also same. Actually, my  directory is totally empty.
My ZIP is 275Mb large, how you want it to be shared? I can't put it in a public forum, it was trained on some corporate data.

		I see... let me think about this for a second. What's likely happening here is that some of the pathing is not set correctly when the model is imported... but it makes no sense why it would have worked with the first time and not the second time... are you sure the .zip file itself has not been corrupted ?

		Ok, I need a bit more info:


How did you install mindsdb


What's the default mindsdb storage path ? You can find it by running this python script:


&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import mindsdb
print(mindsdb.config.CONFIG.MINDSDB_STORAGE_PATH)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

No, the ZIP is all good.


How did you install mindsdb?
using pip3 install mindsdb


What's the default mindsdb storage path?
MINDSDB_STORAGE_PATH seems /home/myhome/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mindsdb/mindsdb_storage/1_13_12.
I put this print(mindsdb.config.CONFIG.MINDSDB_STORAGE_PATH) inside my script also, it's same. This is not the path MindsDB is looking for the models when loading models.

		Hmh... interesting, can you try to uninstall mindsdb and install as user, then import the model again and see if it fixes the problem.
So
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip3 uninstall mindsdb
pip3 install mindsdb --user
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/George3d6&gt;@George3d6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried! but it's still same.
MINDSDB_STORAGE_PATH is /home/myhome/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mindsdb/mindsdb_storage/1_13_12
but model is checked in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages
Is there a caching mechanism or something?

		No, if this is the case that means that something is going wrong with the pathing changes on importing, looking at it again now.

		<comment id='11' author='agentmilindu' date='2020-03-09T18:11:21Z'>
		Ok... so a new release should be out on pypi in 20 minutes and I think that has a fix to what might be the issue here, where you trying to import 2 models at once from the zip file by any chance ?.
Anyway, install it via pip3 install mindsdb --upgrade --user and then, if it successfully updates to 1.13.15 try loading the model again.

		I upgraded a day back and I got the following error
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1391468/76451837-1134d080-63f6-11ea-8a64-d574b54870f8.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Then I upgraded today, and I'm back with the old error.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1391468/76451864-1bef6580-63f6-11ea-8474-74bd8a5d7d11.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

very very weird!

 do you know if this is still an issue?

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/torrmal&gt;@torrmal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it's an issue in the sense that the last screenshot there shows an issue where the lightwood version mis-matches the lightwood version the model was trained with... which is something we still haven't figured out how to handle (or if it's worth handling at all).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/agentmilindu&gt;@agentmilindu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , sorry for not getting back to you sooner. If possible please go ahead and try installing whatever mindsdb version you want that's &gt; 1.13.15 and then retrain your model before you make any predictions (achieved via the ) function.
The problem in your last report there seem to be coming from a model that was trained with a different version of one of the mindsdb dependencies than the one you had installed while predicting.

		No updates in a while, so I will be closing this, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/agentmilindu&gt;@agentmilindu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  feel free to reopen or create a new issue if you still have problems.
