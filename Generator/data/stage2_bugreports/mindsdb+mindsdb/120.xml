	<summary>Feedback predict column into timeseries</summary>
	<description>
We should be feeding back the previous values of the predict column as a sequential column when making timeseries predictions.
Consider doing this by using the ludwig model (label1, label2, label3... etc as separate columns,  rather than 1 large array), at least when using the ludwig backend.
This could also cause issues in certain predict cases, depending on how we train our model. So we should train the model to handle both the case when predictions are available and the case when they aren't or provide an argument for it in the Preidctor or in the learn interface.
