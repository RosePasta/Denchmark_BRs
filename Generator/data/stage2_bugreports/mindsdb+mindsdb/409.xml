	<summary>Underlying backend version changes can break saved model compatibility</summary>
	<description>
If we save a model with a certain mindsdb version, that can accept a variable version for lightwood and ludwig, thus, if the user updated mindsdb or the underlying backend, even if the version of mindsdb stays the same, the change in the backend version cab mean that the models saved under this mindsdb version can break.
The easiest fix is to have both lightwood and ludwig have an exact version under mindsdb, but that might create other issues, especially for us internally where we might want to test with a different lightwood/ludwig version.
The harder fix is to include the backend version in the save path of the model and refuse to load model from a backend with a different version. Ideally explaining to the user in the error message that the backend versions differ and a new model has to be trained with the new version.
I'm not sure if it's worth doing anything about it right now, but worth jolting this down so we can address it in the future when we have more time.

		Did I mentioned that this is still an issue and a core problem of the way we do releases right now.

 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ricram2&gt;@Ricram2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I think we need a specific product design meeting, potentially one to which we should assign 1-2 hours, to lay out and decide upon every possible solution to handle this.
