	<summary>Predict fails when the probabilistic validator runs when predicting multiple outputs</summary>
	<description>
Title pretty much says it all, predict fails during the call to the probabilistic validator when predicting more than 1 target variable.
Haven't tried replicating on more dataset, but even if it only happens occasionally it's pretty bad.
This was working before, so it must have been a bug introduced in the last 1 or 2 months.

		Closing this for now, as I might have miss-diagnosed the issue.
