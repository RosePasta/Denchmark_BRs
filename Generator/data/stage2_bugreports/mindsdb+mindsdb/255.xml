		What is the command you used to install ? Was it: sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/master/distributions/docker/build-docker.sh)" ?

		I'm asking because there's also an image on DockerHub which I think is outdated.

		Hmh, nevermind, I was able to replicate locally using the docker image on github. I'll try figuring out why it's happening and get back to you when it's fixed.
In the meanwhile I encourage you to try installing mindsdb via pip or cloning the github repo and using or installing it that way.
Thanks for pointing out this issue.

		Yes, I did use sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/master/distributions/docker/build-docker.sh)"
Initially, I tried to install through pip (virtualenv) but it failed.
During install, I saw the following error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: tensorflow 1.13.1 has requirement tensorflow-estimator&lt;1.14.0rc0,&gt;=1.13.0, but you'll have tensorflow-estimator 1.14.0 which is incompatible.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But not sure if the install is successful or not.
When I tried to run an example with the following errors
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR:mindsdb-logger-42382738-9d8e-11e9-86bf-702084096a19:libs/controllers/transaction.py:105 - 'Could not load module ModelInterface'

		The latest install fix doesn't seem to fix this issue, partially because of OS detection not working as expected on docker. I'm working on a fix for this and will keep you posted. For now, install via pip should once again work as of the latest version on any environemnt and operating system.

		Docker install now dails with a different error:
ERROR: Cannot remove entries from nonexistent file /opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/easy-install.pth
Something specific to the way pip / python gets installed

		Ok, I think we should replace this FROM pytorch/pytorch:0.4.1-cuda9-cudnn7-runtime in the docker file with some basic python 3.7 env from which to start our container.

		With the merging of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/pull/284&gt;#284&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this should now be fixed.
