	<summary>Predicting launches the mysql api subprocess AGAIN</summary>
	<description>
At the moment running a predict query launches the MYSQL api process... again :/
not sure why this is happening, doesn't result in an error, it just fails, but obviously wastes a shit load of ressources and delays everything by doing it.

 any ideas as to why this happens and possible fixes are welcome, getting this fixed is kind of urgent obviously.

		How can i reproduce it?
I run mindsdb with http and mysql api. See three processes. Run 'select * from predictor where sqft=1000' and there just one thread appears for this query, no new processes.

		I think this was fixed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/StpMax&gt;@StpMax&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I don't remember how or why exactly, but the whole multiprocessing bit I've quite revamped since then anyway, so doesn't matter.
