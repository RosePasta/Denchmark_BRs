		Should be fixed &amp;&amp; more importantly should have been caught by testing.
I thought this error was fixed, so it's weird that it's popping up again, especially since predict should be done in the same process presently, not in a sparate one.
Especially since this is a datasource error...
What dataset are you suing here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZoranPandovski&gt;@ZoranPandovski&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and how are you making the  call ?

		Any tips on working around this? I got the error, then on my second attempt at creating the training it worked. However, now I get the error every time and training simply wont start. Should I downgrade?
I am using Scout.

 We are releasing a new version tomorrow so this will be fixed, currently the fix is on staging branch.
