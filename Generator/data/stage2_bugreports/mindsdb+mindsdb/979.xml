	<summary>relative path in pickle files of prediction meta</summary>
	<description>
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
If we dump all folders of prediction in another server for importing via copying folders. Metadata has an absolute path for prediction. it will cause the file missing.
Having a relative path may solve the problem of migrating all of the prediction folders to another system and their time.
Describe the solution you'd like
if we could change save_path in the pickle file relative, and change the prediction path with server path.
example:
{'save_path': 'lightwood_data'}
