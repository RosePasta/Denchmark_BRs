This is what I am doing a simple ner training on custom data
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;with configs.ner.ner_ontonotes_bert_mult.open(encoding='utf8') as f:
    ner_config = json.load(f)

ner_config['dataset_reader']['data_path'] = '/Users/sm/deeppavlov'  
ner_config['metadata']['variables']['NER_PATH'] = '/Users/sm/deeppavlov'
ner_config['metadata']['download'] = [ner_config['metadata']['download'][-1]]  

ner_model = train_model(ner_config, download=True)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
