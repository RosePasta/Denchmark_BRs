	<summary>method download_decompress downloads non-existing files</summary>
	<description>
I've used method download_decompress to load the file from remote storage. It seems that if I provide &lt;denchmark-link:http://files.deeppavlov.ai/spelling_crrectors/elmo_weights_ckpt3.tar.gz&gt;broken URL&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the method downloads content without check of file validity and tries to unpack it (although it is not archieve) and silently continues on fail.
I think expected behavior is to raise exception for missed file on broken URL and wrong archive formats.

		We need to check a status code in simple_download(). It's weird that we do not do that already.
