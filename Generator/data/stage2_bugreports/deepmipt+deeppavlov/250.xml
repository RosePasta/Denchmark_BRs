	<summary>Database connection failing with Telegram API</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When using pre-trained gobot_dstc2_best.json with interactbot, I receive the following error:

sqlite3.ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread. The object was created in thread id 4321387392 and this is thread id 123145327210496

However, it does work using interact. Would you know what is the problem with the Telegram API?
Thanks!
