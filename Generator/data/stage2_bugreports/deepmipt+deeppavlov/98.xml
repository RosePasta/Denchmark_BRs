	<summary>Files not found while running telegram bot</summary>
	<description>
I run telegram bot interface (copy-paste from readme)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python -m deeppavlov.deep interactbot deeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json -t TELEGRAM_TOKEN
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But the error is given:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/home/ubuntu/work/ipavlov/DeepPavlov/deeppavlov/core/common/file.py", line 22, in read_json
    with open(fpath) as fin:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../telegram_utils/models_info.json' 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

All files have been downloaded and successfully used in training.

		It's a bug. We will fix it soon. Workaround: try to cd deeppavlov (there is a folder inside root directory) and run from this directory (not from the root directory of the project).
