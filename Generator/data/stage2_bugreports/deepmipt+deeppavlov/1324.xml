DeepPavlov version (you can look it up by running pip show deeppavlov):
Python version: 3.7.6
Operating system (ubuntu linux, windows, ...): ubuntu linux
Issue:
The requirments.txt should be written for compatible with multiple versions of packages.
For instance,  condition numpy&gt;=1.18.0 is preferred by software developers instead of strictly declaring numpy==1.18.0.
At first, developers like me feel very inconvenient.

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/duongkstn&gt;@duongkstn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We prefer  in requirements to  because of possible errors when a new version of dependencies is released. What errors can be caused by using double equals?
