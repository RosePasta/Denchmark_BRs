	<summary>Unexpected loss shown during `deep.py train`</summary>
	<description>
python deep.py train config.json
first trains model, then loads it from disk and calculates valid and test scores.
In case when load_path and save_path differ, final test score will be calculated for model from load_path, which creates quite a confusion.

		In current version before evaluating the model, its save_path block in config is written over its load_path. But model in go_bot configs itself does not have save and load path, they are in its children, so config parser does not know, what to do.
We can try and do the paths thing deeper in the model's config tree, but i'm not sure that it's the right way.
