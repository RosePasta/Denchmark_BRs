	<summary>[BUG] Regarding relative_pose</summary>
	<description>
Either this math is wrong or I misunderstood some of the notation here.
P_1^{2} = \begin{bmatrix} R_2 R_1^T &amp; R_1^T (t_2 - t_1) \ \mathbf{0} &amp;
1\end{bmatrix}
I believe the correct forms should be (assuming when you say pose, it is wrt to some common frame, thus T_1 is actually T_1^W, T_2 is actually T_2^W. Then the relative transformation from 1 to 2 is T_2^1 which is
T_2^1 = T_1 ^ -1 * T_2 = R_1^T * R_2 | R_1^T * (t_2 - t_1)
So the rotation is flipped.
or
T_1^2 = T_2 ^ -1 * T_1 = R_2^T * R_1 | R_2^T * (t_1 - t_2)

		My code broke down due to this bug too... I manually calculate relative pose then my code works.
