	<summary>[BUG] crop_and_resize doesn't work when it changes image aspect ratio</summary>
	<description>
Here is a failing test-case, adapted from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/arraiyopensource/kornia/blob/a48164b1274827773f3da36dcbe2879c69f4471c/test/geometry/transform/test_crop.py#L14&gt;this test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but with some aspect-ratio distortion:
&gt;&gt;&gt; inp = torch.tensor([[
            [1., 2., 3., 4.],
            [5., 6., 7., 8.],
            [9., 10., 11., 12.],
            [13., 14., 15., 16.],
        ]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; height, width = 2, 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; boxes = torch.tensor([[
            [1., 1.],
            [1., 2.],
            [2., 1.],
            [2., 2.],
        ]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; kornia.crop_and_resize(inp, boxes, (height, width))
tensor([[[ 6.0000,  7.0000,  8.0000],
         [ 8.0000,  9.0000, 10.0000]]])
But the expected result, as per &lt;denchmark-link:https://torchgeometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geometry.transform.html#kornia.geometry.transform.crop_and_resize&gt;documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, is:
torch.tensor([[[6., 6.5, 7.],
               [10., 10.5, 11.]]])
The issue seems to be caused by a mis-use of the  function by . The arguments to &lt;denchmark-link:https://torchgeometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geometry.transform.html#kornia.geometry.transform.get_perspective_transform&gt;get_perspective_transform&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 expect points to be written in [x,y] format (not documented), but  passes them in [y,x]. The [x,y] ordering in  is &lt;denchmark-link:https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/warp_perspective.html&gt;used in this example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The existing tests for crop_and_resize are written in such an unfortunate way that they work both ways.

		The question is how to correct this:

Change crop_and_resize to take [x,y]
Change get_perspective_transform to take [y,x]
Leave the interfaces as-is, and convert between the representations inside crop_and_resize

Edit: there's also an issue with point ordering: clockwise (get_perspective_transform), or left-to-right, top-to-bottom (`crop_and_resize')

		I will submit a PR if we decide which approach to take.

 good catch ! I would go for 1 just make thing simple. If you can also update the test to cover this corners cases would be great.
