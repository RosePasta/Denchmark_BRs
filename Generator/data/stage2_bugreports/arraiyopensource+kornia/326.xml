	<summary>mode parameter is not used in warp_affine (and homography)</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Thanks for the great library!
I've been trying to use the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kornia/kornia/blob/cdd8f01f5ff6e1c7ac68b47137f0f77bd671ba4d/kornia/geometry/transform/imgwarp.py#L111&gt;warp_affine&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 function using the  interpolation (as opposed to the default  interpolation). However, in the function definition it looks like the  parameter is not used.  depends on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kornia/kornia/blob/cdd8f01f5ff6e1c7ac68b47137f0f77bd671ba4d/kornia/geometry/transform/imgwarp.py#L57&gt;transform_warp_impl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which doesn't have the  or  keyword for interpolation.  in turn depends on  which does have the  keyword for interpolation. Finally, it seems like, the  keyword is passed to  and this is where the interpolation actually happens. But it seems like the interpolation mode is "lost" when going from  to the eventual .
Is there any plan to fix this? It can be quite confusing when reading the docs, since warp_affine's behaviour does not change when changing the interpolation mode. Thank you!

		Hi,
Thank you for the point out. We plan to fix it, but now quite busy because of CVPR deadline. Feel free to submit fixing PR in meantime ;)
