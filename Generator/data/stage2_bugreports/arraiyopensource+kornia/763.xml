	<summary>[BUG] Deprecated interpolation argument doesn't have an effect</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;🐛 Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Deprecated interpolation argument doesn't have an effect since self.resample gets overwritten right after it gets set by interpolation



kornia/kornia/augmentation/augmentation.py


        Lines 612 to 616
      in
      c77e62c






 if interpolation is not None: 



 import warnings 



 warnings.warn("interpolation is deprecated. Please use resample instead.", category=DeprecationWarning) 



 self.resample = Resample.get(interpolation) 



 self.resample = Resample.get(resample)
