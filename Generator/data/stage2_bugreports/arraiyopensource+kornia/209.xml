	<summary>kornia.angle_axis_to_rotation_matrix does not seem working</summary>
	<description>
Hi there,
I did a pip install from source and found that
konia.angle_axis_to_rotation_matrix and konia.rotation_matrix_to_angle_axis are not consistent.
I did the following:
input = torch.rand(1, 3)
output = kornia.angle_axis_to_rotation_matrix(input)
input_back = kornia.rotation_matrix_to_angle_axis(output)
input and input_back will not be the same.
Also I tried quaternion, which seems working fine.
input = torch.rand(1, 3)
output = kornia.angle_axis_to_quaternion(input)
input_back = kornia.quaternion_to_angle_axis(output)
rotation_matrix_output = kornia.quaternion_to_rotation_matrix(output)
output_back = kornia.rotation_matrix_to_quaternion(rotation_matrix_output)
input_matrix_to_angle_axis = kornia.rotation_matrix_to_angle_axis(rotation_matrix_output)
input, input_back and input_matrix_to_angle_axis are the same, output and output_back are the same as well.
So it seems that kornia.rotation_matrix_to_angle_axis is correct, while kornia.angle_axis_to_rotation_matrix is not.

		Further inverstigation seems that kornia.angle_axis_to_rotation_matrix is correct, while kornia.rotation_matrix_to_angle_axis is wrong.

 pip version of kornia is outdated. Have you tried with master ? We plan a release within the next couple of weeks with a lot of fixes since last version. Let us know, otherwise we can investigate whether there's a bug in that function.

		I actually tried the pip install from source using command
pip install git+&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/arraiyopensource/kornia&gt;https://github.com/arraiyopensource/kornia&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is this version up to date ?

 installing directly with pip+git gives you the version in master. Have you found any workaround for this issue ? an alternative could be comparing against tf.graphics that implements same features &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/graphics/blob/master/tensorflow_graphics/geometry/transformation/axis_angle.py#L147&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/graphics/blob/master/tensorflow_graphics/geometry/transformation/axis_angle.py#L147&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
