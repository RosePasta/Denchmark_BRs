	<summary>[BUG] Raise Exception when Int Tensor</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to use ColorJitter augmentation and mistakenly passing torch.uint8 Tensor as input. This didn't raise any warning/error but instead crashed the session abruptly. I realized the cause after 2-3 attempts. So assuming that majority of augmentations work on Float types, it would be great to introduce a type-check at the beginning of forward pass to avoid unnecessary crashes.

 thanks for reporting this bug. We should start normalizing type checks to avoid this problems. I add this as a TODO for next releases. Any contribution is welcomed.

		Sorry but I wasn't working on this. Also, I just skimmed through the commit that was referring to this issue and thought it'll be fixed by that. So I'm not sure about the progress.

		Yes. I have added a type check. _validate_input_dtype(input, accepted_dtypes=[torch.float16, torch.float32, torch.float64]). Only float numbers are accepted now.
