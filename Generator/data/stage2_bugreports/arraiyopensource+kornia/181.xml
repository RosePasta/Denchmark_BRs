	<summary>[BUG] Bug in _compute_projection ?</summary>
	<description>
It seems to me that there is a bug in the DepthWarper class (in the _compute_projection) function.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/arraiyopensource/kornia/blob/master/kornia/geometry/warp/depth_warper.py#L96&gt;https://github.com/arraiyopensource/kornia/blob/master/kornia/geometry/warp/depth_warper.py#L96&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

z is to be actually computed as 1. / flow[:, 3] as opposed to 1. / flow[:,2]. (Recall that flow is computed from point, which is ordered on Line 93 of the same script as torch.FloatTensor([[[x], [y], [1.0], [invd]]]). This indicates that the inverse depth will lie at index flow[:,3], not flow[:,2].

 the DepthWarper class has to be refactored very soon. I'll work on that.

 we recentyl introduced  which I believe that can be replaced by compute_projection. Actually, thinking to drop it out from the API.

		Yes, that sounds about right.
