	<summary>Tensorboard resets step counter if the training restarted with runner.train(resume=last_full.pth)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug Report&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using SupervisedRunner.
If you restart training by loading the full checkpoint last_full.pth and runner.train(..., resume=last_full.pth), then tensorboard will restart the iteration ciunter to zero, which will correupt the plot.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Screenshots&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Tensorboards continues to log from the latest iterationa and not from 0-th.

		Hi,
Thanks for your issue contribution. Based on Catalyst design, every  is a new experiment run.
If you would like to run a multi-stage experiment and transfer the model from one stage to another, you could try our &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/tree/master/examples/cifar_stages&gt;Config API example here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, or... &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Scitator/kittylyst/blob/master/demo.ipynb&gt;try out Kittlylyst example here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, looks like we need to setup Catalyst-one too
