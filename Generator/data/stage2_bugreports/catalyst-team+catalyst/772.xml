	<summary>"not_basic" check in VerboseLogger has a spelling mistake?</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
This checks for the _timers prefix:



catalyst/catalyst/core/callbacks/logging.py


         Line 47
      in
      fbd7d0e






 not_basic = not (key.startswith("_base") or key.startswith("_timers")) 





However the default timer callback has a _timer prefix, not _timers, and there's nowhere else where the _timers string is mentioned. Effectively, this always shows all timer metrics in VerboseLogger, rather than just _timer/_fps as seems intended judging by the default value of the always_show argument.

 good catch!
This looks like so, thank you!
Is it possible for you to create a small PR with typo fix?
