	<summary>Bug in MulticlassIOUMetricCallback &amp; MulticlassDiceMetricCallback</summary>
	<description>
Ciao guys,
I am receiving  error in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/b80857391ff1ac752e5a498fe761d2d377b63146/catalyst/dl/callbacks/metrics/iou.py#L126&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, probably because  function  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/b80857391ff1ac752e5a498fe761d2d377b63146/catalyst/dl/callbacks/metrics/iou.py#L58&gt;returns&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 numpy.ndarray.
One of possible solutions, maybe, is to refactor calculate_jaccard function in order to return dictionary of class_ids and iou values.
