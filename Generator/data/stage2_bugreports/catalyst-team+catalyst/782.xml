&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug Report&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi, I used WandbLogger and faced this problem
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37884009/80644617-9a6d9880-8a72-11ea-9833-a9ff345449aa.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Also I noticed that splitted_epoch_metrics has structure like:
{"train": {"loss": 1, "loss_qa":0.5, "loss_clf": 0.5, "metric": 1}, "valid": {"loss": 1,"loss_qa":0.5, "loss_clf": 0.5, "metric": 1}}
What is propose of  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/f58ffac876f514f3b52537d62b5c81b562a93fa9/catalyst/contrib/dl/callbacks/wandb.py#L172&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? Maybe in this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/f58ffac876f514f3b52537d62b5c81b562a93fa9/catalyst/contrib/dl/callbacks/wandb.py#L181&gt;line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we should pass  instead of  to  method. If I do so error disappears and all works well.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
I am running my script with  and getting this error on epoch end. With &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/PUSSYMIPT/db95014542442f2e03cd1fddf7610b88&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 config. Model is a multitask roberta with two heads, so I have three losses (main_loss=loss1+loss2, loss1, loss2) and one metric.
So in  I have something like, in  variable i get , this is enough to reproduce key error. Anyway I don't think that error somehow depends on my code and will also reproduces with any experiment which doesn't have a loader which name starts with . Am I missing something?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
