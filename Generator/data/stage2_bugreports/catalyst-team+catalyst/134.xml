		I suggest adding a check in a form of a test, and not as separate dirty hack. Other tests for loggers would be great as well)

		It can't be done through ConsoleLogger because it can only append text to a file or a stream.
In the case of JSON, we should not only append some texts but also support the format.
Probably we may fix this with some kind of JsonLogger class with different logic, but I, personally,  don't think we really need this feature
