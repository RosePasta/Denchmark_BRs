		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yartem&gt;@yartem&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for pointing this out, nice catch!
Would you like to make a small PR hotfix as issue author (it seems like you already found the solution ;) )
I think, something like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if self.tqdm is not None:
  self.tqdm.write("Early exiting")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

should close the issue. What do you think?
