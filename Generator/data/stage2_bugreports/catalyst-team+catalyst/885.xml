&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug Report&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

pooling and bert_output objects in process_bert_output function can be on different devices.
Something like this will solve the issue.
pooling = (
    LamaPooling(groups=pooling_groups, in_features=hidden_size)
    if pooling_groups is not None
    else None
)

if pooling is not None:
    pooling = pooling.to(bert_output[0].device)

...
However, this is not the best way to do it :)
