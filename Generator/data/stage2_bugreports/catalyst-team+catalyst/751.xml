I pretty much followed the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/examples/notebooks/classification-tutorial.ipynb&gt;classification tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and changed the dataset to my own dataset and I receive an  error of similar nature to a very old issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/issues/472&gt;#472 &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: Caught TypeError in DataLoader worker process 0.

I have cloned notebook which should download my dataset &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/101lnX-MHKaDsH7_qDC0s8p_cHVq0ZLiq&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and should replicate the issue.
Expected behavior
It should start outputting the Epoch's Accuracies etc just like example Artist dataset should.

		Hi,
Could you please check if everything will be fine with imageio&lt;2.5.0?

 Problem still persists with imageio==2.2.0 and imageio==2.3.0 (just tried in my colab notebook that I linked)

		could you please check, if an error still occurs with only jpg/png dataset?

		This error disappears if you replace multiple pip installs in the second cell with a single one: !pip install -U albumentations pretrainedmodels catalyst tensorflow

 I've checked all the images using ImageMagick by converting everything to JPG if they weren't already JPG
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/YaLTeR&gt;@YaLTeR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Unfortunately I still get the error in the notebook with that particular change

 I am also getting the same error '_open() got an unexpected keyword argument 'as_gray'. Any temporary fix for now?

 I found out that this error occurs when our image is in  format. Even if the extension of the file is  the file format is different sometimes while reading the files.
The temporary fix for this issue is Instead of calling  in  while creating and initializing  and we can use  which handles all types of files

 yup,  is mostly focused on typical image formats, like ,  etc.
For ,  - you can try to use  instead :)
Nevertheless, PR with appropriate docs (that you find clear to use and read) would be really welcome, thanks in advance!
