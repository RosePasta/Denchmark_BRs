	<summary>When using an activation function of "Softmax2d" for many callbacks and losses, no argmax is applied</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;(I will compile a list and hopefully open a PR if needed)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Describe the bug
This behavior is present in a plethora of catalyst's callbacks and losses. It's consistent, but it's definitely confusing for many new users.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Use these functions/classes:
Callbacks

MeterMetricsCallback

I'm not sure if this can support meters with softmax? Need to double check



Criterion // Dependents

dice

DiceCallback
DiceLoss


f1_score

F1ScoreCallback


iou

IoULoss
IouCallback



Expected behavior
Should ideally apply argmax when activation='Softmax2d'
Screenshots

 Ahhhh sorry, I've been prioritizing work lately. I'll hopefully get to this by the end of next week. I think the PR should just be a warning for the next version and then the actual changes on the version after that.
