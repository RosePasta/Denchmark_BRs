<bug id='764' author='YaLTeR' open_date='2020-04-22T07:23:09Z' closed_time='2020-12-25T23:42:38Z'>
	<summary>Resuming training repeats the last epoch</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When resuming the training from a checkpoint, the last epoch is repeated. So for example if the checkpoint was after 4 epochs of training, after resuming the epoch will be 4 again instead of 5.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Train the model with the default CheckpointCallback.
Try to resume training from any checkpoint with the default CheckpointCallback.

Colab notebook based on the MNIST tutorial: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hf1q0vrgc4Sh5tCnZR4WFsDkZJIzO9-e&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hf1q0vrgc4Sh5tCnZR4WFsDkZJIzO9-e&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
from catalyst.dl import SupervisedRunner

logdir = "./logdir"

num_samples, num_features = int(1e4), int(1e1)
X, y = torch.rand(num_samples, num_features), torch.rand(num_samples)
dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)
loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, num_workers=1)
loaders = {"train": loader, "valid": loader}

model = torch.nn.Linear(num_features, 1)
criterion = torch.nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR(optimizer, [3, 6])

runner = SupervisedRunner()
runner.train(
    model=model,
    criterion=criterion,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    scheduler=scheduler,
    loaders=loaders,
    logdir=logdir,
    num_epochs=4  # Train for 4 epochs
)

# Let's train for 4 more epochs
# Issue: the training starts at epoch = 4 instead of epoch = 5,
# so the 4th epoch is repeated
runner.train(
    model=model,
    criterion=criterion,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    scheduler=scheduler,
    loaders=loaders,
    logdir=logdir,
    num_epochs=8,
    verbose=True,
    resume='logdir/checkpoints/last_full.pth'
)
Expected behavior
The next epoch is selected. So if a checkpoint is after n epochs of training the n+1th epoch is selected.

Note the vertical step on the 4th epoch because it was repeated.

		long story short, easy solution would be to add
        if self.resume is not None:
            self._load_runner(runner, mapping=self.resume, load_full=True)
            # to continue training
            runner.epoch += 1
            runner.global_epoch += 1
            self.resume = None

		from my perspective - it's super helpful, because it tracks this issue :)
could you please check current master version?
we have a fix recently &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples&gt;https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst#minimal-examples&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

pip install git+https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst@master --upgrade

		Same issue in my example notebook when replacing catalyst with the git version.

		Is this issue still open? If it is not fixed, then I can use it as a first timer task.

 hi, thank you for your proposal
I think this is open still :) but maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/YaLTeR&gt;@YaLTeR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could help a bit more
Also it would be great if you could join our slack to discuss this issue there - &lt;denchmark-link:https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw&gt;https://join.slack.com/t/catalyst-team-core/shared_invite/zt-d9miirnn-z86oKDzFMKlMG4fgFdZafw&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
