	<summary>AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'items' when using `MulticlassDiceMetricCallback`</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
In the on_loader_end method for MulticlassDiceMetricCallback, batch_metrics is a numpy array instead of a dict. This is because batch_metrics = calculate_dice(...) and calculate_dice returns a np.ndarray of the dice coefficients for each class instead of a dict.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Train a segmentation pipeline with MulticlassDiceMetricCallback.
Haven't explored edge cases where this bug may not be an issue.

Expected behavior
Should work properly and return the multi-class dice scores for each class.
