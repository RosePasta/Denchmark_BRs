Describe the bug
I was trying to resume my training of a model. The resume_path is a string "./saved_model/best.pth".
I run into this error:
168             checkpoint_callback_flag = any([
169                 isinstance(x, CheckpointCallback)
--&gt; 170                 for x in callbacks.values()
171             ])
172             if not checkpoint_callback_flag:
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'values'
The error seems not related to the checkpoint but to the callbacks. For the callbacks argument, here is what I passed in callbacks=[DiceCallback(), EarlyStoppingCallback(patience=5, min_delta=-0.1)],
I think I was using the runner.train() fucntion in a incorrect way because catalyst is very good other than this.
Has anyone have similar experience?

		I had the same issue.
Modify line 167 to callbacks = process_callback(callbacks)
after importing from catalyst.dl.utils import callbacks
After making this change , it works as expected. The code didnot consider the case when callbacks is a list and not a dictionary. Adding that line corrects it.
