	<summary>AMP wants the model to be first sent to CUDA device</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When training with fp16, AMP says that we need to provide a model with parameters located on CUDA.

The problem is reproduced in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/distillbert-catalyst-amazon-product-reviews?scriptVersionId=22987225&gt;this Kernel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (Version 3).
Expected behavior
Expect the model to train normally
Screenshots
Calling runner.train

Getting error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;When using amp.initialize, you need to provide a model with parameters
located on a CUDA device before passing it no matter what optimization level
you chose. Use model.to('cuda') to use the default device.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Additional context
The problem is solved if I pass model=model.cuda() to runner.train. But I don't think it's designed to be done like that.
Catalyst version is 19.11.

		The issue happened when using Kaggle. Strange. This is not reproduced on my machine. Trains fine.

		I had same issue when I use Catalyst 19.11. on google colab. When I change the version to 19.10, the error didn't show up.

		Looks like it's fine now, same &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/distillbert-catalyst-amazon-product-reviews&gt;Kernel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, 11th version. Closing.
