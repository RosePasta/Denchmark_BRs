	<summary>Pycharm debugger problems with logdir==''</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
If I'll set logdir='' in runner.train method, folder code will be created.
That folder will become source of an unexpected behavior on next code runs of this script in PyCharm debugger.
During PyCharm debugger start following code will be evaluated:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;try:
    from code import InteractiveConsole
except ImportError:
    from _pydevd_bundle.pydevconsole_code_for_ironpython import InteractiveConsole
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And will end up with error
ImportError: cannot import name 'InteractiveConsole'
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'exec'
Because there are folder /code is present in the same location as script, it can be interpreted not as pycharm code.py, but as independent module if there are __init__.py in it (it is possible, because all folder with script will be copied to folder /code).
I think this is a very unusual behavior, it took me some time to point the problem, so at least some warnings will be perfect.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create script main.py with runner evaluation
Create __init__.py file in the same folder
Set logdir=''
Run script main.py
Rerun script with PyCharm debugger

Expected behavior
There are several ways to avoid that possible problem

Change folder name from /code to something else
Do not copy __init__.py file into /code folder
Show a warning that logdir='' might cause some problems

		Do you have any troubles with logdir="./path/to/logdir" variant?
