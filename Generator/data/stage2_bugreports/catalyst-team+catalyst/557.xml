	<summary>Incorrect Tensorboard import</summary>
	<description>

in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/utils/tensorboard.py&gt;https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/catalyst/utils/tensorboard.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

from torch import __version__ as torch_version  # noqa: E402
from packaging import version  # noqa: E402
if version.parse(torch_version) &lt; version.parse("1.2.0"):
    from tensorboardX import SummaryWriter as tensorboardX_SummaryWriter
    SummaryWriter = tensorboardX_SummaryWriter
else:
    from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter as torch_SummaryWriter
    SummaryWriter = torch_SummaryWriter
if version.parse(torch_version) &lt; version.parse("1.2.0"):
    from tensorboardX.proto.event_pb2 import Event
else:
    from tensorboard.compat.proto.event_pb2 import Event
There is incorrect SummaryWriter and Event imports while having tensorboard &lt; 1.14.0
To Reproduce

torch==1.3.1
tensorboard==1.12.2
from catalyst.dl import utils

Expected behavior
from tensorboardX import SummaryWriter and from tensorboardX.proto.event_pb2 import Event are called

		Hello! Thank you for the report. I don't think that this issue can be considered as a bug, because there is latest version of tensorboard in requirements.txt.

		Hi! Yes, I totally agree, but if you first install tensorboard of the old version and then catalyst, you will have the wrong version of tensorboard
Plus, i believe, that this can be easily fixed by additional version checking in if-statement

		I guess it can be fixed with requirements rewrite. Just need to change the requirements to tensorboard&gt;=1.14.0, instead of plain tensorboard.
No need for checking old versions, there will be more pain of legacy support. Even this import decision was not easy, and has been made this way because most users are still on PyTorch version &gt;=1.2.0.
That's all just in my opinion. Feel free to make PR, Catalyst devs will be glad to review it and merge in case of success. Just don't forget to check codestyle :)

 thanks for reporting the bug and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Arquestro&gt;@Arquestro&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for a quick and reasonable solution 

I guess it can be fixed with requirements rewrite. Just need to change the requirements to tensorboard&gt;=1.14.0

Could you please provide a PR with this? ðŸ™‚

		Thanks for respond!
I agree, it's better to fix tensorboard version
But still, I believe, that there are some people who use catalyst and tensorflow with version &lt;1.14.0 in their projects, and it's seems that compatibility issue can be solved with different import
Or it will be bad in terms of legacy support?

		Hi, for now let's hotfix with version requirements. Nevertheless, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Podidiving&gt;@Podidiving&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if you would like to contribute better support for older versions â€“ it would be great.
