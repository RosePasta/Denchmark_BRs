	<summary>Bug with default input and output keys</summary>
	<description>
As far as I understood, criterion module is wrapping now with CriterionCallback.
But the problem is that in CriterionCallback there is a default output_key='logits', and if I have no 'logits' in my outputs of neural net, I receive an error KeyError: 'logits'.
To reproduce it you just need to set output_key to something that does not contain 'logits'.
Also the same thing we have for 'features' key for inputs.

		Hmm, somehow input_target_key arguments fixed this problem ðŸ¤”
