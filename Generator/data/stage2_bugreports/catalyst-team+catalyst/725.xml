	<summary>dice metric</summary>

catalyst/utils/metrics/dice.py
dice = 2 * (intersection + eps * (union == 0)) / (union + eps)
It seems like if union = 0 and intersection = 0, we get  dice = 2 * (0 + eps) / (0 + eps) = 2 ?
Should be
dice = (2 * intersection + eps * (union == 0)) / (union + eps)
or I don't understand something?)

		I agree on this :) That one boundary point is essential in case you have empty target mask.

, ok, I'd like to make PR to handle this issue.
One more question.
For what reason we use eps?)
What if we use something like this:
dice = (2 * intersection + (union == 0)) / (union + (union == 0)) ?
