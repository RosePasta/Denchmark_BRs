	<summary>the seg_rgbs.txt seems to be out of date</summary>
	<description>
I get object id by name  manually ,then I get rgb by id from seg_rgbs.txt as  the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/image_apis.md#startup-object-ids&gt;doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 here says.
but the color doesn't seems to be same as the sub window 2 shows  .
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def getIdbyName(names):
    names = names.lower()
    hashId = 0
    for chara in names:
        asciiCode = ord(chara)
        if asciiCode&gt;=97  :
            hashId += asciiCode
    
    hashId %= 256 
    return hashId

def getCollorById(hashId):
    return rgbList[hashId]# from seg_rgbs.txt

collorRGB = getCollorById(getIdbyName("Truck"))
print collorRGB
img = Image.new('RGB', (500,500), tuple(collorRGB))
img.show()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
