	<summary>Reset doesn't work after simSetPose</summary>
	<description>
I followed this issue
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/issues/553&gt;#553&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But the difference is that in the above issue they execute the moveToPosition command, but I want to use the simSetPose command on the python client.

		I may have a realization, but I will keep this issue open because I don't know if my hypothesis is true.
Is it that there are certain commands that are meant for computer vision mode and others for regular mode?

		I think I have found the issue. The reset() API currently doesn't work in CV mode. To fix this there is bunch of refactoring needed. I would suggest to just use simSetPose API to set position to 0,0,0 for now.
client.simSetPose(Pose(Vector3r(0, 0, 0), AirSimClientBase.toQuaternion(0, 0, 0)), True)
