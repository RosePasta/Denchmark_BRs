	<summary>Compilation Error: build.cmd fails to build when path too long [bug] [fix proposed]</summary>
	<description>
I was cloning Airsim where the path was about 100 characters long and when executing build.cmd  it was always failing with errors such as:
airsim\airlib\include\common\vectormath.hpp(12): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'Eigen/Dense': No such file or directory
What I did is that in a x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017, I ran the following command located at line 127 of the script:
move AirLib\deps\eigen* AirLib\deps\del_eigen
The result returned is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The filename or extension is too long.
        0 dir(s) moved.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What I did is that I cloned the repot to C:/Tmp/Airsim/ and the script was executed successfully.
What I propose would be to change the line:
move AirLib\deps\eigen* AirLib\deps\del_eigen
to the powershell move
Move-Item -Path AirLib\deps\eigen*  -Destination AirLib\deps\del_eigen
The powershell move worked, it seems to be more flexible about the length of the path.
Obviously, there are probably more lines that are not executed correctly when the path is too long, they will have to be fixed as well.
