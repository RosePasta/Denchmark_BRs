	<summary>It seems that simGetCollisionInfo () sometimes doesn't work</summary>
	<description>
Hi.I recently used reinforcement learning to train UAVs to avoid obstacles, but what bothered me was that the simgetcollisioninfo() function didn't always return "true" when UAVs collided in a virtual environment. For example, it will get into the grass and cannot move, and simgetcollisioninfo() will not remind me.
Here is my codeï¼š
&lt;def step(self,action,step_count):
self.client.simPause(False)
temp = airsim.YawMode()
temp.is_rate = False
self.client.moveByVelocityAsync(action[0], action[1], action[2], 3 ,airsim.DrivetrainType.ForwardOnly,temp)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;            start_time = time.time()
            while time.time() - start_time &lt;= 3:
	#pos = state_[1][2]
            #pos_ = v2t(self.client.simGetGroundTruthKinematics().position)                        
                    info = None
                    done = False
                    
                    pos = v2t(self.client.simGetGroundTruthKinematics().position)
                    if self.isDone(pos):
                            done = True
                            reward = 50
                            info = "success"
		
                    elif self.client.simGetCollisionInfo().has_collided:
                            reward = -50
                            done = True
                            info = "collision"
                    elif pos[2] &lt; self.height_limit:
                            done = True
                            info = "too high"
                            reward = -50
                    elif pos[2]&gt;=-1:
                            reward = -50
                            done = True
                            info = "landed"
                    elif step_count&gt;=200:
                            reward = -50
                            done = True
                            info = "freeze"
                    else:
                            self.i=True
            self.client.simPause(True)&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Hi, can you please share the collision settings for the ground in this level?
In particular check whether it's set to "Collision Enabled", "GenerateOverlapEvents=true", and that it's set to collide with all collision channels.
The collision settings can be found in the details panel of the actor.
