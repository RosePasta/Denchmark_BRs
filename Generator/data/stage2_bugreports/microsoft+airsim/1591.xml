	<summary>Question about 2D Lidar: Channel missing</summary>
	<description>
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
AirSim 1.2
I am currently adding a Lidar sensor to my vehicle. I need a 2D Lidar, but when I change the number of channels to 1 in the settings.json file, the sensor won't show any points. Only when the number of channels are 2 or more it works.
The position with respect to the vehicle seems fine to me. As I said, it works perfectly for 2 or more channels, being the points shown where I want.
This is my current configuration for the Lidar:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  "Lidar1": {
     "SensorType": 6,
     "Enabled" : true,
     "NumberOfChannels": 1,
     "RotationsPerSecond": 10,
     "PointsPerSecond": 10000,
     "X": 0, "Y": 0, "Z": -0.15,
     "Roll": 0, "Pitch": 0, "Yaw" : 0,
     "VerticalFOVUpper": 0,
     "VerticalFOVLower": 0,
     "HorizontalFOVStart": 0,
     "HorizontalFOVEnd": 0,
     "DrawDebugPoints": true
   }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Am I maybe missing something? Thanks!
