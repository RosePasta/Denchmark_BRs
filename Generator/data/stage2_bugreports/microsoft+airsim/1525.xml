I finally successfully install the cntk on Ubuntu18.04, and hello_car.py also runs well, while met new issue of MemoryError when call the DQNcar.py, error shown as
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/home/jet/anaconda3/envs/py2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cntk/cntk_py_init.py:47: UserWarning: Unsupported Linux distribution (ubuntu-18.04). CNTK supports Ubuntu 16.04 and above, only.

  File "DQNcar.py", line 35, in __init__
    self._states = np.zeros((size,) + sample_shape, dtype=np.float32)
MemoryError

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Anybody got a idea?

?

		Well how big do you choose your replay buffer to be? I mean I can't fit 1 million  samples in there as they did in the paper.

		I can't say that either :-)
Seems to be trial and error (if this is causing the error)

		Hi, thank you for reporting this issue.  This script was recently removed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3215&gt;#3215&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and replaced with a new script at \AirSim\PythonClient\reinforcement_learning\dqn_car.py that uses the new OpenAI gym wrapper. I tested the new script locally and it runs for me. Can you retest with the new script and report back if you see any issues?
