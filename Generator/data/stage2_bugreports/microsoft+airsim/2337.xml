	<summary>Settings.json not changing SimMode in Unity</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to set the SimMode in the settings.json file in Unity. When I run in Unity, there are no errors but no matter what I set SimMode to, it always starts at the selection mode. I have checked that deleting the file produces errors, so it is acknowledging the settings.json file, but doesn't seem to read anything from it.
