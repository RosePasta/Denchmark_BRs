	<summary>How to close Quadrotor sim, without crashing Unreal</summary>
	<description>
Hey all,
I am using Unreal on Ubuntu for Airsim.
Everytime i hit 'esc' or try to shut down the simulation in quadrotor mode, Unreal crashes.
This doesn't happen with car mode.
Anyone know how to kill the unreal airsim simulation while in quadrotor mode, without it crashing?
Thanks.

		If you run your simulation in standalone mode, even if the simulation crashes, the unreal editor will not crash.
