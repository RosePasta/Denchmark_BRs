	<summary>DQNcar in PythonClient is not working (will not converge)</summary>
	<description>
There is an example in PythonClient which applies DQN to run the car. However, I ran it for a long time and found it will not converge. Does anyone success?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/QiyuZ&gt;@QiyuZ&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thank you for reporting this issue.  This script was recently removed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3215&gt;#3215&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and replaced with a new script at \AirSim\PythonClient\reinforcement_learning\dqn_car.py that uses the new OpenAI gym wrapper. I tested the new script locally and it runs for me. Can you retest with the new script and report back if you see any issues?
