	<summary>simSetPose(): Copter collides on obstacle in direct path BUG</summary>
	<description>
I am using simSetPose() for the end of one episode to reset my copter position.
The problem is that simSetPose() seems to try to take a physical direct path from current position to the set-position. If there is an obstacle in the way the copter is stuck at that point.
This is very unfortunate if somebody wants to run 1000s of episodes, where you will run in this issue sooner or later.
Any ideas?
