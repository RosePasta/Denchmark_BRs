	<summary>Binaries are not working</summary>
	<description>
Hi I downloaded the NH environment from your binaries, but it doesn't work.
At the start, I choose multirotor ,so I click "No" and then it displays the following:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23744690/38857597-f5d7b234-4229-11e8-88f0-d676b2bafa89.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and then :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23744690/38857623-05727eb8-422a-11e8-9ff3-d5a1063b779b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried launching it on two different computers and I get the same error. I also tried to run the latest ZhangJiaJie, and the same error poped up. Those same error also happen when I try to select the car.
My belief is that, 5 days ago there were a few changes made, clockspeed for example, that made the build and the binaries not work. Then it got fixed for the build, but I don't think the binaries were updated...
Thanks

		Thanks for reporting the problem. I've updated the binaries for release 1.1.10 so it should work now.

 's issue is separate from the problem listed in this thread, let's track it in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/issues/1150&gt;#1150&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The issue in this thread should be solved with the current binary releases.
