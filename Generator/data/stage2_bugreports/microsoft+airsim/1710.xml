My error is as follows, anyone can help me ?

		I am also running into the same issue but with my own code. Also it happens pretty randomly.
My stack trace is same as soon as it hits numpy call:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;img2d = np.reshape(img1d, (responses[0].height, responses[0].width))
  File "/home/wxxx/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py", line 279, in reshape
    return _wrapfunc(a, 'reshape', newshape, order=order)
  File "/home/wxxx/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py", line 51, in _wrapfunc
    return getattr(obj, method)(*args, **kwds)
ValueError: cannot reshape array of size 1 into shape (0,0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I think its a bug in Airsim client.simGetImages API. The issue is the responses[0].height and responses[0].width returns 0. So the numpy reshape errors out once it encounters that.
The workaround I have is to check for the condition where the responses[0].width and responses[0].height is "0" and once that condition occurs, I pass dummy image ( all 1's) and then reset airsim so it doesn't crash simulation.

		Hi, thank you for reporting this issue.  This script was recently removed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/pull/3215&gt;#3215&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and replaced with a new script at \AirSim\PythonClient\reinforcement_learning\dqn_car.py that uses the new OpenAI gym wrapper. I tested the new script locally and it runs for me. Can you retest with the new script and report back if you see any issues?
