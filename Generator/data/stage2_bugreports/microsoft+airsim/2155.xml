	<summary>Lidar error in sitl,No lidar with name  exist on vehicle.</summary>
	<description>
I use Lidar in AirSim in python. I get the lidardata with
def getLidarData():
lidarData = client.getLidarData()
return lidarData
But it occurs an error,
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "pub_lidar_msg.py", line 147, in

File "pub_lidar_msg.py", line 137, in main

msgpackrpc.error.RPCError: rpclib: function 'getLidarData' (called with 2 arg(s)) threw an exception. The exception contained this information: No lidar with name  exist on vehicle.
And the below is my json file.

someone hit it?

		Folks -- This problem typically occurs when there is a mismatch of AirSim python client version and  AirSim plugin. Lidar support was added later in the cycle and sometimes folks are still running the old plugin which doesn't have the lidar code. Are you sure you have the matching AirSim plugin running?

		I have this issue (for C++ and python) even after reinstalling Unreal and AirSim so are you sure this is just a mismatch problem?

Hey So I installed Airsim recently (in the last 4 weeks) would it still be my airsim plugin that would be the issue? Would it not (at least for the lidar) be up to date?
