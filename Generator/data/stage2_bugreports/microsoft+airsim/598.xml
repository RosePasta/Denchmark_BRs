	<summary>3 error in Simple flight Mode</summary>
	<description>
My Computer Environment Specific
Windows 10
Unreal Engine 4.16.3
Airsim commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/commit/a4190ac68764cdfd08ca68cbaf29a840cfc184e3&gt;a4190ac&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Json Settings
"DefaultVehicleConfig": "SimpleFlight",
"PhysicsEngineName": "FastPhysicsEngine",

It is not work ignore_collision in simSetPose.
I try to  2 environment(One is just SimpleFlight the other is SimpleFlight &amp; computer vision mode)
My Python command
quat = client.getOrientation()
client.simSetPose(Pose(Vector3r(0,0,4),quat), True)

Ignore Collision is not work, So  Drone collision and stucks.


It is not work DrivetrainType.ForwardOnly option in moveByVelocity.
I want the drones to move in the direction they camera see.
So I use moveByVelocity &amp; fowardOnly option.
I rotate to yaw, And control drone, It move in direction first yaw.
How do I control move in the direction camera see?


moveByVelocity is not work, after simsetpose.
I try other command( moveByAngle, moveToPosition).
Also dose not work, after simSetPose


Python command
quat = client.getOrientation()
client.simSetPose(Pose(Vector3r(0,0,4),quat), True)
client.moveByVelocity(1,0,0,1)

		Any updates on this bug? I'm also facing this issue when trying to ignore collisions in computer vision mode.

		Yeah, and I'm facing the the simSetPose issue as well. Once this command is issued, issuing other commands have no affect.
