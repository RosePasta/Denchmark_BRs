	<summary>Segmentation view stays all green</summary>
	<description>
I'm running AirSim in the simple blocks environment, and while the main image and depth screens produce correct results, the segmentation view simply stays all green. I also tried it with in the Mountain Landscapes environment, with the same result. This is on Mac OS X with Integrated Intel Graphics.
I verified that meshes have a "CustomDepth Stencil Value" set to different values for different meshes, and "Render CustomDepth Pass" is enabled, and I tried setting "custom depth stencil pass" to "Enabled with Stencil" in the Project Settings. Are there other things I can try to make this work?

		Hi,
you need to setup different id for different objects. Example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;client.simSetSegmentationObjectID("[\w]*", 0, True);
client.simSetSegmentationObjectID("ground[\w]*", 1, True);
client.simSetSegmentationObjectID("road[\w]*", 2, True);
client.simSetSegmentationObjectID("sky[\w]*", 3, True);
client.simSetSegmentationObjectID("car[\w]*", 4, True);
client.simSetSegmentationObjectID("sign[\w]*", 5, True);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		AirSim uses feature in Unreal Engine called CustomStencil for segmentation view. I found couple of posts on Unreal forums that this feature is not working on Mac due to bug in Unreal:

SceneTexture:CustomStencil emits only zeroes on 4.18.2 Mac+Metal
"Buffer Visualization" &gt; "Custom Stencil" does not animate properly, is not readable [on mac]

You might want to contact Unreal support if you have access to them or file new post on &lt;denchmark-link:https://answers.unrealengine.com&gt;https://answers.unrealengine.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Turns out this works as intended after updating to High Sierra, as someone else also reported &lt;denchmark-link:https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/740168/scenetexturecustomstencil-emits-only-zeroes-on-418.html&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as well.
