	<summary>Increase mulitrotor speed for MovetoPosition in Unreal Engine</summary>
	<description>
I am using the simpleflight drone with Unreal 4.18, and am trying to travel across a very large map. However, if I increase the speed for the MoveToPosition API past 12, I get really bad instability for the drone in the vertical direction. I assume this is because it is switching between moving forward and upward to go faster while not losing altitude, so it seems like I just need to change a setting to give the drone stronger motors.
Is there anything I can do to increase the max velocity of the drone for MoveToPosition API in Unreal?

 Are you controlling the drone by the keyboard or computer code? If you use code, please share section of setting speed and moving the drone.
