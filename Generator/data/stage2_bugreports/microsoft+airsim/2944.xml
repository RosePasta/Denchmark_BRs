	<summary>Running AirSim in Unreal Engine Doesn't Work On Linux</summary>
	<description>
I want to run AirSim on my own environment. Therefore, I've tried to follow this guide: &lt;denchmark-link:https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_custenv/&gt;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/unreal_custenv/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It says that this won't work on Linux, because there is no Epic Games Launcher. But there is actually a Linux version of the Epic Games Launcher. (&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/Linux/BeginnerLinuxDeveloper/SettingUpAnUnrealWorkflow/index.html&gt;https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/Linux/BeginnerLinuxDeveloper/SettingUpAnUnrealWorkflow/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
So I've decided to give it a try and I created an Unreal Project, loaded in my assets and added the AirSim plugin as described. (add Plugins folder and edit .uproject file)
However I can't do the step "Generate Visual Studio Project Files", because I am on Linux. So I've tried to restart Unreal Engine, which results in this prompt:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34191949/90404271-7c1fbd00-e0a2-11ea-9007-954fb180fd55.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But when I click yes I get this error:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34191949/90404311-880b7f00-e0a2-11ea-943a-dbbbbf31e657.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So is there any chance for me to use AirSim with my own environment on Linux?

		Well, it's definitely possible, otherwise the Linux binaries wouldn't be there :)
The page says that there's no Unreal Launcher to access Marketplace and download envs, you can download them in Win and then copy the files to Linux.
It's the same process after that, just skip the Visual Studio step for Linux. I've written about it in ArduPilot's Wiki if you would like to take a look - &lt;denchmark-link:https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-with-airsim.html#custom-environment&gt;https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-with-airsim.html#custom-environment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

As for the compilation error, I think you missed running build.sh first from root directory before copying the Plugins/ folder to the custom env, build.sh copies the compiled AirLib, Mavlinkcom code to the Plugins folder, so that's required for the first time (or every time you make a change there)

 Oh wow thank you, I will try that tomorrow and let you know if it worked!

		Wow, it worked perfectly!
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rajat2004&gt;@rajat2004&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I am wondering how I can create a "packaged binary" as found in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/releases/tag/v1.3.1-linux&gt;sample environments&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
Because I don't want to start Unreal Engine every time I want to use my environment.

		See UE4's documentation - &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Basics/Projects/Packaging/index.html&gt;https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Basics/Projects/Packaging/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Packaging rebuilds a lot of the engine as well so it can take hours to package, especially on a laptop like mine
If you're packaging frequently, then there's an option to disable Full Rebuild, mentioned in the UE4 docs
Probably should add this info to docs
