Hi I got a problem when executing build.cmd.
Using Vs 2017 community, while building, it shows:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18409502/45077327-7633aa00-b11f-11e8-9292-e975f685fd0c.PNG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

From double to const float error.I tried to modify the source code however it doesn't work.
Could anyone tell me how to fix it?
