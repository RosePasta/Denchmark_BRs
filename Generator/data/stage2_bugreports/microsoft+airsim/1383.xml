		I want to use multiple vehicles. So, I change setting.json like that.
{
"SettingsVersion": 1.2,
"SimMode": "Car",
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"Vehicles": {
	"Car1": {
	  "VehicleType": "PhysXCar",
	  "X": 4, "Y": 0, "Z": -2
	},
	"Car2": {
	  "VehicleType": "PhysXCar",
	  "X": -4, "Y": 0, "Z": -2,
  "Yaw": 90
	}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

}
}
But, when I start the project, it turns to the default.

",

		That's strange. Do you have non-english OS? I suspect there is a bug in code that checks if file already exist and it doesn't take in to account unicode characters.
