	<summary>rotateToYawAsync() does nothing</summary>
	<description>
Hopefully I am just using this wrong, but when trying to rotate using rotateToYawAsync() nothing happens to the drone. I simply take off then call the rotate method.
client.rotateToYawAsync(90,5,1)
Has anyone had any luck using this. Is there a better way to have a drone turn in place? Is that possible?

		Please try with client.rotateToYawAsync(90,5,1).join()

		Yea nothing happens with adding join either. I am not seeing any errors. Maybe the function is just not hooked up? I have not gone through all the source code
closed issue by mistake

		I tried the function today and it worked, though there were some glitches.
Is it possible to share a code snippet?

		I forgot to mention I was using the python api and I am on ubuntu as well working off of the master branch from December. Here is the code
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import setup_path
import airsim
import numpy as np
import os
import tempfile
import pprint
import cv2
from PIL import Image
from array import array
import time

client = airsim.MultirotorClient()
client.confirmConnection()
client.enableApiControl(True)
client.armDisarm(True)

airsim.wait_key('Press any key to takeoff')
client.takeoffAsync().join()

airsim.wait_key('Press any key to rotate')
client.rotateToYawAsync(90,5,1).join()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am also using the defaults in terms of the json settings file (aka my file is blank minus the two required lines). Maybe I need to set something specific in there?

		Yes...!for me too its same,
The 4th param of rotateToYawAsync() expecting vehicle name...don''t know what to fill
def rotateToYawAsync(self, yaw, timeout_sec = 3e+38, margin = 5, vehicle_name = ''):
return self.client.call_async('rotateToYaw', yaw, timeout_sec, margin, vehicle_name)
had given the command like.....
airsim.wait_key('Press any key to rotate')
client.rotateToYawAsync(90,5,1).join()
(Airsim version -  1.2)

		I have the same problems. I test with rotateByYawRateAsync. It rotates. But when change it to rotateToYawAsync it fails and does nothing.

		I can use the rotateToYawAsync() but after a number of ratations the vehicles does not respond ...
