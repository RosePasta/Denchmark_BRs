	<summary>Error at startup: VehicleSetting for vehicle name BP_FlyingPawn_5 was requested but not found</summary>
	<description>
I followed the tutorial ( 9:27 in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oY8Qu5maQQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oY8Qu5maQQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) to create a drone by myself.
But it turned out "Error at startup: VehicleSetting for vehicle name BP_FlyingPawn_5 was requested but not found".
I followed the method below, but it still not works.
