		I just had this issue. This is talking about a conversion warning that I'm pretty sure isn't going to be fixed anytime soon, since msr::airlib::real_T is a struct with whatever precision they gave it.
What I would recommend (what I did), was go to the file  and scroll down in the XML until you find a section that looks like this.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32143517/99068879-4b550400-257b-11eb-9bfe-fdaec0af5f5b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Once you have that, look at the tag that says DisableSpecificWarnings and add in this particular warning, which is 4244. So that line for me since I'm using that particular configuration of "Debug | x64", would be:
&lt;DisableSpecificWarnings&gt;4100;4244;4505;4820;4464;4514;4710;4571;5205%(DisableSpecificWarnings)&lt;/DisableSpecificWarnings&gt;.
Once you have done that, do build.cmd again and it will compile no problem. Since it's only a conversion warning, there won't be any huge issues. Let me know if that works for you!

		Another way would be to add a static cast in the source files. So a PR can be submitted
