	<summary>The imu data is not accurate</summary>
	<description>
hi folks,
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/madratman&gt;@madratman&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
     I get the imu data by airsim.CarClient().getImuData(),
I recoded a piece of data about acrossing the curve road, then I fit the trajectory by using median integration, compare with the GPS trajectory, has something different
this is the image of the GPS trajectory and imu median integeration trajectoryï¼š

Link appears to be broken

I have tried it, good running...
there are two lines in the image , one GPS trajectory,  the other one is imu trajectory, the imu trajectory has obvious offset

		This may be related to a bug they're (hopefully) also currently investigating regarding improper car velocities &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/issues/1760&gt;#1760&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  ahaha, this problem has been solved  by an alternative method, get the imu data by speed scalar and orientation, I have checked it , it's no problem
