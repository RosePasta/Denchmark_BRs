 were you able to successfully build libAirsimWrapper.so by following the instructions &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/Unity/README.md&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
This error usually means that the library is not in the expected location.

		If you are using Ubuntu, the build script should generate a shared library (.so), not a dll. To see if it the library was built, navigate to Unity/linux-build. There should be a file in there called libAirSimWrapper.so . If that file doesn't exist, I would recommend cleaning out your repository and re-running the Unity/build.sh command.

		Turns out that only the latest bleeding edge of the Airsim API for Unity can be built, anything older has bugs. It is expected as Unity with Airsim is still experimental.
