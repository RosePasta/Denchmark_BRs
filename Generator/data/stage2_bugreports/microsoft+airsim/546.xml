	<summary>MAVLink V2 does not work</summary>
	<description>
When trying out the PX4 HIL mode on Ubuntu 16.04 using a Pixhawk (1.5.5), I was not able to takeoff because of message length mismatches. Although, some commands like arming/disarming seemed to work.

Changing the MAV_PROTO_VER parameter in QGC to "Always use version 1" fixed these errors.
