	<summary>UE4 sometimes crashes when standalone application is quit</summary>
	<description>
My system is Linux, (Ubuntu 18.04) and I've noticed that sometimes UE4 editor crashes when my standalone C++ application (which controls the drone running on UE4 AirSim simulator) is quit by Ctrl+C or of a crash.
This doesn't happen if the stand alone application has entered a loop where all contact with AirSim is stopped, which makes me think when the drone in AirSim receives an uncomplete transmission due to the standalone application crashing, there is an exception either on AirSim or on UE4 side.
Anyone experience the same issue?
Any leads on preventing such behaviour?
