	<summary>Timeout problem of a function like land()?</summary>
	<description>
the error occurred when my drone is high enough, and cannot land to ground in 60s. then UE editor shut down itself.( I'm under ubuntu 16.04 lts, ue4.17, airsim v1.1.10)
the error info is like this: "terminating with uncaught exception of type rpc::timeout: rpc::timeout: Timeout of 60000ms while calling RPC function 'land'
已放弃 (核心已转储)"
sorry for the chinese code, which means "already abandoned(kernel has been transferred and restored)
so, is this a bug or do i have to write my own land() to lower it down and then call the land()?

		my experience seems like, land() is not the only function that has such property?
