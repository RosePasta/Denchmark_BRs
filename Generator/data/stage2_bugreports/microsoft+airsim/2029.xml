	<summary>The location of the propeller is moved.</summary>
	<description>
I am using my default model(BP_FlyingPawn), and recently I found that the propellers would shift a little after a long flight. What is the problem? Is there solution?

		I noticed the same issue. Mine shifted 45 degree after a long run, and started to block my camera. Any fix?
