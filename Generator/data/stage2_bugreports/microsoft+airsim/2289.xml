	<summary>Run Error while using DQNcar.py</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I have finally got to the stage where I can run the DQNcar.py and once it connects to server the car just constently respawns practically everytime it hits the ground. What is the issue? I have had a look into the script but I am struggling to find any answers there or elsewhere online.
Pic shows the issue, I do have the same issue on City Environment but cannot get a client server connection on AirSimNH for some reason.
Phython 3.5 (cannot get cntk on python 3.7?)
AirSim-v.1.2.2

		This is a separate issue from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/issues/1009&gt;#1009&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I am seeing the same behavior with the new \AirSim\PythonClient\reinforcement_learning\dqn_car.py script in the blocks environment. Additional investigation is required here.

		After investigating this further, I found that the dqn_car.py script is designed to only work with the AirSimNH/Neighborhood environment. Please see &lt;denchmark-link:https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/reinforcement_learning/#rl-with-car&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for additional details.
