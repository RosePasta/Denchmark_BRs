	<summary>Failure of div function</summary>
	<description>
The div function in Pond protocol supports a public divisor y. The protocol handles y as calculate its inverse (1 / y.decode()) and multiple it with the dividend x. However this inverse is a tensor (after decode) and is incompatible with the lift function in mul.
An error occurs:
TypeError: Don't know how to lift &lt;class 'tf_encrypted.protocol.pond.pond.PondPrivateVariable'&gt;, &lt;class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.Tensor'&gt;

		One fix would be to implement and use &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/reciprocal&gt;tf.reciprocal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for public tensors (eg decode, compute native reciprocal, encode).
In the particular case reported here this will result in a multiplication between a private variable and a public tensor, which will be properly handled by lift and in turn mul.
