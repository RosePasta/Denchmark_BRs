	<summary>Converter tests failing on TF 1.14.0</summary>
	<description>
Bug can be reproduced by simply running the tests (python -m pytest -k convert_test) with TF 1.14.0 installed.

		I have started to investigate these bugs.
None deterministic test
The converter tests fails for keras layers because even if we have set the [tf seed], for some reasons the tf layer doesn't returns the same output after the layer get restored from the exported graph. Setting the seed in the kernel initializer solve the problem. For example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; d = Dense(2,
       kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.RandomNormal(seed=1),
       input_shape=shape[1:])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


In tf 1.14, they have introduced this&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/456fbc0e498e3d10604973de9f46ca48d62267cc/tensorflow/python/framework/graph_util_impl.py#L246&gt; new check&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in . It raises an error when we export the graph to a pb file.
Not sure yet how to fix this.

Can't export the Keras batchnorm layer to a pb file

Interestingly this is different than whats on master: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/graph_util_impl.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/graph_util_impl.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		ah nice find &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/justin1121&gt;@justin1121&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! Maybe we could have a copy of the graph utils file (Master or tf 1.13 version) and call  from it.
What do you guys think?
