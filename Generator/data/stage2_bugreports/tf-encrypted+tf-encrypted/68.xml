	<summary>to_native not working in some cases</summary>
	<description>
Seems like to_native on int100 tensor isn't working in some cases.

 ran into this issue and I did as well, not 100% sure what causes it because it generally works.
this can reproduce it, though
input = np.array((1,0,1,0, 0,1,0,1, 1,0,1,0, 0,1,0,1)).reshape(1, 4, 4, 1)
pool_input = prot.define_public_variable(input)
x = pool_input.reshape(1, 1, 4, 4)
x = x.im2col(whatever)
print(f'wow! {x}') # this will call `__repr__` which will call `to_native`
