	<summary>Error in export_2hlayers_model.py InvalidArgumentError: Cannot assign a device for operation private-input/encode/mul</summary>

I ran the export_2hlayers_model.py example and got this error. I ran it on a Macbook pro CPU.
Complete error goes like

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kamathhrishi&gt;@kamathhrishi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I think I've seen errors like this if running with tensorflow eager mode enabled. I assume that's probably not getting enabled somehow but can you confirm? Also what version of tensorflow are you using? I'd recommend using tensorflow 1.12.0 if possible.
Another thing I noticed is that you're running in an ipython shell. Maybe it's possible this shell is restricting access to all of the CPUs available. As it's saying it can't find /job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:3.

		I got this issue resolved. Not really sure why and how since all I did was remove my conda environment and create it again with tensorflow 1.12

 Hey, I get the same error. I use virtualenv.
tensorflow eager mode is not enabled and I tried changing tf version from 1.13.1 to 1.12.0 but it didn't solve it.
Do you have any idea of what else can be the issue?

 can you send your exact error output? Could be something slightly different. Thanks.

 this is what I get (after changing to tf 1.12.0)

 I'm stumped! If you'd be willing to share your code that could be helpful. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mortendahl&gt;@mortendahl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you have any ideas on what this could be?

		it looks like this is slightly different than the original bug for this issue -- there it looked the problem was conflicting devices, this looks more like it's at the task level.  the original code would definitely help to investigate further

I found the problem - I was running each server using a script that first wrote it's IP address to the config.json file and then started the tfe server. The problem was that I didn't wait untill everyone else finished writing to the config file to start the servers.
I do have a different problem now, which probably belong to a different issue - my code works fine when using local config, but when I change to remote config and run the exact same code -  its not working anymore.
