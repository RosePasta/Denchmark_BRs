	<summary>Failed to import packages from hyperparameter_hunter</summary>
	<description>
It is very strange that I could not import any packages from hyperparameter_hunter
I installed hyperparameter_hunter from github and wrote a script that has only three lines with name 'test.py' and the code is as below
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/pull/1&gt;#1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from hyperparameter_hunter import Environment, CVExperiment
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/2&gt;#2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from hyperparameter_hunter import RandomForestOptPro, Real, Integer, Categorical
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter/issues/3&gt;#3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 print("test")
When I run "python test.py", nothing is shown on the screen. However, when the first two lines are commented, "test" is printted on the screen.
Anyone knows what is the problem?

Can you try installing the maint/pytest-version-conflict branch to see if that takes care of the issue for you?
pip install git+https://github.com/HunterMcGushion/hyperparameter_hunter.git@maint/pytest-version-conflict
