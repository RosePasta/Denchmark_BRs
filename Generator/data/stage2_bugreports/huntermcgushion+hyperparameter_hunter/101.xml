	<summary>Best score not printed correctly after optimization with minimized metrics</summary>
	<description>

This is the optimization_core.BaseOptimizationProtocol._optimization_loop bug marked in d87be18
Problem is purely visual and has no effect on the actual optimization routine or its results
Currently, best_experiment and best_score are updated when current_score is strictly greater than best_score

This ignores metrics that are minimized (loss/error) and, in fact, prints the opposite of what would be expected
Needs to be adjusted to update best values properly when target_metric direction is "min"


Can be handled like reporting.OptimizationReporter.print_result's comparison to its y_max attribute, using highlight_max
