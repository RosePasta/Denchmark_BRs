	<summary>Delete temp `build_fn` file created for Keras optimization</summary>
	<description>

See :func:library_helpers.keras_optimization_helper.keras_prep_workflow
Originally, temp files were deleted immediately after import, but this made it impossible to hash build_fn in key_handler.hash_callable
This may not be a problem anymore once #51 is resolved

Just return to deleting temp files immediately after import?
