	<summary>Optimization logging not set when preceded by `Experiment`</summary>
	<description>

Problem occurs when executing examples/lib_keras_optimization_example.py
OptimizationProtocol logging should silence the logging of individual Experiments by default, but that doesn't happen here
This seems to only happen when an Experiment is conducted in the same active Environment as the OptimizationProtocol, as this isn't an issue for any of the other optimization examples

Likely issue with overwriting logging parameters in Environment/Experiment
