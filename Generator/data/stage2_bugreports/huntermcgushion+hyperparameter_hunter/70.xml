<bug id='70' author='HunterMcGushion' open_date='2018-09-11T21:00:41Z' closed_time='2018-11-15T05:10:11Z'>
	<summary>Leaderboard's 'experiment_#' column out of order</summary>
	<description>

In 'GlobalLeaderboard.csv', the 'experiment_#' column appears after 'oof_roc_auc_score', and before 'oof_f1_score'
This can be replicated by running the one-off Experiment scripts in 'HyperparameterHunter/experiments'.

'lib_lightgbm_example.py' is the only one that actually includes 'f1_score' in :attr:hyperparameter_hunter.environment.Environment.metrics_map, so problem must be occurring there during leaderboard updating/column reordering


Just in case, exact steps that led to this bug are as follows:

Delete 'HyperparameterHunterAssets' to start from scratch
In terminal, activate virtual environment, and cd to 'hyperparameter_hunter/examples'
python lib_catboost_example.py
python lib_keras_example.py
python lib_keras_image_classification_example.py
python lib_lightgbm_example.py
python lib_rgf_example.py
python lib_sklearn_example.py
python lib_xgboost_example.py


Above steps should produce a 'hyperparameter_hunter/examples/HyperparameterHunterAssets/Leaderboards/GlobalLeaderboard.csv' file with a total of 18 Experiment entries
