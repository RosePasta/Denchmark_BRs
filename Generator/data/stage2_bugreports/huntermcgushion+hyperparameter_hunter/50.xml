	<summary>Keras learning rate recorded incorrectly when decay/scheduling callbacks used</summary>
	<description>

See :meth:recorders.DescriptionRecorder.format_result
Model's get_config() returns the final learning rate, rather than the initial one, so experiment description files are misleading by not displaying the actual value used
Leads to failed similar experiment matches
Experiment started with Adam at lr=0.001, and ReduceLROnPlateau, which dropped the lr down to 0.0001

0.0001 was recorded as the Experiment's lr, but it should be 0.001


Probably need to call parameterize_compiled_keras_model immediately after initializing it, then store the results, then use them in the DescriptionRecorder

Midway through experiments.BaseCVExperiment.cv_run_workflow, or in models.KerasModel.initialize_model/fit
