	<summary>Very serious performance problem found that alluxio will have a long tail effec</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.2.1
Describe the bug
Alluxio acceleration effect, found that alluxio will have a long tail effect, which causes some tasks to be particularly time-consuming. Compared with HDFS, there is no obvious advantage.
To Reproduce
excute spark shell
or
excute TestDFSIO also can reeproduce
Expected behavior
so smart read performance
Urgency
I think it is urgency
Additional context
`#~/cloud/alluxio/bin/alluxio fs mkdir -p /xubo/project/SparkSW/input/
for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
echo 'time:'$i
for j in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
sh test.sh 10G  hdfs://Master:9000/xubo/project/SparkSW/input/'D'$i'Line.fasta' hdfs://Master:9000/xubo/project/alluxio/output/TimeCount
#sh test.sh 10G  alluxio://Master:19998/xubo/alluxio/uniref/'D'$j'Line.fasta' hdfs://Master:9000/xubo/project/alluxio/output/TimeCount
#sh test.sh 10G  alluxio://Master:19998/xubo/project/SparkSW/input/'D'$j'Line.fasta' alluxio://Master:19998/xubo/project/alluxio/output/TimeCount
done
for j in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
sh test.sh 10G  alluxio://Master:19998/xubo/project/SparkSW/input/'D'$i'Line.fasta' hdfs://Master:9000/xubo/project/alluxio/output/TimeCount
done
done`

		This issue doesn't have enough information to determine if there are any mis-configurations or errors. If you see poor performance then you'll need to answer a few things:

Is the data already cached in Alluxio?
Which UFS are you using?
If you aren't using a cloud-based UFS like AWS S3, is the data in the UFS co-located with Alluxio or in a separate remote cluster somewhere?

You also should share:

alluxio-site.properties
Your cluster architecture
Look for any errors in the master.log, job_master.log, worker.log, or job_worker.log` and share them here.
The exact benchmark workload that is being run. The information about your script you provided doesn't tell us much about what kind of workload you're actually running.
