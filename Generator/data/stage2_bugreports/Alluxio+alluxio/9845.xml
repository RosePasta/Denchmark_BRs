	<summary>Rapid leader transition causes web-server leak</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0+
Describe the bug
In a quick fail-over from follower -&gt; leader -&gt; follower, a web server could leak. So the node will never be able to become a leader gain due to not being able to bind to port.
To Reproduce
Cause a quick transition of master role as described.
Expected behavior
We should not leak any resources during a quick state transition.
