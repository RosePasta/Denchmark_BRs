		I wasn't able to reproduce this issue. Here's what I did:

Connect Alluxio to secure HDFS. Alluxio version 2.0.0-RC4. This is done following guide Alluxio connect to secure HDFS.
Start spark shell specifying principal and keytab "spark-shell --principal hdfs/alluxio@ALLUXIO.COM --keytab {path_to_keytab}/alluxio.keytab"
Read and write parquet file from and to Alluxio and HDFS. I was able to do both without running into the exception in Alluxio BlockInputStream.

Closing this ticket since I don't have enough information. I'll re-open it if the original reporter replies and provides more details.
