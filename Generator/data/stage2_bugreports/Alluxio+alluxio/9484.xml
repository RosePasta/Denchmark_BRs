	<summary>Query parameters are propagated incorrectly in the web ui</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0.0
Describe the bug
When pressing the Go button on the browse page, it keeps all query parameters including offset and limit. This causes problems when browsing a large directory and going to a smaller directory.
To Reproduce
Create a folder with &gt; 20 files (to activate pagination).
Go to the second page.
Press Go to return to the root (&lt; 20 files)
Expected behavior
User is brought to the appropriate first paginated page of the destination.
