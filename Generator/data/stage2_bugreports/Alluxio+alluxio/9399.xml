	<summary>Add noEvictor class to one layer of tieredstore</summary>
	<description>
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
In Deep learning scenario, we are using MEM layer to speed up training speed. But the eviction action in MEM layer produces additional overhead.
Describe the solution you'd like
Can we add noEvictor to alluxio.worker.evictor.class, and make it for MEM layer? it just doesn't add more data to MEM layer. And the deep learning application can be benefit with the memory layer without swap in and out.

  thanks for proposing the idea. Wondering if command (&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.alluxio.io/os/user/2.0/en/basic/Command-Line-Interface.html#pin&gt;doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) could work for you for this particular purpose? Basically, "pinned" data in Alluxio space will not be evicted out.

		Yes, I think this one should be good for my scenario. I will try it later.

 , I see the following error. As you know the data for training is always read-only. Any suggestions?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/opt/alluxio/bin/alluxio fs pin  /training-data/images/
A write operation on /training-data/images under a readonly mount point /training-data/images is not allowed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Pin should not be a write operation.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cheyang&gt;@cheyang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  let me fix this issue by PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/9460&gt;#9460&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
