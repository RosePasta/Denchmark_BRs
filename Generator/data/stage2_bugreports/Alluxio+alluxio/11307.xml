	<summary>Too many EventLoops increase netty footprint</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0+
Describe the bug
Alluxio allows an event-loop per physical connection.
This has 2 issues:
1- Event-loop will leak if the connection is not properly released.
2- It gives an inefficient use underlying netty architecture.
To Reproduce
Don't close FileSystems.
Expected behavior
Event-loops for clients should be unified per category. Namely a DEFAULT event-loop and  STREAMING event-loop.
