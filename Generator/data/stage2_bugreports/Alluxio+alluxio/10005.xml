		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yoock&gt;@yoock&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, you'll need to describe this in more detail.

Can you more clearly define the set of operations that triggers this and the time frame which they occur?
Do you know which heartbeat is causing the GC? i.e. worker-master, replication check, etc..?

Hi @yoock, you'll need to describe this in more detail.

Can you more clearly define the set of operations and the time frame which they occur?

Do you know which heartbeat is causing the GC?
