	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0.0
Describe the bug
Displaying file with 0 byte offset from the end in the UI creates a blank page. This seems to only happen with the logs page (possibly only if the UFS is local).
To Reproduce
Open a log file.
Check the display relative from to end from start.
Press Go
Expected behavior
A page with an empty data box but still has the other controls.
