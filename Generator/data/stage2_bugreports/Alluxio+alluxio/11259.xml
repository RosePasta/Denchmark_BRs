	<summary>Incorrect state change lock may cause inconsistent backups</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
1.8 and master
Describe the bug
Backups may be inconsistent, while RPCs are in-progress when the backup is started.
To Reproduce
Have many RPCs in progress, and start the backup.
Expected behavior
The backup is taken with the exclusive lock on the state of the system, without in-progress RPCs running.
Urgency
Critical for consistent backups.
Additional context
This is caused by the state change lock not being held for the duration of the RPC.
