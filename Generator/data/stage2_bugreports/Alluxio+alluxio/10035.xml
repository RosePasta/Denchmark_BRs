	<summary>Wasteful UFS RPC calls for HDFS</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.x and 1.8.x
Describe the bug
List on HDFS UFS issues a separate getBlockSizeBytes HDFS call for each file. This is a redundant RPC that can be removed.
To Reproduce
Mount an HDFS cluster, and open the Alluxio Metrics JSON endpoint. Run a list directory call on the Alluxio directory that has the mounted HDFS and then monitor the UFS metrics for getBlockSizeBytes RPC calls.
Expected behavior
No increase in getBlockSizeBytes since the available information is already provided via Hadoop API's getStatus.
Urgency
High
Additional context
Results in severe latency when bulk listing objects since the getBlockByteSize calls are done serially.
