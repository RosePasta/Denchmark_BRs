	<summary>SetAttribute operations will always loadmetadata</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
v2.0.0
Describe the bug
For FS operations implemented by the master-side API setAttribute, including pin, setTtl, chmod, chown, chgrp, setReplication, loadMetadataInterval on server side will always be 0 due to the missing commonOptions in SetAttributeOptions. This results always unnecessary, possibly too much UFS load metadata operations even the file metadata has been cached already.
To Reproduce
mount a local fs containing file foo then fs pin this file which will succeed.
versus in 1.8 one needs fs ls first before being able to fs pin
Expected behavior
Two possible options:

convert back to behavior of 1.8 that makes default synInterval -1 instead of 0 (due to protobuf)
introduce a new behavior that it will sync on-demand for the first time, and follows sync interval in the future

Urgency
High
