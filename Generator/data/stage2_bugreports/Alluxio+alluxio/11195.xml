		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/justKidrauhl&gt;@justKidrauhl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, Alluxio does not currently support any windows platforms. You'll need to build and run Alluxio on a Linux or MacOS-based operating system.
Another option which you can try (but is not supported), is to compile directly through the command line using &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10&gt;WSL&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can also try using VirtualBox to launch a CentOS/Ubuntu VM which you can then install IntelliJ and maven on.
Hope this helps. I'm closing this issue because we don't support windows, and I don't think that we will. If you still have issues compiling on other platforms you can re-open this issue
