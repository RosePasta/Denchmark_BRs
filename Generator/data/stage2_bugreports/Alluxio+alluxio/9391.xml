I think this should be in document to make the user understand the HA strategy in Kubernetes. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apc999&gt;@apc999&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Hi, dear all. I'm a newer for Alluxio, and want to deploy Alluxio 2.0 on a product cluster, but from the latest official doc, I got this note.

Note: Embedded Journal configuration is not supported on Kubernetes.

I do really have no much knowledges of Embedded Journal implementation, so could you give me some clues for that caution?
Thanks a lot.
