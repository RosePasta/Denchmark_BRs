 Can you please describe the issue with more detail? What kind of deployment are you using? We will need more information to reproduce.
When I run Alluxio locally and navigate to+from the master and worker UI, I am having no issues.

  - I'm running alluxio in master/worker mode in AWS EMR , started alluxio master in emr master node and worker in EMR core node.
'Return to Master' from worker webui its not working, looks like it's trying to open alluxio master webui with worker node hostname

 How are you getting to the Alluxio Worker WebUI? Are you providing the public IP address? The links are all based on internal EC2 hostnames. One way to get this to work is to map the internal hostnames to the external IP addresses in your /etc/hosts file (on Linux/Mac).
