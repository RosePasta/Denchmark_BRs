	<summary>Issue creating UFS file without a parent directory</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.x
Describe the bug
We have been using default CreateOptions when creating a UFS file. This can fail in some configuration when a file is written to an Alluxio directory not backed by a UFS one.
To Reproduce
Create a file in Alluxio with CACHE_THROUGH and under a directory not backed by UFS.
Expected behavior
Creation should succeed and the parent directory should be created in UFS.
Urgency
Medium. Some data migration tasks may fail.
Additional context
N/A
