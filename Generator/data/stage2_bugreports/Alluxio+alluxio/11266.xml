	<summary>Sync on S3 can set the owner to "" or "_"</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.2
Describe the bug
S3 does not set owner/group for objects when inherit_acl=false. When syncing metadata with s3, an updateMetadata sync plan could lead to setting the owner and group to _ in DefaultFileSystemMaster::setAttributeSingleFile or to "" (empty) when updating inode entry during sync
To Reproduce
This can be reproduced when a directory is created in alluxio only, the same directory is then later created in the ufs and then synced.
Steps to reproduce:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ aws s3 ls s3://adit-bucket-west/
                           PRE /
$ afs mkdir /adit
Successfully created directory /adit
$ afs mount /adit/s3a s3a://adit-bucket-west/
Mounted s3a://adit-bucket-west/ at /adit/s3a
$ afs mkdir /adit/s3a/nested
Successfully created directory /adit/s3a/nested
$ aws s3 cp world s3://adit-bucket-west/nested/file
upload: ./world to s3://adit-bucket-west/nested/file
$ afs ls -Dalluxio.user.file.metadata.sync.interval=0 /adit/s3a/nested
-rwx------  _              _                            6       PERSISTED 04-09-2020 22:22:18:000   0% /adit/s3a/nested/file
$ afs ls /adit/s3a/
drwx------  _              _                            1       PERSISTED 04-09-2020 22:22:18:000  DIR /adit/s3a/nested
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
Owner and group inherited from parent dir previously should not be modified.
