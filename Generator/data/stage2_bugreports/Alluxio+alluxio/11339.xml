	<summary>Ufs recursive listStatus strips out leading character from path</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.3.0-SNAPSHOT
Describe the bug
When syncing / loading a path from the UFS into Alluxio, the path in Alluxio may not reflect the path in HDFS as the leading character is incorrectly stripped out.
To Reproduce

Created dir /tmp in HDFS
Start Alluxio with root mount = root of HDFS
Start sync immediately upon Alluxio startup
/tmp in HDFS shows up as /mp in Alluxio

Expected behavior
/tmp in HDFS should show up as /tmp in Alluxio
Urgency
Urgent, sync on root on Alluxio namespace is unusable as it is incorrect.
Additional context
There are other scenarios in which this bug will also manifest.
