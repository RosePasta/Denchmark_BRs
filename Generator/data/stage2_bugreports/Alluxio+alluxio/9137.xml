	<summary>WebUI gets an index out of bounds error for large directories</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0.0-preview
Describe the bug
When trying to access a directory with over 1 thousand files, the browse REST endpoint throws an error. It is not 100% known that the error is due to the number of files.
To Reproduce
Create a directory with 1000 files, try to access it through the browse page on the UI.
Expected behavior
The UI displays the files in the directory.
Urgency
Urgent, this prevents users from using the WebUI.
Additional context
Master side error:
RestUtils - Unexpected error invoking rest endpoint: Index: 0, Size: 0

		Attempted to recreate the bug in both 2.0.0-preview and master and was not able to reproduce. I made a new directory and created copies from a single file until there were over 1000 files. I was able to browse the directory in the WebUI with no errors.
