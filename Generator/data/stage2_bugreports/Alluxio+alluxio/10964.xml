	<summary>Reduce the amount of GetWorkerInfoList in Job servers</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
Alluxio 2.2 and older versions
Describe the bug
AlluxioBlockStore is designed for clients and should not be used for Job servers.
However, Job master and job worker keep calling AlluxioBlockStore.getAllWorkers() which directly call BlockMaster.getWorkerInfoList(). Most of those calls are unneeded and a bunch of getWorkerInfoList() call increase the RPC network overhead between leading master and job servers.
To Reproduce
A persist/load job will call getWorkerInfoList() for 2-3 times. One on the master side to select executors. one or two on the worker side when doing actual loadBlock/persist jobs.
Expected behavior
A class similar to AlluxioBlockStore should exist and work for Job server only. This class should cache the getWorkerInfoList() and refresh the list if needed. This can reduce the total amount RPC network traffic.
Urgency
This can improve performance.
