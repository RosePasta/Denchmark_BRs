	<summary>TTL buckets are not updated upon removal of an inode</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0+
Describe the bug
TTL buckets are not updated upon removal of an inode. This leaves stale entries in TTL buckets until they are purged by the TTL checker.
Expected behavior
TTL buckets should be kept in sync with inode tree state.
Additional context
In a high churn-rate workload where files are created and deleted, failure to find these stale entries dominate master logs after a fail-over.
