	<summary>Attaching a UDB with many tables issues too many UDB RPCs in parallel</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.2.0
Describe the bug
When you attach a UDB that has many tables, syncing the UDB creates many parallel threads issuing commands/RPCs to the UDB. This has the potential to overload and stress the UDB too much.
To Reproduce
Attach a UDB that has a many tables (1000+) and monitor the connections to the UDB.
Expected behavior
The expectation is to be able to limit the parallelism of the sync, to limit the load to the UDB.
Urgency
This is critical to be able to attach large databases.
