	<summary>UfsJournal ignores unrecognized journal entries</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
Describe the bug
An unrecognized journal entry is simply ignored.
To Reproduce

Write a journal entry newly added in v2.x
Read journal from v2.y &lt; v2.x
Master starts up successfully

Expected behavior
Master should crash with IllegalStateException as a journal entry was unrecognized
Urgency
Medium, this an an early detection of journal compatibility
Additional context
EmbeddedJournal calls JournalAssociation and will throw an IllegalStateException whereas UfsJournal does not

		UfsJournal did/does not need the JournalAssociation method, since each master reads its own journal files, so all those entries are known to belong to the that specific master.

 ignores the return value, which should signify if the master recognizes the entry or not.
