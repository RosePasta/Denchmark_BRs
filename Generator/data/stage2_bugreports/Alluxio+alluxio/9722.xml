	<summary>Address edge cases in UFS journal recovery in case of UFS failure</summary>
	<description>

2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
Describe the bug
When we fail to flush journal entries to the UFS, our internal state may become out of sync with the external journal files if using UFS journal.
To Reproduce
Fail to flush to the UFS and then successfully flush to the UFS.
Expected behavior
The journal files are repaired and operation resumes as usual after the UFS is available.
