	<summary>Fix display from byte offset field in the web ui</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0.0
Describe the bug
Display from byte offset field will not allow empty values. This is confusing to the user because they generally will try to backspace the 0 before entering the number they want.
To Reproduce
Go to browse -&gt; click a file. Try to modify the display from byte offset field.
Expected behavior
The zero is deleted and the user is free to type the number of their choice.
