	<summary>Use alluxio scheme and master ip to access alluxio failed</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0.0
Describe the bug
i configured alluxio.master.hostname=BJLFRZ-10k-214-99.hadoop.jd.local in the alluxio.properties, and i access alluxio use alluxio://ip:port/, but i failed. But, it succeed if i use the configured host.
To Reproduce
$ alluxio fs ls  alluxio://172.1.0.99:19998/
The URI authority 172.1.0.99:19998 does not match the configured value of host_172_1_0_99:19998.
Expected behavior
i think use both ip and hostname should access alluxio successfully.
Urgency
HIGHEST
Additional context
NO

 why is the hostname being set differently between  vs in the URI? If you're setting the host in properties, you can use a URI like  instead, is that an option for you?
