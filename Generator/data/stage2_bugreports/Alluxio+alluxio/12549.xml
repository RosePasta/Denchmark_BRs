	<summary>alluxio worker/jobworker failed to start if changing rpc/data/web ports in yaml</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
alluxio-2.3-fuse
Describe the bug
I'm using kubectl to deploy alluxio. The deployment failed after I updated alluxio worker/jobworker rpc/data/web ports, in alluxio-config.yaml and alluxio-worker-daemonset.yaml
The worker pods failed to start with k8s probe failures.
To Reproduce

in alluxio-config.yaml, env ALLUXIO_JOB_WORKER_JAVA_OPTS, change options to: -Dalluxio.job.worker.rpc.port=30301 -Dalluxio.job.worker.data.port=30302 -Dalluxio.job.worker.web.port=30303
update according ports in alluxio-worker-daemonset.yaml
deploy alluxio-config.yaml master, worker sequentially.

Expected behavior
alluxio master/worker pods are started successfully.
actually, alluxio work pods can't be started due to probe failures.
Urgency
Medium
