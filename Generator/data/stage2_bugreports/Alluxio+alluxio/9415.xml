	<summary>Support limit of name length by Alluxio FUSE</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.0
Generally, Linux limits the length of file and directory within 255 characters.
But Alluxio fuse doesn't limit the length of file or directory name.
Copying file or directory from Alluxio fuse to other File System may fail, because of file name is too long.
Otherwise, POSIX-compliant File System test tool (like fstest) will check the length of file and directory within 255 characters or not.
