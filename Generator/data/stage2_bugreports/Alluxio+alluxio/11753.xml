	<summary>Block locations are incorrect when using ROCKS</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.3.0
Describe the bug
Block locations are incorrect when using ROCKS store. Even when a particular block is not loaded into Alluxio storage, that block has various block locations and duplicate locations.
To Reproduce
Set alluxio.master.metastore=ROCKS
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./bin/alluxio fs copyFromLocal LICENSE /a
./bin/alluxio fs copyFromLocal LICENSE /b
./bin/alluxio fs free /

# load only b
./bin/alluxio fs load /b

./bin/alluxio fs stat /a
./bin/alluxio fs stat /b
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
Only /b should have block locations, but both files will have block locations.
Urgency
Critical.
Additional context
This probably affects earlier versions.
