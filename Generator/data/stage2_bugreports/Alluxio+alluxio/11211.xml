	<summary>Configuration sync does not get raw property value</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.2
Describe the bug
Master is not giving raw configuration property value to worker, so worker gets some property value evaluated under master environment. For example, alluxio.underfs.hdfs.configuration is evaluated to master path that might be incorrect in worker.
To Reproduce
Have Alluxio master and worker with different installation path and mount hdfs with core-site.xml in conf folder. Then execute alluxio runTests and see HDFS error message in worker log.
Expected behavior
worker should be able to talk to HDFS.
Urgency
Medium, a few users have reported this issue.
