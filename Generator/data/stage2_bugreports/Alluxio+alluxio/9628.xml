	<summary>Metrics JSON endpoint not reporting correct UFS metrics</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
1.8.2
Describe the bug
UFS metrics are not reported correctly. When creating two different mount points on the same HDFS cluster, operations on the second mount point are incorrectly reported to the first mount point.
To Reproduce
Mount two different directories from an HDFS cluster into the same Alluxio cluster. RunTests on the second mount directory. Check the /metrics/json/ endpoint and see the value of getBlockSizeBytes().
Expected behavior
Operations like getBlockSizeBytes should be reported based on which mount point they were run on instead of aggregating in the first mount point.
Urgency
Medium
Additional context
Was not able to reproduce in 2.x
