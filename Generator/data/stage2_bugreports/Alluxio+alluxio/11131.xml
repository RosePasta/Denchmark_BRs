	<summary>NPE during attachdb if ownerType is null</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.1.2
Describe the bug
If the hive database ownerType is null, it causes a NPE, and fails to attach the db. The output is something like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Failed to connect underDb for Alluxio db 'test_db': null
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
Hive database ownerType is an optional field and may be null. When this happens, attaching a db fails.
Expected behavior
Attach should still be successful.
Urgency
Critical, to be able to attach a db.
