Alluxio Version:
2.0.0
Describe the bug
After the master pod is restarted on a different host, workers or long-running clients fail to connect the new master.
To Reproduce

start master
start workers, workers register with master
restart master on different node (different ip). note: the master address is specified as alluxio-master which now points to a different ip now
workers don't connect to the new master in the user's env and continue to see messages like

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2019-07-10 22:45:42,284 WARN  ChannelAuthenticator - Channel authentication failed. ChannelId: e215b3ed-5662-4416-a1b3-dbde1a0d88f2, AuthType: SIMPLE, Target: alluxio-master:19998, Error: alluxio.exception.status.UnavailableException: io exception
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
Worker register with new master after resolving the service name alluxio-master transparently.
Urgency
Urgent. No master fault tolerance w/o a resolution.
Additional context
Our gRPC channel utility attempt to resolve the address only when it's not resolved already. So if the client is stuck with old resolved address, it would supply gRPC with it and we would see this.
