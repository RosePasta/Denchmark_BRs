Describe the bug
In a condition where a channel creation succeeds but getRemoteServiceVersion() always fails;
retryRpcInternal will call disconnect after the RPC fails, then connect again on the next attempt.  connect will call getRemoteServiceVersion() again in the call chain because disconnect was called.
