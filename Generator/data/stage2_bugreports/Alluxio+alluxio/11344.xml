	<summary>Config hash thread is leaked for long-running client w/o close</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
2.2.1
Describe the bug
For long running Alluxio clients such as yarn RM, hive or presto daemons when the filesystem instance is not closed, we leak 1 config hash thread per context.
To Reproduce
Filesystem is cached on subject, submit multiple jobs (such as a spark count) to yarn w/ a different subject and jstack the RM.
Expected behavior
The config hash thread count should remain a constant over time irrespective of the number of jobs executed.
Urgency
Low
Additional context
