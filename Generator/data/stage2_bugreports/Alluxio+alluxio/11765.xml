	<summary>Incorrect cache update strategy in MetadataCachingBaseFileSystem</summary>
	<description>
Alluxio Version:
v2.2.0
Describe the bug
meta data may be deleted in client cache although it is very hot.
Now MetadataCache holds mStatus which stores the current file/dir status and mDirStatuses which stores the children status.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  private class CachedItem {
    private final URIStatus mStatus;
    private final List&lt;URIStatus&gt; mDirStatuses;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


For example, There is a path '/A/B/C'.
We run the listStatus request on the directory '/A/B'. After receiving result from alluxio master, it caches 'A/B' into the cache map which stores the children status for the path '/A/B' as mDirStatuses and its children '/A/B/C' into the cach map which stores the file/dir status as mStatus.
Then we run the listStatus request on the directory '/A'. After receiving result from alluxio master, it caches '/A' into the cache map which stores the children status for the path '/A' as mDirStatuses  and its children '/A/B' into the cach map which stores the file/dir status as mStatus. It replaces the previous content with a new CachedItem for '/A/B'.

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;public void put(AlluxioURI dir, List&lt;URIStatus&gt; statuses) {
    mCache.put(dir.getPath(), new CachedItem(statuses));
    for (URIStatus status : statuses) {
      mCache.put(status.getPath(), new CachedItem(status));
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


If you rerun the listStatus request on the directory '/A/B', you could not get the result. Because although the path '/A/B' is in the cache, it holds the content with mStatus. And the CachedItem with mDirStatuses has been replaced in the step 3.
