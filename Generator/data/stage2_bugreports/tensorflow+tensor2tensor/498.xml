	<summary>Training on 1.4.1 hangs</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Since the upgrade to 1.4 I trained a few runs and each hung after a few hours.
seems to be a comparable issue related here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/issues/494&gt;#494&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/issues/496&gt;#496&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Anyone with similar problem ?
Just to be clear, it goes up to freezing the machine need a hard reboot.
I trained without any issue on another toolkit (just to check it was not a hard drive / gpu issue)

		on the last run, the last log line was "saving checkpoint" after about 10-12 hours of training.
Not sure for the previous ones, but I think one time was during "restoring checkpoint".
