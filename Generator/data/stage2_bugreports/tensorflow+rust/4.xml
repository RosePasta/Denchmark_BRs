	<summary>libc::memalign not supported on OSX</summary>
	<description>
On OSX libc doesn't support memalign. It does however support posix_memalign but changing the code to use that instead results in a segfault. I probably just don't know how to use it.

		Let me know if that segfaults.  I don't have an OSX instance handy to test with.

		Thank you so much, that seems to work. I can run the tests and there's no segfault. üëç
