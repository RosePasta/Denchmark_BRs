	<summary>C API stability statement in docs</summary>
	<description>
The README states

Notice: This project is still under active development and not guaranteed to have a stable API. This is especially true because the underlying TensorFlow C API has not yet been stabilized as well.

but the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/versions&gt;tensorflow version compatibility page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 states that the C API is part of the public API, and is therefore

backwards compatible across minor and patch versions

Is the README correct?

		It is true that the C API was not within the project's stability guarantees a few years ago. I suppose this has changed with time.

		I'd be really interested to know what the stability guarantees of the rust API are given this change of circumstances

		The README is out of date about the C bindings.  I'll fix that.
The Rust bindings have been pretty stable in practice, but there are still major additions to make (e.g. stabilizing building models in Rust), and I don't want to announce the project as stable until at least that is done.
