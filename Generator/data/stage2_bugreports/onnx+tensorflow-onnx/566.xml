	<summary>converted GRU op has activation "sigmoid"</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
Seems models in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/blob/master/tests/test_gru.py&gt;https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/blob/master/tests/test_gru.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 converted by tf-onnx will have activations like  "", "Tanh", "sigmoid", "Tanh", since
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/blob/master/tf2onnx/rewriter/gru_rewriter.py#L123&gt;https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/blob/master/tf2onnx/rewriter/gru_rewriter.py#L123&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Just wondering why it's "sigmoid", not "Sigmoid" as showed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#GRU&gt;https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#GRU&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks!

		It should be Sigmoid rather than sigmoid according to onnx specification.
Using sigmoid doesn't cause problems in onnxruntime, as it's not case sensitive, but may screw up in other backends.
We will fix it in later version. Thanks for calling attention to our mistake.
