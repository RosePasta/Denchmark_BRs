	<summary>babel-polyfill in dist file leaks to global space</summary>
	<description>
If you're in a webpack/rollup/etc environment and you require ml5 from there, if you do
var ml5 = require('ml5')
var otherModule = require('module-that-transitively-requires-ml5')
You'll run into an error that
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error: only one instance of babel-polyfill is allowed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This will also happen if your application uses babel-polyfill and you require ml5. Ideally I think there's a way that ml5 can have babel-polyfill for itself while keeping those polyfills just inside of its bundle, so that there's no chance of a conflict.
