	<summary>SketchRNN broken in 0.2.2</summary>
	<description>
This is most likely due to updated version of magenta or tf.js? Although in theory I tried to force an old version of magenta with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library/pull/328&gt;#328&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  Maybe it's tied to the tf.js-core version?
Ultimately a better solution is to just fix it to work with the latest tfjs and magenta!
This is the error I'm getting when running the example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: ee(...).nextTensorId is not a function
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we can fix this we can do a 0.2.3 release!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shiffman&gt;@shiffman&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! I went and checked and my version is working with the latest release  - it seems that when we built the latest version we needed to  before our build since we hadn't done so before + we made changes to the dependencies. Eek!

		This might also be a concern for later - in case the dependency changes breaks some other models.

		Oh, great! I'll file a new issue to upgrade to most recent tf.js as a dependency and maybe we can make that goal for then next release sometime mid April?
Maybe let's plan for a quick 0.2.3 to get SketchRNN working for next Friday and any other big errors that come up that maybe we missed?
