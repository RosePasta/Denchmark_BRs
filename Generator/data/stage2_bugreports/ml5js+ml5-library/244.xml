	<summary>Add support for PoseNet `.singlePose()` &amp; `.multiPose()` callback</summary>
	<description>
Hello!
Related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/pull/79&gt;ml5js/ml5-examples#79&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in using callbacks to structure the js.
In trying to run the PoseNet .singlePose() function using a callback, it doesn't seem to run the callback function. e.g.:
poseNet.singlePose(img, function(err, res) {
        if(err) return err
        // when we get a response, store the results to our poses[] array
        // then draw will do it's thing
        console.log(res)
        poses = res;
    });
However, when using promises, we get the expected results:
poseNet.singlePose(img).then( (res) =&gt; {
        // when we get a response, store the results to our poses[] array
        // then draw will do it's thing
        poses = res;
    }).catch( (err) =&gt; {
        return err;
    });
Could this be an issue with ML5 or with TFJS core?
Below are the images of the differing results:

Hope this helps. Thanks!

		I used the new GitHub beta feature to move the issue here, I think this is something to fix / look at in the library then we can update the example! &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/oveddan&gt;@oveddan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you take a look?

		PoseNet works as an EventEmitter. So you will need to listen to the pose event.
This should work:
// Create the model without a video element
poseNet = ml5.poseNet(modelReady);

// This sets up an event that listens to 'pose' events
poseNet.on('pose', function (results) {
   poses = results;
});

poseNet.singlePose(img)

 Ah! Interesting. Should I update &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/pull/79#issuecomment-442969484&gt;ml5js/ml5-examples#79 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the suggestion above + submit a new PR? Thanks a bunch for the feedback!

 cool! Will do. I'll make sure any of the next submissions also follow the same style. Many thanks !

		This can be closed, however, I wonder if supporting callbacks for these "single use" functions would be helpful in the cases where it's not continuously being run on a webcam?

 If I understand how the poseNet event listener works is that regardless if you're streaming images or not, poseNet is just waiting for some kind of detection to come in. My first instinct would be to use callbacks or a promise (as in the first PR) so if it is not crazy effort to add this, then maybe it's good for consistency with the other image detection methods? Otherwise, using the poseNet event listener is also fine I think if we can point to these examples.

		Yes, I was thinking that for an example where you are maybe loading an array of images it might be tricky to pair the pose data with the correct image if the event listener function is separate?

		<comment id='9' author='joeyklee' date='2018-12-04T18:30:36Z'>
		Having a callback as an options should be straightforward to implement and makes sense. I guess the initial idea of using poseNet in ml5 was more focused on video/interactive but we should support single images.

 - I'd be happy to look into this (unless someone else wants to jump in first). Maybe in the next couple weeks I'll try to cross this off this list :) It'll be a nice opportunity to look into the ml5 lib! Thanks!
