	<summary>Style transfer on Frame Buffer Object ?</summary>
	<description>
Hello everyone,
I've played with the style transfer examples and they are pretty fun, thanks for making this accessible !
One thing I would like to do is do some style transfer on a frame buffer object : something like a &lt;denchmark-link:https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createGraphics&gt;createGraphics&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from p5js in which I could build some abstract graphics and see how it goes.
Do you think thinks it is do-able ?
I've looked at the style transfer class it looks deeply entangled with the use of a video element and I would like to be able to use with any king of p5js image / offscreen buffer. I think it would be better to build a whole other class.
Any thoughts on that idea ?

		Yes, we would like to support this! Are you sure it doesn't work? Have you tried applying it to a canvas image? I believe this is already supported but obviously could be wrong here!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shiffman&gt;@shiffman&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
Sorry for the delay, I've posted a little example that doesn't work here : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/b2renger/ml5-experiments/tree/master/Styletransfer_from_Pgraphics&gt;https://github.com/b2renger/ml5-experiments/tree/master/Styletransfer_from_Pgraphics&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ah, please update your ml5 version in index.html! It should be 0.2.3 now. Note you will also need to use lowercase ml5.styleTransfer() and you should also be able to load the model in preload() which will simplify things!

		Made the changes but I still get the same error.
Btw a live version is available here if you want to check : &lt;denchmark-link:https://b2renger.github.io/ml5-experiments/Styletransfer_from_Pgraphics/&gt;https://b2renger.github.io/ml5-experiments/Styletransfer_from_Pgraphics/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I log the result I get "undefined" and the error below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tf-core.esm.js:17 Uncaught (in promise) Error: pixels passed to tf.fromPixels() can not be null

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/b2renger&gt;@b2renger&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
!
If you don't mind giving this a try with the latest version of ml5 - we're at 0.4.3 now. Style transfer seems to have some issues in firefox, so maybe also testing in Chrome will help.
If this is still an issue, please feel free to add any comments! Thanks!

 thanks for the ping,
I bumped all the versions

ml5 to 0.4.3
-p5js to 0.10.2

But I still do get the same results on chrome or firefox.
It seems that passing a "createGraphics()" object to the ".transfer()" function doesn't work, as tensorflow can't locate the pixel array

		I made a quick sketch that demonstrates how you could do this with the current version of ml5 even though I do think this should be implemented in the library itself.
Normal sketch: &lt;denchmark-link:https://editor.p5js.org/EmmaG/sketches/J8PrwLoiu&gt;https://editor.p5js.org/EmmaG/sketches/J8PrwLoiu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Edit: I forgot to say that this is a direct fix of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/b2renger&gt;@b2renger&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's question.
