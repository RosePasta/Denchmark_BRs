	<summary>neuralNetwork not loading locally generated model files</summary>
	<description>
Dear ml5 community,
I'm submitting a new issue. Please see the details below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;‚Üí Step 1: Describe the issue üìù&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Did you find a bug? Want to suggest an idea for feature?

Trying to load the  three files generated  by neuralNetwork.save() (model.json, model_meta.json and model.weights.bin) using the neuralNetwork.load('model.json', modelReady); does not work. The callback function is never called, model is never loaded.
Notice that the example at
&lt;denchmark-link:https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/NeuralNetwork_load_model&gt;https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/NeuralNetwork_load_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

works perfectly and loads its model correctly.
If you, however, you add the line neuralNetwork.save() in the example at &lt;denchmark-link:https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/NeuralNetwork_color_classifier&gt;https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/NeuralNetwork_color_classifier&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and then upload them to the workspace of the following script and try to load them in this example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/NeuralNetwork_load_model&gt;https://editor.p5js.org/ml5/sketches/NeuralNetwork_load_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The files are not read and callback is never called from neuralNetwork.load('model.json', modelReady)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;‚Üí Step 2: Screenshots or Relevant Documentation üñº&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Here's some helpful screenshots and/or documentation of the new feature
See below.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;‚Üí Step 3: Share an example of the issue ü¶Ñ&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Here's some example code or a demonstration of my feature in this issue, separe GitHub repo, or in the https://editor.p5js.org or codepen/jsfiddle/Glitch/etc...

&lt;denchmark-link:https://editor.p5js.org/jarauz/sketches/9CNGge6d&gt;https://editor.p5js.org/jarauz/sketches/9CNGge6d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
_
Notice that when you click Load Data and then optionally, Plot Data, you can train the model and then save it with Save Model. However, after uploading the generated model files and trying to upload them the load model function does not work.
Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jarauz&gt;@jarauz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - thanks for bringing this to our attention. This is definitely strange. I'll take a look and see if I can track down the source of error.

		Thanks the editor above is leaving the last _ out of the link, if you check the sketch I posted by copy pasting the link with the _ (&lt;denchmark-link:https://editor.p5js.org/jarauz/sketches/9CNGge6d&gt;https://editor.p5js.org/jarauz/sketches/9CNGge6d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
_ ) you can see the behavior I'm describing. Thanks.

		Noticed the same bug when loading the model with the latest ml5.js v0.5.0,  Model loads correctly with 0.4.3, are there any major changes in API, seems like addData, Load Model both are failing with the model saved with the previous version of the ML5.
My production code is heavily affected please investigate this issue.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jarauz&gt;@jarauz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - Thank you for providing this example.
One note that is in the p5 web editor, loading of models requires explicitly setting the paths to the model files:
function bringModel() {
  console.log('Loading model...');
  nn.load({
    model: 'model/model.json',
    metadata: 'model/model_meta.json',
    weights: 'model/model.weights.bin'
  }, modelReady);
}
The reason for this is that the p5 web editor handles links to data in a special way. Each path to each file is actually a URL to a static file server so there's not actually a file system available to you in the web editor. By explicitly specifying each path, it allows ml5 to resolve the actual links to those files.
Maybe give this a try to see if this resolves your issue?

		Joey. Thanks, that solved the issue. I don't know how I missed that
(embarrased here), thanks for taking a look at it.
