	<summary>Error when trying to use BodyPix in WEBGL mode</summary>
	<description>
Dear ml5 community,
I'm submitting a new issue. Please see the details below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;‚Üí Step 1: Describe the issue üìù&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'd like to use shaders in p5js in combination with ml5js's BodyPix algorithm. To use the shaders, I need to set the renderer of the canvas and all graphics to WEBGL. When I do this, ml5 gives me the following error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;‚Üí Step 2: Screenshots or Relevant Documentation üñº&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: this._renderer.image is not a function
    at s.Graphics.x.image (p5.min.js:3)
    at gotResults (sketch.js:49)
    at ml5.min.js:56
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;‚Üí Step 3: Share an example of the issue ü¶Ñ&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Here's my entire sketch.js (it is the only script I'm using besides the shaders.)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;let canvas, pg
let bodypix
let video
let segmentation
let img
let blurShader

const options = {
	"outputStride": 8, // 8, 16, or 32, default is 16
	"segmentationThreshold": 0.3 // 0 - 1, defaults to 0.5 
}

function preload()
{
	blurShader = loadShader( 'shader/effect.vert', 'shader/effect.frag' )
}

function setup()
{
	canvas = createCanvas( windowWidth, windowHeight, WEBGL )
	pg = createGraphics( width, height, WEBGL )
	video = createVideo( 'assets/video.mp4' )
	video.size( width, height )
	video.volume( 0 )
	video.hide()
	bodypix = ml5.bodyPix( video, modelReady )

	noStroke()
}

function modelReady()
{
	console.log( 'ready!' )
	bodypix.segment( gotResults, options )
}

function gotResults( err, result )
{
	if (err)
	{
		console.log(err)
		return
	}

	shader( blurShader )
	segmentation = result

	pg.background( 0 )
	pg.image( video, 0, 0, width, height )
	pg.image( segmentation.maskBackground, 0, 0, width, height )
	image( pg, 0, 0, width, height )

	bodypix.segment( gotResults, options )
}

function mousePressed()
{
	video.loop()
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other relevant information, if applicable
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;‚Üí Describe your setup ü¶Ñ&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 - thanks for posting this issue. I'm not super familiar with p5's webgl mode but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AidanNelson&gt;@AidanNelson&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 might know what's up here.

 - if p5 is available BodyPix returns a p5 Image element. Might you have a hunch at why this might be crashing?

 What version of p5.js are you using?   was only &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/3634&gt;implemented&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in p5.js'  WEBGL mode &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/processing/p5.js/releases&gt;as of v. 0.8.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so perhaps that is the error you are running into?
Seems to be running here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://editor.p5js.org/AidanNelson/sketches/0ZuhkfQOj&gt;https://editor.p5js.org/AidanNelson/sketches/0ZuhkfQOj&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

A couple notes:

Because you're using an essentially 2D function (image) within a 3D WEBGL canvas, you may need to adjust your camera settings to make sure the image is centered in the canvas.  It seems not to be by default.  Alternatively, apply the image as a texture to a plane or box?
You might be able to get away with using a WEBGL offscreen canvas and a 2D main canvas.  In that case, you would need to use pg.shader to apply the shader to your off-screen graphics buffer, I think...
@joeyklee  is it segmentation.maskBackground or segmentation.backgroundMask?  There seems to be some ambiguity between these docs and these older docs?  I think you were looking at an older version of the docs, @samuset.

 - Thanks so much for this reply. I've fixed the docs to reflect the current API which is:
segmentation.backgroundMask
Thanks a bunch for catching this!

@samuset What version of p5.js are you using? image was only implemented in p5.js' WEBGL mode as of v. 0.8.0, so perhaps that is the error you are running into?

A couple notes:
* Because you're using an essentially 2D function (`image`) within a 3D WEBGL canvas, you may need to adjust your [camera settings](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCamera) to make sure the image is centered in the canvas.  It seems not to be by default.  Alternatively, apply the image as a texture to a plane or box?

* You might be able to get away with using a WEBGL offscreen canvas and a 2D main canvas.  In that case, you would need to use `pg.shader` to apply the shader to your off-screen graphics buffer, _I think..._

* @joeyklee  is it `segmentation.maskBackground` or `segmentation.backgroundMask`?  There seems to be some ambiguity between these [docs](https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/reference/bodypix) and [these older docs](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-BodyPix/)?  I think you were looking at an older version of the docs, @samuset.


I was indeed using an earlier version of p5js and updating it to the latest version solved the problem. Thank you very much!
