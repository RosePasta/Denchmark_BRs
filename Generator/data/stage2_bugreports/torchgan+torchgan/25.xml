	<summary>Trainer can't deal with Losses with kwargs</summary>

We need to modify the _get_argument_maps() function to handle this. We should check if the argument is optional and avoid throwing error in that case.
This should be pretty easy to solve. We just need to pass everything as a keyword argument instead of a positional argument.
