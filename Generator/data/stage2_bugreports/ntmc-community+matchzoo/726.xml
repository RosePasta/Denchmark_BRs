	<summary>Bug in save model</summary>
	<description>
Bug exists when saving the model with the following setting:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model.params['optimizer'] = keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.001)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The callback is :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;evaluate = mz.callbacks.EvaluateAllMetrics(model, x=test_x, y=test_y, batch_size=len(test_x), model_save_path='./.tmpdir/')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		params keys should only be basic data types (string, int), not keras optimizer instances. However, I know how to make this work (by calling keras seriailization helpers). Do you think it's really needed?

Hi, I found this when I tried to use specific learning rate to train my model. Or could you give a better way to specify a customized learning rate with the optimizer while using matchzoo?

If you want a quick solution:

add an additional parameter learning_rate in model.params and modify model.build so it takes that parameter into account
add an additional parameter learning_rate in model.params and add additional logic to read that parameter and compile a loaded model.

A better solution, but takes longer:
Matchzoo handles optimizer serialization differently.
Ultimately it's &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/789&gt;keras's fault&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Maybe they will fix that eventually.

		@presimple found a much better workaround in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NTMC-Community/MatchZoo/pull/735&gt;#735&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I hope things are working well for you now. I’ll go ahead and close this issue, but I’m happy to continue further discussion whenever needed.
