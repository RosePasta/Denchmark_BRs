	<summary>Pair DataGenerator results in array of size (1,)</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the Question&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have prepared my own dataframes for left, right, relation. For left and right there are columns text_{left/right}, length_{left/right}, the index is id_{left/right}. All text is already converted into index and is truncated/padded to length=200. When I use the DataGenerator by dev_generator = mz.DataGenerator( dev_processed, mode='pair', num_dup=1, num_neg=1, batch_size=20 ), it returns error of

Passing list-likes to .loc or [] with any missing label will raise
KeyError in the future, you can use .reindex() as an alternative.


See the documentation here:

left = self._left.loc[relation['id_left'].unique()]

I have tried to print out the shapes and the content. I realized there is (nan, nan) pair from the batch_data_pack from batch_data_pack = self._data_pack[indices]. Maybe it is caused by reset_index? Thank you.

 I walked through the tutorials
 I checked the documentation

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mikelam14&gt;@mikelam14&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you impute/remove the missing value and try again?

		The three dataframes (left, right, relation) has no missing values. Index of left and right, ids in relation are all integers. I group the data by mz.DataPack(relation=rel, left=req, right=adv). However pack.frame() would result in some nans. This affects unpack for sure. I suspect it also affects the reset_index in data_generator. If I change the indices to string, frame() would not work, saying vectors with NAN values cannot be used as index.

		Could you provide a minimum working example that reproduces the bug so I can further investigate? Right now I suspect that you have mismatched indices somewhere but I can't be sure. Try calling pack on your data without feeding indices (id_left, id_right) so pack generates the correct ones for you.

		I hope things are working well for you now. I’ll go ahead and close this issue, but I’m happy to continue further discussion whenever needed.
