	<summary>Evaluation error in Matchpyramid tutorial</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to run the tutorial code of Matchpyramid, however, I encountered an error in the last step, when running:
model.evaluate(pred_x, pred_y, batch_size=5)
it says:
~/software/anaconda2/envs/matchzoo/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/errors_impl.py in exit(self, type_arg, value_arg, traceback_arg)
526             None, None,
527             compat.as_text(c_api.TF_Message(self.status.status)),
--&gt; 528             c_api.TF_GetCode(self.status.status))
529     # Delete the underlying status object from memory otherwise it stays alive
530     # as there is a reference to status from this from the traceback due to
InvalidArgumentError: indices[4,9,39] = [9, 5, 24] does not index into param shape [5,10,40,32]
[[{{node dynamic_pooling_layer_3/GatherNd}} = GatherNd[Tindices=DT_INT32, Tparams=DT_FLOAT, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"](conv2d_6/Relu, _arg_dpool_index_2_0_2)]]
Do you know why?
Thanks,
Meng

		This is a known bug and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pl8787&gt;@pl8787&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is working on it. This occurs only when the  is too small, and setting it to  is a workaround.
