	<summary>Multiclass Classification Tabular crashes most models when only two classes are present after thresholding</summary>
	<description>
Fix: Convert to binary classification internally and convert back to multiclass output for the user. This should be done inside Learner.
This only happens on very small datasets or subsampled datasets, and generally won't be an issue on real datasets. Still, we should fix this soon to avoid confusion.
