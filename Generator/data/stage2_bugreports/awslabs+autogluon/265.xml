	<summary>evaluate function issue of the Image Classification - Quick Start tutorial</summary>
	<description>
the evaluate result seems incorrect.
Top-1 test acc: nan
I have tried on my pc. it shows similar messages as the tutorial and return the wrong evaluate result too
"UserWarning: Ignoring data/test/BabyPants of type . Only support .jpg, .jpeg, .png"
is it a bug of getting class names or listing the images? or is there changes about dataset and/or evaluate function?
Thank you
