		I think this is related:
If I ctrl+C in python, even after task.fit() has returned, then I get error when trying to do anything with results object returned by task.fit:
distributed.client - ERROR - Failed to reconnect to scheduler after 10.00 seconds, closing client
Why is dask / the scheduler even needed anymore after task.fit() has returned?
Ideally we would have graceful behavior with ctrl+c during task.fit(), but at the very least, the user should be able to use ctrl+c after task.fit has returned without nasty repercussions.
Shouldn't we shutdown dask/distributed at the very end of task.fit(), so we are just running single-threaded Python once again after task.fit() returns?
For example, if I try to call task.fit() again (in the same python session after a ctrl+C), I get error:

		Yes. Ctrl+c will interupt the backend. We have to restart.

		We can say it's not ok to do Ctrl+C during task.fit().  But why can the user still not use Ctrl+C after task.fit() has returned?  This is a bit weird to me.  Shouldn't all the dask/distributed setup/shutdown take place inside task.fit?  So outside of task.fit, shouldn't python just be running as usual (single-threaded)?
