 Can you take a look at this and see if there are any issues with the 0.0.7 pypi?

		Thanks for notifying! I reproduced the error on a fresh linux machine. Looking into this now, I suspect it was due to how the PyPi was created.

		This is a major defect. Do not install autogluon 0.0.7, as it will fail to import. For the time being, use pip install autogluon==0.0.6 while we work to resolve the issue.

		autogluon 0.0.7 has been yanked from PyPi, we will release 0.0.8 shortly as a hotfix: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon/pull/457&gt;#457&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 has been merged and we have released AutoGluon 0.0.8 which addresses the issue. Please use AutoGluon 0.0.8 and avoid using AutoGluon 0.0.7
Best,
