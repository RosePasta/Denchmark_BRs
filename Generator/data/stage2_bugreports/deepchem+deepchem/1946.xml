	<summary>Docs Build is Broken</summary>
	<description>
It looks like something about the latest build has stopped docs from rendering the docstrings. For example, &lt;denchmark-link:https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transformers.html&gt;https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transformers.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 doesn't have any class doc strings. I'm not sure yet what's happening here but will take a look.

		Looking at the readthedocs build output (&lt;denchmark-link:https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/build/11377758.txt&gt;https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/build/11377758.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), it looks like this is a  issue. I'm seeing warnings of the form
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING: autodoc: failed to import class 'feat.ElementPropertyFingerprint' from module 'deepchem'; the following exception was raised:
cannot import name 'CloudPickler' from 'cloudpickle.cloudpickle' (/home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/deepchem/envs/latest/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cloudpickle/cloudpickle.py)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		The 'CloudPickler' from 'cloudpickle.cloudpickle' error is the same one I was seeing. In the latest version of cloudpickle they changed the import to CloudPickler from cloudpickle. Maybe the CloudPickle update broke Sphinx as well?

		I think the issue is we need to pin the cloud pickle version in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/docs/requirements.txt&gt;https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/docs/requirements.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. This is the file sphinx uses to install deepchem dependencies. Let me put up a PR...

		Ok, looks like docs are back up! Pinning the version did the trick. Going to go ahead and close this issue.
