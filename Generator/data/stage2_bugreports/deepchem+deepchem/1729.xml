	<summary>model.save() raises an error NotImplemented</summary>
	<description>
Hi,

DeepChem Version: 2.3.0

I am starting to use DeepChem, after 1 year break, and I am trying to run some old scripts of mine from dc 2.1, in the current dc 2.3.0 version. Specifically, I am trying to run a model=dc.models.MultitaskClassifier model, but when the script tries to model.save():
error NotImplemented
In the 'old' version, model.save created a 'model.pickle' file, which could be checked for if a model was present in a certain folder, before model.load_from_dir(model_dir). In dc 2.30, the folder only contains checkpoint files
Thanks for any help...

		Interesting, this could be a bug in the latest release. I'm going to mark this as a bug and see if I can reproduce. I'm doing a lot of general DeepChem planning so might take me a bit to get to this.

 Do you have any thoughts in the meanwhile?

 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/issues/1710&gt;#1710&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but not solved either ....

		It's not a bug: the save() method just doesn't exist anymore.  In early versions of DeepChem you had to call save() on your model to save the fitted parameters.  But for a long time now it has automatically saved parameters while fitting, so you can just remove that line.

		Ah good point! &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JZuegg&gt;@JZuegg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'm going to close this issue since it's not a bug, but feel free to re-open if necessary.
