		Hi,
Did you run into the error while trying to run the protein_ligand_complex example notebook?

		Yes,I run into the error while trying to run the protein_ligand_complex example notebook.

 I think this might an indentation error in def load_pdbbind_grid from ~/anaconda3/lib/site-packages/deepchem/molnet/load_function/pdbbind_datasets.py
(..)
if reload:
deepchem.utils.save.save_dataset_to_disk(save_dir, train, valid, test,
transformers)
return tasks, (train, valid, test), transformers.

The above return statement is not executed if passing featurizer='grid'.
very thankful!

		Did you install from source or use the conda version?
Because I have it installed from source, and had recently fixed some indentation errors there and didn't have any issues running the notebook, before pushing it

		That explains it.
You can either install from source, to get a working notebook, or else could wait for the new version of DeepChem to be released.
