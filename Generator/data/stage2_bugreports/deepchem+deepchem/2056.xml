	<summary>DiskDataset.shuffle_each_shard broken</summary>
	<description>
The implementation for  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/deepchem/data/datasets.py#L1649-L1662&gt;https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/deepchem/data/datasets.py#L1649-L1662&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) is broken. The issue is in line &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/deepchem/data/datasets.py#L1662&gt;https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/deepchem/data/datasets.py#L1662&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where shuffled shards are all written to the same file and overwrite one another. I think we don't have a proper unit test for this either or we would have caught this issue.
We also need improved logging (in general for DiskDataset, I think a good logging strategy is 1 logging output per new shard. If shards are reasonably sized, this provides good logging coverage without spam)
