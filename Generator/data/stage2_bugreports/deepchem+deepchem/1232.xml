I think that the indentation of line 104 in deepchem/contrib/mpnn/mpnn.py is wrong..
it's indentation level should be one below
isn't it?

 I think you are correct.  The code in contrib is held to a lower standard than the code in the rest of the repo.  A PR to fix this issue would be much appreciated!
