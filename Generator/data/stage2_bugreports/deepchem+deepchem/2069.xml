Tutorial part 16 needs updating.
This is error I get when running on the newest version of DeepChem.

		Ah you're right! We need to clean this up in an update pass of the tutorials

		This tutorial needs to be updated to work with the most recent DeepChem

		Would also be nice to see something more chemistry relevant. Hence my question on gitter regarding graph to molecule conversion.

		We're in the middle of doing a complete pass through all the tutorials, fixing them up.  See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/issues/2112&gt;#2112&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  This issue was already fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/pull/2116&gt;#2116&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so I'm going to close it.
