	<summary>Unable to search in Docs</summary>
	<description>
Unable to search in the DeepChem. Any search like conv2D, maxPool, data loader returns NULL.
I suspect that the search returns NULL for all the keywords (but am not sure). This might be due to the version of Sphinx - we are currently using 1.3.5 and the latest version is 1.7.6.
In any case this shouldn't be problem since search was working previously. I guess the root cause is something else.

		I'm moving the docs over to readthedocs which has search functionality.
