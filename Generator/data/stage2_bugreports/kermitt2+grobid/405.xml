	<summary>pdf.js misconfigured on docker image ?</summary>
	<description>
Using the web service and going to PDF I see on the browser console
GET https://grobid.atypon.com/resources/pdf.js/build/pdf.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404
This is reasonable since the whole resources folder is missing
root@grobid-84cbcddb44-4ns4b:/opt/grobid# ls /opt/grobid/grobid-home/ config	language-detection  lexicon  lib  models  pdf2xml  schemas  tmp
and
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;root@grobid-84cbcddb44-4ns4b:/opt/grobid# cat grobid-home/config/grobid.properties
...
##-------------------- start: directories ---------------------
# properties of where to find directories necessary for Grobid
# EACH KEY REFERENCING A PATH HAS TO ENDS WITH ".path"
grobid.resource.path=./resources
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Out of curiosity, I added pdf.js from mozilla and created the folder structure, that error disappeared but a new popped
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;grobid.js:342 Uncaught ReferenceError: PDFJS is not defined
    at FileReader.reader.onloadend (grobid.js:342)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Moreover, when I do such request, the pod (container) restarts promptly with something like this on the logs
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;...

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I see that this whole process works on the demo site &lt;denchmark-link:http://cloud.science-miner.com/grobid/&gt;http://cloud.science-miner.com/grobid/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you please explain what I am missing? I am tasked to deploy grobid so I don't know much of its functionality

 sorry I missed your issue. I try to have a look this week.
Which version are you using from docker?

		"Docker version 18.09.2", "18.06.1-ce"
I am not sure it has to do with the version.
I created my own Dockerfile based on yours and it works fine I think.
The difference is that i clone your repo inside the builder instead of copying folders.

		Nothing, sorry I was taking about the grobid version
		</comment>
		<comment id='4' author='hdimitriou' date='2019-03-12T09:59:58Z'>
		0.5.4 version of Grobid

		<comment id='5' author='hdimitriou' date='2019-03-12T13:10:33Z'>
		I used to clone the repo but we have changed that afterwards so that it was possible to create the docker version of the actual version that was checked out.

		Ok it's actually a bug not in the docker but in how the grobid-service jar is built... the sub-directory of pdf.js is called build which is a very unfortunate name cause gradle is likely to ignore it.
The issue should be fixed in the 0.5.4-fixes branch, but testing it is a pain... so might not be able to finish today.

		OK the issue is solved after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/commit/41fd74e034ee48461e5a881fc2d3b1347aec6a48&gt;41fd74e&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (I'm pushing the new image, might thake the whole day to upload  )

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hdimitriou&gt;@hdimitriou&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you please test it and close the ticket, if the problem is solved? Thank you!

		It works fine now, I tested the new image.
It would be wise if you could tag it with another tag, because anyone who has already downloaded it might not download it again
