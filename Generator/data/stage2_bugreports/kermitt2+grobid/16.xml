	<summary>Abstract has no space between words</summary>
	<description>
When processHeader'ing some pdfs, I get an abstract with all words concatenated without spaces between them.
For instance:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://guillaumemuller1.free.fr/Articles/iTrust2006_LNAI.pdf&gt;http://guillaumemuller1.free.fr/Articles/iTrust2006_LNAI.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But not with:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://search.arxiv.org:8081/paper.jsp?r=1306.4727&amp;qid=1375964777082mix_nCnN_-1091422823&amp;qs=1306.4727&gt;http://search.arxiv.org:8081/paper.jsp?r=1306.4727&amp;qid=1375964777082mix_nCnN_-1091422823&amp;qs=1306.4727&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, pdftoxml ran in commandline separates the words (TOKENs) correctly.

		During the synchronisation between labeled tokens and the tokens coming from the PDF problems, special characters present in the PDF could result in this lack of space between tokens. Additional checks have been introduced to avoid that.
