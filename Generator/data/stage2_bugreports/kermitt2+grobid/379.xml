	<summary>Consolidation for citation string parameters sent from the GUI</summary>
	<description>
It seems that the wrong parameters are being sent on the interface

		Thanks! The parameter consolidateCitations works fine, it's just that a useless parameter consolidateHeader is always present, due to weak javascript... it will be ignored by the service and has no impact. I will clean it in the GUI!

		Actually all the queries are ajaxForm sharing the same form to simplify the javascript. Only the relevant consolidation options are visible given the selected service. Then non visible extra-parameters are also sent, but as they are not relevant, they will be ignored by the service. I am not sure it is really useful to "complexify" the javascript with one form per service.
