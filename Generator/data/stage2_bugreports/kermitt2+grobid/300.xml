	<summary>Unable to disabe Crossref consolidation via consolidateHeader</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to disable the Crossref consolidation.
The UI has a tick box to disable it, but it doesn't seem to have an affect. I don't see the flag in the network request. (Both locally as well as on the demo site)
According to the docs, there is the consolidateHeader flag. It looks like it is a form parameter.
curl -v --form input=@./thefile.pdf --form consolidateHeader=0 http://localhost:8070/api/processHeaderDocument
That doesn't seem to have the desired effect.
It could be that it's related to this if condition that seem to ignore the flag it found the DOI:



grobid/grobid-core/src/main/java/org/grobid/core/engines/HeaderParser.java


         Line 267
      in
      2d3e11e






 if (consolidate || (resHeader.getDOI() != null)) { 





(The document has indeed a DOI and I can see the request being made for the DOI)
Test document:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/26/287888.full.pdf&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/26/287888.full.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In that PDF, author first names are abbreviated - with consolidateHeader=0 I am expecting the XML to contain the names as per PDF. Just to show that it's not hidden somewhere, disabling access to Crossref does produce the desired result.

 I'm discussing with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/de-code&gt;@de-code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I'm also wondering that if the consolidation is set to false, it should not be attempted, even if there is a DOI. What's the reason behind it?
Thanks
