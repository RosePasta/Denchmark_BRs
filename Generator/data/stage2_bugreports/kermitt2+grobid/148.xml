	<summary>Pdf annotation doesn't notify in case of errors</summary>
	<description>
When the PDF annotation fails, the page keep showing "Request server...". Seems a problem in the javascript.
To reproduce the problem:

select tab PDF and then Add layer to PDF
select the following PDF
the "Request server..." remains independently from the fact that the request had failed with error 500 (see screenshot)

		Seems there is a regression with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/commit/4a64a2e84031f6aa577256d082323853ce6a0833&gt;4a64a2e&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (see changes in grobid.js)
When the document is valid, there is still a 'request to server' information:

When the document is invalid, nothing happear:

		The other service seems working fine. The 'request to server' is behaving correctly. I don't know in case of error, as I don't have a pdf that fails for that one.
