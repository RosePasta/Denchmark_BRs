	<summary>Length check fails for IterableDataset</summary>
	<description>
I am using IterableDataset with unknown length. It fails inside the following if clause:



ignite/ignite/engine/engine.py


         Line 642
      in
      cc78b3b






 if hasattr(data, "__len__"): 





Here is the logic why it fails:

Data is PyTorch DataLoader, which has the __len__ attr, so it goes into the if clause
It runs the code epoch_length = len(data), and leads to length = self._IterableDataset_len_called = len(self.dataset) in dataloader.py in pytorch
Since dataset is an IterableDataset, it doesn't have length so it throws sth like TypeError: object of type 'IterableDataset' has no len()

My concern is that we shouldn't expect IterableDataset to have __len__ and the code should not fail because of it. Any thoughts on this?

 thanks for the report! Yes, you are right about that. We have a test with  but with defined : 
 Yes, definitely, we need to support  with unknown length !
