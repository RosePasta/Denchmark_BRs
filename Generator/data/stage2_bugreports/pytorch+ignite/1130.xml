	<summary>Auto dataloader - ValueError: batch_size should be a positive integer value, but got batch_size=0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following code will brake if batch_size is smaller than world size :
import torch
import ignite.distributed as idist

def foo(i):
    data = torch.arange(100).reshape(25, 4)
    data_loader = idist.auto_dataloader(data, batch_size=6, num_workers=12)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    idist.spawn("gloo", foo, args=(), nproc_per_node=8)    
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: batch_size should be a positive integer value, but got batch_size=0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

A fix can be:

keep batch size as provided if smaller than world size
same for num_workers

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.4): 1.5.0
Ignite Version (e.g., 0.3.0): master

 thanks! I'd say sooner is better. Let's say to have it done before this friday. Anyway, no worries about if you haven't time for that. If it becomes urgent, we'll do it :)

		I think I know the source of the bug, the world_size in this example is 8, but batch_size is 6, so ignite/distributed/auto.py:L68 makes it 0.

A fix cant be:

 I'm not sure if this is a typo or not

 yes, you are correct about that: 6 // 8 = 0

And yes, it is a typo. I fixed it.
