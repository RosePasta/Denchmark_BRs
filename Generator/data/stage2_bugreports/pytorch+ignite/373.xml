	<summary>Issue with traced models</summary>
	<description>
If user passes a traced model into create_supervised* methods and specifies a device, there will be the following error:
traced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, z)

evaluator = create_supervised_evaluator(traced_model, metrics, device='cuda')
&gt; RuntimeError: to is not supported on TracedModules
We need to check if model have the method .to...

		Probably, we should wait until &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/6008&gt;this issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is done.
EDIT: pytorch/pytorch#15340

		As  has been merged,  methods will work on ScriptModule and traced models.
We need to checked with tests on CI ...

 if you would like to contribute, you can add a test with traced and scripted models passing to  method with device  and the test should pass for pytorch-nightly build (can be check with )

the test should pass for pytorch-nightly build (can be check with torch.version)

Do you mean only executing the test if on the nightly, or check if it throws a RuntimeError if not on the nightly?

 you can do it like this:
# Check if torch-nightly
if "dev" in torch.__version__:
     ...
else:
