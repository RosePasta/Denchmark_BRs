	<summary>Fix CI : bug with python 2.7 opengym</summary>
	<description>
Currently, CI is &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.org/pytorch/ignite/builds/490068197&gt;broken&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, smoke tests of RL examples fail using opengym. Need to investigate.

 looked into this, this is an issue with the super call in discrete.py
This was recently fixed on the master branch using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openai/gym/pull/1312&gt;this PR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I built gym from the master branch and the tests in travis.yml passed.
One option is to ignore the test and wait till a new release is cut, or we can just build from master. Thoughts?

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/anmolsjoshi&gt;@anmolsjoshi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, maybe we can set now the version of opengym to the previous stable one and once the bug is fixed, remove the version fix.
