	<summary>[DOCS] Rendered class and method signature overlaps with [source] after sphinx update</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've noticed that after updating to sphinx=3.1, documentation has some problem with class header layout, if you go to the docs webpage, you can find that in some cases type hits overlap with [SOURCE] button, in some cases even definition overlaps as well. Zooming-in/out doesn't help.
Here is what I get:

After roll back to old version everything works fine, Also, I've noticed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/0da6730f029863b3c812e05ddb3cec8a316c7c1c/docs/requirements.txt#L1&gt;pytorch repo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that they're using , I've tried that version and it works well too.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 thanks for the report, yes, I noticed that too but I thought that it was due to newly introduced type annotations.

After roll back to old version everything works fine

Does it mean, you have you tested current master branch with sphinx==1.8.5 ?
If yes, maybe we can try the latest version of sphinx == 3.2.1 and check if it was fixed ?

		Nope all new versions after  do not produce the right results, same problem. I've also find this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/36065&gt;Pin Sphinx to 2.4.4 &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, they also pinned to  version, looks like pytorch theme has some troubles with newer sphinx.

 thanks for details, seems like we have no choice here. However, we wanted to update to 3.1 due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/issues/1273&gt;#1273&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
I think we have to downgrade to 2.4.4 and try to autogenerate toc tree somehow differently.
If you guys have other ideas, we are open for that :)

  I agree with you, we need to downgrade, since for "autotoc" there is alternative solution from SO + we can do it manually (as always :) But I didn't find any solution for that weird header layout.
