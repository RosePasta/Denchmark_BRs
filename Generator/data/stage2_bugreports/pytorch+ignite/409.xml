	<summary>Bug in recursive attach of MetricsLambda</summary>
	<description>
As a result of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/pull/385&gt;#385&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the recursive attach of MetricsLambda is not working as intended.
The code below throws this error: NotComputableError: Accuracy must have at least one example before it can be computed.
import torch

from ignite.metrics import Accuracy, Precision, Recall, MetricsLambda
from ignite.engine import Engine

accuracy_1 = Accuracy()
accuracy_2 = Accuracy()
mean_accuracy = (accuracy_1 + accuracy_2) / 2


metrics = {
#     "a1": accuracy_1,
#     "a2": accuracy_2,    
    "mean accuracy": mean_accuracy,
}


y_pred = torch.randint(0, 2, size=(15, 10, 4)).float()
y = torch.randint(0, 2, size=(15, 10, 4)).long()

def update_fn(engine, batch):
    y_pred, y = batch
    return y_pred, y

validator = Engine(update_fn)

for name, metric in metrics.items():
    metric.attach(validator, name)

def data(y_pred, y):
    for i in range(y_pred.shape[0]):
        yield (y_pred[i], y[i])

d = data(y_pred, y)
state = validator.run(d, max_epochs=1)

print(state.metrics)
