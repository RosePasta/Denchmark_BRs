		I had the same issue (Win 10).  What fixed it for me was to comment out two lines of logger code in the /server/graph.py file.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;logger.info("freezing %d variables...", len(returned_variables))

logger.info("Converted %d variables to const ops.", how_many_converted) 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Could you do  and tell me your version? as I already solved the logger issue on Windows in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service/pull/183&gt;#183&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and shouldn't be any problem since 1.7.0.
Please do pip install -U bert-serving-server bert-serving-client and upgrade to the latest version and retry.

		I also have the same issue,

Windows 10
tf version 1.12.0 (conda tensorflow-gpu venv)
Same issue with and without -cpu flag
Python version 3.6.8
bert-serving-start -version gives: 1.7.4, upgraded now to 1.7.5 but the result is the same.

UPDATE: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/davidlenz&gt;@davidlenz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 solution seems to work (tested with GPU)

		Somehow my logger mysteriously fails on Windows for this particular part. I did a quick fix, could you please give a try on 1.7.6 using pip install -U?

		Instead of bumping versions, I'd keep it as it is for now. In the next version, I will remove logger in  for better compatibility on Windows. For all windows users, if you encounter such problem, please refer to the quick fix as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service/issues/207#issuecomment-455890549&gt;#207 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested. Meanwhile stay tuned.
