	<summary>[BUG] val_accuracy as a monitor metric for Experiment class</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The Experiment class does not recognize "val_accuracy" as a valid value for monitor_metric, while the doc implies that both acc and accuracy should be supported.
To Reproduce
Instantiate an Experiment, passing "val_accuracy" as value for the monitor_metric parameter
Expected behavior
The Experiment should accept the value and track validation accuracy to determine the best model, as it does when the value "val_acc" is passed.

		The monitor metric has to be a key in the log dictionnary passed to callbacks. Maybe we should specify that in the doc?

		Hi, since version 1.0, I updated the documentation about metrics. Let me know if you think there are some things not clear. I will close this issue.
