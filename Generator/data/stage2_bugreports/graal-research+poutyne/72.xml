	<summary>[BUG] Reset EpochMetric is assumed to be handled, which shouldn't</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
EpochMetrics are designed to accumulate statistics for a given Epoch.
Given their interface, there is a method to accumulate and a method to retrieve the said metric.
If one does not explicitly reset the accumulators within the get_metric method, statistics are wrong.
To Reproduce
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;class CorrelationMetric(EpochMetric):
    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__()
        self.scores = list()
        self.distances = list()

    def forward(self, x, y):
        # Accumulate metrics here
        e3 = x['e3']
        scores = x['scores']
        distances = x['distances']
        for i, (s, d) in enumerate(zip(scores, distances)):
            self.scores.append(1 - float(s[e3[i]]))
            self.distances.append(float(d))  # We append the distance

    def get_metric(self):
        val =  np.corrcoef(self.scores, self.distances)[0][1]
        self.reset()  # Forgetting this line is problematic, and people will do!
        return val

    def reset(self) -&gt; None:
        self.scores = list()
        self.distances = list()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
The interface should force to implement the reset method, and IMO the training loop should call it after the end of an epoch, not the get_metric method.

		I've made PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GRAAL-Research/poutyne/pull/73&gt;#73&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if we want to go with this option. However, this is a small breaking change. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/davebulaval&gt;@davebulaval&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 What do you think?

		I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ngarneau&gt;@ngarneau&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is right, it was not explicit that reset should be present in  and it is more clear to call it as suggested.
