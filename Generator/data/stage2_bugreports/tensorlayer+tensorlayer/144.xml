	<summary>Attempt to reuse RNNCell with a different variable scope than its first use</summary>
	<description>
It seems that TensorFlow 1.1 has made some changes to how to use the , please check &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e8482ab23bd0fce5c2941f6a190158bca2610a35&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8191&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#8191&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
For example,the current code inside tl.layers.DynamicRNNLayer only works in TensorFlow 1.0, not in TensorFlow 1.1. It will raise error shown in the title if TensorFlow 1.1 is used.
I changed the source code in tl.layers.DynamicRNNLayer to this, and it works again.
self.cell = MultiRNNCell_fn([self.cell] * n_layer, state_is_tuple=True)
changed to:
self.cell = MultiRNNCell_fn([tf.contrib.rnn.DropoutWrapper(cell_fn(num_units=n_hidden, **cell_init_args), input_keep_prob=in_keep_prob, output_keep_prob=1.0) for _ in range(n_layer)], state_is_tuple=True)
Can you update the RNN code for the latest TensorFlow? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zsdonghao&gt;@zsdonghao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  Thanks.

 Many thanks for your report.
Could you make a push request, because this is your contribution.
To make it works for all version, you may like to change as follow.
try: # TF1.1
     xxx
except:  # TF1.0
     xxx
Thanks in advance.
