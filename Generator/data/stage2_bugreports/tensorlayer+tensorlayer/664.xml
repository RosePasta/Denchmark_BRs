	<summary>AttributeError: 'ConvLSTMLayer' object has no attribute 'initial_state'?</summary>
	<description>
In ConvLSTMLayer, there is a parameter named 'initial_state'.
When initial_state = None, it works.
When initial_state = previous_ConvLSTMLayer.final_state, it reports this error.
I think the source code in ConvLSTMLayer does not handle well the situation when initial_state is not None

		Can you give a simple snippet to reproduce?

		Please fix  your code and keep an appropriate formating.
It is impossible to run your code.

imports are missing
vars are missing
conv2d(...) this is not code
etc.

If you want some help, you need to make sure that we can easily reproduce your problem
Make something simple and minimal that I can execute with python main.py

  I can reproduce the error. Could one of you have a look why it happens ?
It would be nice to fix it before releasing 
Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dengyueyun666&gt;@dengyueyun666&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for this bug report, we are investigating this ;) If you think you can fix, you are more than welcome to submit a PR
