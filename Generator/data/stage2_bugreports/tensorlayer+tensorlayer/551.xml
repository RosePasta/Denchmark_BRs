	<summary>A small problem in the maxPool2D initializer</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We run the code of srgan with tensorflow 0.1.1 and tensorlayer 1.8.5, and we meet an error shown as:
File "/home/deeplearning/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorlayer/layers/pooling.py", line 205, in init
raise Exception("len(strides) should be 2.")
Exception: len(strides) should be 2.
Then we go to the implemention of the pooling.py and find some confusion. The Line 248-249 of pooling.py demonstrated as follows:
if len(strides) == 2:
    raise Exception("len(strides) should be 2.")
Obviously it is invalid. Maybe it should be:
if len(strides) != 2:
    raise Exception("len(strides) should be 2.")

		Tensorflow should be updated to latest version:

pip install --upgrade tensorflow
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

How can you hope it is working a version of TF more than 1 year old and the latest version of TL?
