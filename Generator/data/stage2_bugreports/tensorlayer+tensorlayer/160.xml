	<summary>save_npz sometimes fails</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
 sometimes fails because of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer/blob/master/tensorlayer/files.py#L552&gt;this line of code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, where  is a  of numpy arrays. When the first dimension of arrays in  is the same but other dimensions may be not, numpy would raise a broadcast error.
Here is a piece of code for reproducing the numpy error.

import numpy as np
t1 = np.arange(8).reshape((2, 2, 2))
t2 = np.arange(12).reshape((2, 2, 3))
t3 = np.arange(16).reshape((2, 2, 4))
np.savez('test.npz', params=[t1, t2, t3])

I use python 3.5 and numpy 1.12. I googled around and it seems to be an implementation problem in numpy, as suggested by &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25552741/python-numpy-not-saving-array&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. A possible solution is not to use a list of numpy arrays for the .

		thank you for reporting this.
Could we set all params to list before saving them?
np.savez('test.npz', [list(t1),list(t2),list(t3)])

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zsdonghao&gt;@zsdonghao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the error would still be raised.
