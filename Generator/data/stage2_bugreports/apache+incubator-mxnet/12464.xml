	<summary>nnvm submodule broken in release 1.2.1</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It appears the nnvm (or it's tvm) submodule commit is no longer valid.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone --recursive --single-branch -b 1.2.1 https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet incubator-mxnet
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Results in:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;error: no such remote ref fdba6cc9bd3bec9ccd0592fa3900b7fe25d6cb97
Fetched in submodule path '3rdparty/nnvm/tvm', but it did not contain fdba6cc9bd3bec9ccd0592fa3900b7fe25d6cb97. Direct fetching of that commit failed.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;What have you tried to solve it?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I noticed that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/8e4aeee6f0021d0c5a90fac0bda4631eac03e1cc&gt;8e4aeee&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 looks related to this issue in .
Can we get a similar fix in the 1.2.1 release? I'd like to build the stable version instead of master.

		There was a history rewrite in tvm repo which breaks this.
The commit still exists in my fork &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/tvm&gt;https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/tvm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you add this as the remote and see if you can checkout that commit?

 yes your fork has the commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/tvm/commit/fdba6cc9bd3bec9ccd0592fa3900b7fe25d6cb97&gt;eric-haibin-lin/tvm@fdba6cc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 is the issue still persisting? Could you close the issue if it has been fixed?

 1.2.0 branch was fixed, it tracks new branch of nnvm now. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/commit/0ca68e89ced69c0100aed32343cf30b45cafca7a&gt;dmlc/nnvm@0ca68e8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think we can do same for 1.2.1 branch too, it can track &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/tree/mx_1.2.0&gt;https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/tree/mx_1.2.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 as far as I can tell this issue exists for 1.2.0 as well:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone --recursive --single-branch -b 1.2.0 https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet incubator-mxnet
...
error: no such remote ref fdba6cc9bd3bec9ccd0592fa3900b7fe25d6cb97
Fetched in submodule path '3rdparty/nnvm/tvm', but it did not contain fdba6cc9bd3bec9ccd0592fa3900b7fe25d6cb97. Direct fetching of that commit failed.

 I tried to reproduce the above issue with the command you have mentioned above and noticed that it has been fixed. Could you please close the issue as its not persisting anymore?

 I still see the same error with the same repo case:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone --recursive --single-branch -b 1.2.1 https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet incubator-mxnet
....
error: no such remote ref fdba6cc9bd3bec9ccd0592fa3900b7fe25d6cb97

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Perhaps you did not receive the error if you already had commit fdba6cc9bd3bec9ccd0592fa3900b7fe25d6cb97 in your local remote?
I decent workaround is to just download the release tarball for that version; no problems there.
I've since updated to 1.3.0, so this is no longer an issue for me. I'm closing the issue since (1) there is a workaround and (2) it seems there isn't a lot of need to checkout older versions from git.
