 Seems like this issue has been fixed, here's an example that I ran on the current master:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a = mx.nd.zeros((65540, 2, 2), ctx=mx.gpu(1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; mx.nd.L2Normalization(a, mode='channel')

[[[ 0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.]]

 [[ 0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.]]

 [[ 0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.]]

 ..., 
 [[ 0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.]]

 [[ 0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.]]

 [[ 0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.]]]
&lt;NDArray 65540x2x2 @gpu(1)&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; mx.nd.L2Normalization(a)

[[[ 0.  0.]
  [ 0.  0.]]

&lt;NDArray 65540x2x2 @gpu(1)&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If you have further questions or concerns regarding this operator please feel free to raise that, thanks!

 My apologies about that on behalf of the team! Hope that you're still using MXNet as your DL framework. Your issue should be fixed by some earlier PRs, but we somehow failed to link the improvement to your issue.
