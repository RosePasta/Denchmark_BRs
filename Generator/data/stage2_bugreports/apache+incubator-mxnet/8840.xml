	<summary>[cpp-package] op.h got some error when compile</summary>
	<description>
i got some error when i compile op.h, there are some codes in "op.h" set default value like :
Shape target_shape = [0,0]
and
Shape target_shape = []
after i change the code as following, it works, is this problem cause by the script that generate the op.h ?
Shape target_shape = Shape (0,0)
Shape target_shape = Shape ()
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 Does this issue remain with the current version of mxnet?
