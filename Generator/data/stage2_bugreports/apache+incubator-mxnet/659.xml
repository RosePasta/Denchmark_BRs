	<summary>[Python Symbolic API] failed to use one symbol multiple times in a single op</summary>
	<description>
for example
sym.concat(s1, s1) or s2 = s1 * s1
If I do so, the model can be trained by calling fit() due to the logs I see. But it stopped there and cannot execute the rest of my code.
Of course I can replace s1 * s1 by s1 ** 2, but this is a bug, right?
