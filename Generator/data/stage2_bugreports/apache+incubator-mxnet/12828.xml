	<summary>Navigation for Docs Broken</summary>
	<description>
Often end up in state where documentation navigation is unresponsive.
Works when starting from &lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/index.html&gt;https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but lots of  documentation links take you away from this page, and then the navigation doesn't work.

See https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/optimization/optimization.html.
And try clicking on 'Gluon API'.
Just gives https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/optimization/optimization.html#gluon-api in address bar but doesn't change page.

 was working on this file: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/docs/_static/js/auto_module_index.js&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/docs/_static/js/auto_module_index.js&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And noted a bug in it that can cause the page to go blank if you try to use the  directive in Sphinx.
This js file also injects some stuff on the left nav bar and it seems awfully close to what we're seeing here with this bug. Maybe this clue will help reach a solution to this issue.

 reckon we could just add links to the headers in the markdown ? Since the headers are getting added to the top level of the navigation tree.
So ## Autograd API -&gt; ## [Autograd API](autograd/autograd.md)
Also, for Autograd and Contrib, there's nothing underneath so wonder if we wanted to avoid generating the tree at all, and just use headers?

 That's a great idea - did you try it or are you speculating?
Generation of the tree is automatic, but then tampered with by a variety of client side hacks... so I'm reluctant. Each time I try untangling the mess   in the js, horrible  things happen.

 I tried the replacement described above and found that it didn't have any impact unless the tree generation for Autograd was also removed. However, this presented a new issue as removing the tree generation meant that the autograd.md page no longer had a TOC for navigating to the rest of the content.

		New website launch makes this a moot issue.
