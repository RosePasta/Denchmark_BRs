Please see my reviews there.

The problem is, the transition matrix should be made one of the parameters (can be learned during the train process), rather than be fixed.
I will try to make a PR resently, fix the bug together with a mini-batch version of LSTM-CRF implenmentation.

 : Could you please share more information about what issue you were facing? Minimum reproducible code would be very nice to have.  Or, if you have a PR with suggested changes, please do share.
