	<summary>FindMKL.cmake small bugs</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


cmake/Modules/FindMKL.cmake doesn't search $HOME/intel path, but only /opt/intel. I believe it could search both because if mkl is installed without sudo, it is installed in $HOME/intel.
mklvars.sh exports env variable MKLROOT therefore FindMKL should search in ENV{MKLROOT} instead of ENV{MKL_ROOT} because MKL_ROOT is cmake variable.
Unused cmake variables INTEL_ROOT INTEL_RTL_ROOT should be replaced with MKL_ROOT.

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run cmake after running source ../path/to/mklvars.sh or set environment variable MKLROOT manually and see that it doesn't find MKL properly.
