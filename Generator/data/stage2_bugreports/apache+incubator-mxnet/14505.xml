	<summary>RandomResizedCrop produces wrong aspect ratios.</summary>
	<description>
RandomResizedCrop randomly swaps with/height which produces out-of-bounds aspect ratios if the ends of the aspect ratio range are not reciprocals. When swapping is removed, then the aspect ratio is skewed. The solution is to use uniform distribution on a logarithmic scale. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/vision/pull/799&gt;pytorch/vision#799&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
