	<summary>Build error for OSX with CUDA support</summary>
	<description>
Building MXNet on OSX with CUDA support using the Makefile appears broken. Using bisection search, the build breakages started with commit 0fd29698a11c0c77180aefdcf8264e063158a2c0. Building gives an error:

Config file CUDA flags:

USE_CUDA = 1

# add the path to CUDA library to link and compile flag
# if you have already add them to environment variable, leave it as NONE
USE_CUDA_PATH = /usr/local/cuda
# USE_CUDA_PATH = NONE

# whether to enable CUDA runtime compilation
ENABLE_CUDA_RTC = 1

# whether use CuDNN R3 library
USE_CUDNN = 1

#whether to use NCCL library
USE_NCCL = 0
#add the path to NCCL library
USE_NCCL_PATH = NONE
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm using NVCC:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sbodenstein&gt;@sbodenstein&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for the report.  I've just finished building locally and all seems well for me using the same settings as you on my mac (with CUDA installed).  Would you be able to post a full build log, the full config file used and run:
echo $NVCC
In the terminal you're using?
It'd be great if we could narrow this one down so other users don't get caught by it.

		Attached are my build log and config file. Running echo $NVCC after building returns empty. Its not defined.

		Thanks for the report &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sbodenstein&gt;@sbodenstein&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  I see what the issue is and will open a PR, it should be reasonably easy to fix.
To give some background: I made this change because previously no matter what you specified as your nvcc path, the makefile would use /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc for nvcc.  In your case this was actually a good thing because your config specifies just 'nvcc' which is likely not on your path.  Changing to the absolute path fixes the problem.  However this behaviour causes issues when cross compiling.  You may have an arm and x86 cuda path specified, and you need to select the correct nvcc for your platform.
Thanks again for pointing this out, and for following up with the build log + config.

 Can you test this in master, I think the merged PR above should address your concerns.  If it does feel free to close the issue, and if not let us know.
