I found a bug in the source code, I don't know how to define it, but I commented out that the code will run better.
When I used C++ to call Python's model, a bug about cuda appeared in the c++ forward reasoning process. This bug is similar to:

`[11:25:55] src/nnvm/legacy_json_util.cc:209: Loading symbol saved by previous version v0.8.0. Attempting to upgrade...
[11:25:55] src/nnvm/legacy_json_util.cc:217: Symbol successfully upgraded!
Best Result: pomegranate (id=957, accuracy=0.45423976)
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'dmlc::Error'
what():  [11:26:02] src/common/../common/cuda_utils.h:296: Check failed: e == cudaSuccess || e == cudaErrorCudartUnloading CUDA: invalid device                ordinal

This is just the case with gpuã€‚
I commented out /common/cuda_utils.h: 296 lines and 295 lines. Because I think the author used cudaSetDevice in the destructor, I don't understand it very much and it caused the error I encountered. After commenting out, the program works fine.
  ~DeviceStore() { // if (restore_) //   CUDA_CALL(cudaSetDevice(restore_device_)); }

		I guess what happened was cudaGetDevice was called after the driver started unloading and so it did not populate the restore_device_ properly. I have a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13764&gt;#13764&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that changes the DeviceGuard already, I can fix this problem there.

 looks like folks are trying to help, but without a follow up from your end, and/or a reproduction scenario, it would be hard to help out.
Please let us know whether this still happens, or is it fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ptrendx&gt;@ptrendx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 code change.
Feel free to close if not reproducing. Thanks!

		I think this bug can be closed due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13764&gt;#13764&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and the lack of repro scenario and response from the submitter of the issue (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/l1uw3n&gt;@l1uw3n&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). If closed in error this can be re-opened.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/anirudh2290&gt;@anirudh2290&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please review and unless I am missing anything close?
