	<summary>Seems the gperftools-devel and jemalloc-devel wouldn't be detected correctly on rhel(Redhat Enterprise Linux)</summary>

incubator-mxnet/Makefile


         Line 221
      in
      2dbd143






 FIND_LIBFILE=$(wildcard /usr/lib/lib$(FIND_LIBNAME).$(FIND_LIBFILEEXT)) 





Refer to the mxnet Makefile above, the search paths for gperftools-devel and jemalloc-devel are under /lib//usr/lib//usr/local/lib.
But gperftools-devel and jemalloc-devel package installed via yum will place the dynamic library files into /usr/lib64
TL,DR;
As the title said.

		Seems my pull request had solved it when I proposed this issue.
Don't have time to verify now.
