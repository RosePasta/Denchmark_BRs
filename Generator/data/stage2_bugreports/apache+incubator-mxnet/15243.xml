	<summary>Profiler: Operator Aggregate Stats Duplication</summary>
	<description>
When call profiler.dumps(), operators' call count is 2x the actual value.
This is because in ProfileOperator class in profiler.h, we are profiling a single operator call both as operator and as task (i.e. generating two events in the dump file for each operator call). However, in AggregateStats, we are simply mapping operator names to its stats. We should be a duplication check somewhere.
