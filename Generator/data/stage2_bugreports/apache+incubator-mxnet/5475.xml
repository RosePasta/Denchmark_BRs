	<summary>Difference between ImageIter  and ImageRecordIter</summary>
	<description>
I feed same train.lst and train.rec to ImageIter ImageRecordIter,
val = mx.io.ImageRecordIter(
......
batch_size          = batch_size,
data_shape          = (3, 224, 224),
label_width          = 2,
rand_crop           = True,
rand_mirror         = True)
val = mx.img.ImageIter(
......
batch_size          = batch_size,
data_shape          = (3, 224, 224),
label_width          = 2,
rand_crop           = True ,
rand_mirror         = True)
But Evalutation genetated from ImageRecordIter is extremly better.
I curious about what preprocess ImageRecordIter is doing on  a raw image

: This issue has been inactive for the past 90 days. It has no label and needs triage.
For general "how-to" questions, our &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.mxnet.io/&gt;user forum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (and &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.gluon.ai/&gt;Chinese version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) is a good place to get help.

 have you had a chance to try this out on a recent version?
its been a long time, but do you have the dataset/script that you used when you saw the issue?

 Its difficult to reproduce this issue with little information provided. I tried to reproduce this issue on Caltech dataset. Was not able to do it. Referred:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/basic/data.html#using-imagerecorditer&gt;https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/basic/data.html#using-imagerecorditer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Didn't see any difference between images generated by ImageRecordIter and ImageIter
Used resnet 50 model for inference. Didn't see any major accuracy difference.
I will be closing this issue for now. Please reopen if closed in error or if issue still persists. Please provide script with which you saw this difference.
