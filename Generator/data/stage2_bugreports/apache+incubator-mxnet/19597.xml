	<summary>Unable to load vgg16 using mx.model.load_checkpoint</summary>
	<description>
Hi all,
I am trying to load vgg16 pre-trained model I download from the mxnet website:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://data.mxnet.io/models/imagenet/vgg/vgg16-0000.params&gt;http://data.mxnet.io/models/imagenet/vgg/vgg16-0000.params&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://data.mxnet.io/models/imagenet/vgg/vgg16-symbol.json&gt;http://data.mxnet.io/models/imagenet/vgg/vgg16-symbol.json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, I keep getting the following error at line 
mxnet.base.MXNetError: MXNetError: Failed loading Op prob of type SoftmaxOutput: [20:27:58] /home/user/mxnet/3rdparty/tvm/nnvm/src/core/op.cc:73: Check failed: op != nullptr: Operator SoftmaxOutput is not registered**
Can someone help me fix this issue?
(I am using MXNet 1.7.0)

 can you list the step-by-step instructions to reproduce? (ie. did you build from source, or install from pip wheel, exact code to load the model, etc..)

 I built from the source and then created a sym-link  to my virtual environment on Ubuntu 20.04.
I am getting the error while loading vgg16 from disk using the provided weight and symbol files:
Code:
import mxnet as mx
(symbol, argParams, auxParams) = mx.model.load_checkpoint("vgg16", 0)
Error:

This error means the operator isnt registered. How are you building MXnet from source. Can you give step by step instructions to reproduce (ie. clone, make/cmake, PYTHONPATH, etc)
Is this error unique to your custom build? or does it fail when you use the publicly available pre-built pip wheels too?

 sure. These are the steps I followed.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet.git mxnet
$ cp config/linux_gpu.cmake config.cmake
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build . --parallel 4
$ cd ~/.virtualenvs/dl4cv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/
$ ln -s ~/mxnet/python/mxnet mxnet
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I haven't tried with the pre-built pip wheel yet. But I did try a few older versions of MXNet building them from source and got the same error.

 it looks like after the clone you build immediately. This means you're building MXNet's master branch, rather than 1.7. Did you mean to do a  after the clone?

 Thanks a lot. You're right. I had forgotten to checkout v1.7.0.
It works now (though I had to downgrade cuda toolkit from version 11.1 to 10.2).

		Cool, thanks for the update. We added support for CUDA 11 in v1.8.x branch, you can try that one out if you need a newer version of CUDA.

 Sure, I'll try that. Thanks again.
