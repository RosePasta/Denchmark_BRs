	<summary>mxnet.rnn.BucketSentenceIter has bug</summary>
	<description>
suppose we have sentences with length [11, 12, 13, 14, 19], all &lt;= 20,
and we provide two bucket keys [30, 40],
after we call mxnet.rnn.BucketSentenceIter will raise an

IndexError: too many indices for array

this happens with the following program statement,
label[:, :-1] = buck[:, 1:]
because bucket with key 40 is empty
one possible solution is to add the following program statement after line 104
self.data = [i for i in self.data if i]

		I'm trying to follow the code example in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/rnn/lstm_bucketing.py&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/rnn/lstm_bucketing.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I get this error also.
