	<summary>worker node could not exit</summary>
	<description>
When using dist_async kvstore, trainning cannot exit.
I found that when worker node with id 0 exited before other worker node, destructor of  KVStoreDist would   call SendCommandToServers(kStopServer, "");.
It would  trigger server node did not process new request of other node.
