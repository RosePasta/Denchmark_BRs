	<summary>WarpCTC build failure in 1.5.0</summary>
	<description>
Building the warpCTC plugin fails i 1.5.0 due to this PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14270&gt;#14270&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It fails with the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In file included from plugin/warpctc/warpctc.cc:27:0:
plugin/warpctc/./warpctc-inl.h: In member function ‘virtual bool mxnet::op::WarpCTCProp::InferShape(mxnet::ShapeVector*, mxnet::ShapeVector*, mxnet::ShapeVector*) const’:

     mxnet::TShape label_shape(dshape.ndim() - 1);

                                                ^
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

looks like nnvm::Tshape takes a single int for constructor:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/nnvm/include/nnvm/tuple.h#L352&gt;https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/nnvm/include/nnvm/tuple.h#L352&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But mxnet::Tshape does not have this constructor, instead we provide the default value as well (which is value: 1 in nnvm)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/include/mxnet/tuple.h#L406&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/include/mxnet/tuple.h#L406&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
