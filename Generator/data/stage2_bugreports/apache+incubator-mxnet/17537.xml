	<summary>Outdated mxnet nightly build wheel instructions</summary>
	<description>
The mxnet nightly pip wheel instructions are outdated. The latest wheels are available at &lt;denchmark-link:https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dist/index.html&gt;https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dist/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Shall we update the website with this link? Or maybe at least the static links to latest builds

 this page doesn't seem to work when accessed from the alias &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/index.html&gt;https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 you are correct, the way Javascript XMLHttpRequest works the page and links must be in the same domain as the one the page is accessed from. Heres a link to the official explanation: &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. So either we do it at &lt;denchmark-link:https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com&gt;https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or we do it at &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.mxnet.io&gt;https://repo.mxnet.io&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but we cannot do both at the same time.
If we are officially blessing this page and making it official we can switch it. Otherwise if the community wants to do something different we can leave it and just access it at &lt;denchmark-link:https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dist/index.html&gt;https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dist/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 until the community implements a new solution.

		Do it at  &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.mxnet.io&gt;https://repo.mxnet.io&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 sounds better. The link is easier to remember compared to the other one. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/samskalicky&gt;@samskalicky&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 what do you think

		Honestly I dont think the link matters. We're going to embed it in the website and wont expect users to remember the URL by heart. There is no static website at &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.mxnet.io/&gt;https://repo.mxnet.io/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 anyway, so there no expectation that the download page should work at that address.
I dont think its a big deal which one we access it from since it will be a link in a webpage.

		The key problem here is

If we are officially blessing this page and making it official we can switch it. Otherwise if the community wants to do something different we can leave it and just access it at https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dist/index.html until the community implements a new solution.

To obtain that blessing, the builds located at that side should be created from a community controlled (ie. controlled via some configuration files in a public repository) resource. Has the Jenkins CD already replaced the proprietary build pipeline?

 I dont think that matters. The bucket will contain the nightly pip wheels regardless of where they are built from. If they are built from a proprietary system or a publicly accessible one they will go to the same/similar location in the bucket and the webpage will just show them.
This is like saying I wont drive a BMW because its built in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.bmwgroup-plants.com/spartanburg/en.html&gt;Spartanburg, South Carolina&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 instead of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.bmw-welt.com/en/locations/plant.html&gt;Munich, Germany&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Irregardless, ive started a PR to add the scripts used in the current CodeBuild system: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17550&gt;#17550&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If having these scripts in the repo is sufficient, we can finish adding the rest of the scripts and updating the CodeBuild projects to execute these scripts. We can also make build logs and other status updates available to the community as well. Heres one build badge for the plain mxnet build flavor:

		CD was fixed but was failing again after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15990&gt;#15990&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as it didn't take CD into account. &lt;denchmark-link:http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/656/pipeline#step-487-log-408&gt;http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/656/pipeline#step-487-log-408&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think we should focus on fixing and maintaining one solution instead of creating more distraction

		For &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/index.html&gt;https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I did the following:

fixed the javascript so that it can be accessed from both the above url and the https://apache-mxnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dist/index.html
added order and filter to the nightly builds table.

The current practice for a fixed url is simply incorrect. The version used is misleading and claims to be an official release version. This is not an acceptable solution so I'm currently working on updating the static links to the same solution as pytorch nightly page such as this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html&gt;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The directory listing files are now available. I updated the &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/index.html&gt;https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the links. It's now possible to install nightly builds with the same command:

Let's update the installation instructions to use the directory listing files.

		According to Apache incubator VP, the nightly builds should not be offered to the public and only developers should have access.
