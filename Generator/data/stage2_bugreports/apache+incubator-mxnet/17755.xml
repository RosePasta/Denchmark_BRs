		The current issue is that the nightly maven pipeline is still publishing 1.6.0-SNAPSHOT, not the expected 1.7.0-SNAPSHOT. I added some PRs to update the version numbers for Scala (it got missed by the earlier PR) in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17764&gt;#17764&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17765&gt;#17765&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
As part of this, we should also move the nightly maven pipeline to target the v1.x branch instead of the master branch as well (&lt;denchmark-link:http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-publish-artifacts/&gt;http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-publish-artifacts/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). We can create a second pipeline to target master once the version numbers on master are updated to 2.0.

 I'm working on this. it depends on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17775&gt;#17775&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (so that we don't have to introduce additional jenkins global variable...)

 The scala CD is not part of the CD system that you are working on located at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/cd&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/cd&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but a completely different one located at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/ci/publish&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/ci/publish&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It also has a separate Jenkins pipeline (&lt;denchmark-link:http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-publish-artifacts/&gt;http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-publish-artifacts/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). There shouldn't be any dependency on your work to get this issue resolved

		The old PR was merged and I updated the pipeline to also build the  branch and started the &lt;denchmark-link:http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-publish-artifacts/job/v1.x/&gt;first build&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Once this build passes, this issue should be resolved.

		The build passed and the nightly tests are now &lt;denchmark-link:http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/NightlyTests/job/master/621/&gt;passing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
