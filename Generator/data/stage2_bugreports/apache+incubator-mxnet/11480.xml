	<summary>Image classfication example has wrong accuracy metric.</summary>

, the  is initialized with  unset, which will be its &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/callback.py#L142&gt;default value&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i.e. . This will make the logged  incorrect, since the module and the speedometer share the same metric.
Following is the current log for 1 epoch:

Following is the log with auto_reset set to False:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;INFO:root:Epoch[1] Batch [20]	Speed: 1366.77 samples/sec	accuracy=0.518601

INFO:root:Epoch[1] Train-accuracy=0.579803
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that when auto_reset=True, the batch-wise accuracy is correct, but epoch-wise is wrong. When auto_reset=False, the batch-wise one is incorrect, but epoch-wise is correct.
I believe there are two fixes:

Manually set auto_reset=False to log accumulated accuracy for each batch.
Set an independent metric for the speedometer.

		it seems that this error was predicted, based on review comments on the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/5827&gt;#5827&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Checking what can be done differently to fix this issue.

 Upon further investigation, it was found that this observation is expected behavior.
"INFO:root:Epoch[1] Train-accuracy=" is not the epoch accuracy - the log is misleading (Ref: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10437&gt;#10437&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). The plan is to remove this print statement altogether.
The log for batch is based on a user-specified value which prints a log at regular intervals (--disp-batches in fit.py).

		A separate metric is being maintained for epoch metric vs batch-wise metric. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hxhxhx88&gt;@hxhxhx88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Please have a look at PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12182&gt;#12182&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It would be great if you could verify it at your end as well.
