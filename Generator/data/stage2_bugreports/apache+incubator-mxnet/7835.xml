For bugs or installation issues, please provide the following information.
The more information you provide, the more likely people will be able to help you.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment info&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Operating System:
Windows 7, 64bit
Compiler:
Package used (Python/R/Scala/Julia):
C++, Visual Studio 2013/2015
MXNet version:
windows prebuild Yajiedesign release 20170902
Or if installed from source:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yajiedesign/mxnet/releases/tag/20170902&gt;https://github.com/yajiedesign/mxnet/releases/tag/20170902&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm running a simple CNN using C++ API. CPU only, no GPU. The program runs well without any batchnorm operation. Training and validation accuracy increased reasonably with increased epochs.
However, once the batchnorm was added, e.g. between the convolution and relu. Validation didn't work correctly. I can still see the training accuracy increased reasonably. However, validation accuracy didn't show any increasing trend even after long time training.
I tried on different computers. The same network runs correctly with pure Python for both networks with and without batchnorm operation. Tried GPU version with C++ also and encountering the same problem.
Any trick to use batchnorm with C++ package, esp. the CPU version?
Thanks for any help.

		Having same problem. Noticed that the Mathematica version 11.2 (using MxNet under the hood) is not able to reproduce my earlier modified InceptionV3 network tested in version 10. Also the my c++/windows MxNetwork seem to have this decreasing loss but almost equal loss validation rates.

For general "how-to" questions, our &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.mxnet.io/&gt;user forum&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (and &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.gluon.ai/&gt;Chinese version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) is a good place to get help.

 can you provide a minimum reproducible example ?

		We wnt on using Python only. As MxNet moved ahead, we will try to use the c++ package again later this year. For time being, let's close it.

		Hi,

thanks for addressing.

We went on using Python only. As MxNet moved ahead, we will try to use the c++ package again later this year. For time being, I have closed the thread.

@relaxli00&lt;https://github.com/relaxli00&gt; @Bumblebee1964&lt;https://github.com/bumblebee1964&gt; can you provide a minimum reproducible example ?
