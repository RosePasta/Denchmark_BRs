	<summary>beta website doesn't render html tags for images</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When trying to fix &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mli/new-docs/pull/123&gt;mli/new-docs#123&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I found that html code that should render fine in a markdown file, doesn't get converted when building the site. However, video html codes worked fine.
There's no warning or error. It just skips those lines of code.
Seems like a bug with the new site's build.
Refer to this commit to see the difference of what was there before that didn't work, compared to was did work. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mli/new-docs/commit/58b88f83b91c31f2fa31a5810f9563ed581a498c&gt;mli/new-docs@58b88f8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
