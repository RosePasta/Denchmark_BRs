	<summary>Inconsistent behavior for empty NDArray.</summary>
	<description>
MXNet.nd.NDArray doesn't support empty NDArray. For example mx.nd.zeros((0,)) fails. However, mx.nd.array([]) still suceeds.

		As discussed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/reminisce&gt;@reminisce&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we can allow creation of empty tensors, but we don't allow shape inference on empty tensors.
