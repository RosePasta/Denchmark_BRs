i have try only run
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mxnet::cpp::NDArray data = GetDataBatch(src, faces)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

it haven`t momery leak,,so i think the problem is not in here.
is my code wrong in use Executor?
thank you!

 Can you provide more details like MXNet version, how you've built this package - also it would be helpful if you will post your net definition and input shapes

 Can you check with debugger stack trace when memory leak happen? I can't reproduce this issue without network definition. Are you sure that this loop with memcpy is right?

 can I get your email address?I can send your the net Json file and my inference code(if your have free time).thank your so much.I can make sure there is not memory leak except this function.thank you so much!

 the reason isn`t cout, i use the same code with v1.5.x,there is not memory leak,but v1.7.x.....

 You can create private repository on github with the code and give me an access to it. I will look at this

 thanks to reporting this issue and it's really important for us.
Could you help provide a reproducer? Maybe a proxy model is fine which will accelerate our debugging progress?

 we need minimal part of your model that causes this memory leak, currently we don't even know which operators you're using
And as I said before, if you're still ok with that:

@ZHEQIUSHUI You can create private repository on github with the code and give me an access to it. I will look at this

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pengzhao-intel&gt;@pengzhao-intel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 i just create a new  repository and invited you to it,you can come if you need the model json file.

 Would you mind to share also inference code in github repository?
