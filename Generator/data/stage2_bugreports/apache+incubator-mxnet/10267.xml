	<summary>Continue train in R: what is begin_round?</summary>
	<description>
Suppose I train a model in R with
begin.round = 1
num.round = 10
and now I would like to continue training for 20 epochs, do I have to set
begin.round = 11
num.round = 20
or
begin.round = 11
num.round = 30
or something else?
I am very confused because mxnet lets me insert any arbitrary number for the begin.round argument. For example:
begin.round = 15
num.round = 30
does also work, but it should not since I only trained for 10 epochs and clearly cannot beginn training at epoch 15.

		I had the same question a while ago, I now use this:
begin.round =n.rounds, num.round=n.rounds+extra.iter
Where n.rounds was the total number of rounds previously trained on.

		Wouldn't
begin.round = n.rounds + 1
make more sense?
Anyway, that still does not explain why MXNet allows to use any arbitrary integer for the
begin.round argument

		Ya I dont think it matters.  All you are actually doing is selecting a slice in a vector to add new content.  It doesnt matter where you start and end.  It is up to the user to select the correct slice.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NiklasDL&gt;@NiklasDL&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thanks for trying out MXNetR.  I understand your confusion regarding begin.round and num.round. As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/some-guy1&gt;@some-guy1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested, the right way to think is
begin.round =n.rounds+x, num.round=n.rounds+extra.iter+x
where x&gt;0 and n.rounds is the number of epochs for which model was trained previously.
