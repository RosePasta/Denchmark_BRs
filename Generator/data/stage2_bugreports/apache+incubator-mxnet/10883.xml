As I was told by "&lt;denchmark-link:http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/&gt;http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
"
After inputting
"make -j $(nproc) USE_OPENCV=1 USE_BLAS=openblas"
I got these errors:

		Thanks for reporting the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lovehuanhuan&gt;@lovehuanhuan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Have you tried a clean install of mxnet by doing  and then building the library? Is the problem still persisting?

 This is an old issue but just checking in to see if this is still an issue. I could use the same build command to build MXNet from source without any issues.

, please reopen if the problem persists.
