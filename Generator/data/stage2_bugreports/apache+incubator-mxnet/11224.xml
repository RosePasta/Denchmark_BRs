	<summary>‘make lint’ is broken under python2</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/blob/master/scripts/lint.py&gt;https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/blob/master/scripts/lint.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was changed to python3 by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/396&gt;dmlc/dmlc-core#396&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

So if one is using python2 and pylint/cpplint are not presented in his python3 environment, make lint will fail.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment info (Required)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;What to do:
1. Download the diagnosis script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/master/tools/diagnose.py
2. Run the script using `python diagnose.py` and paste its output here.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Package used (Python/R/Scala/Julia):
python
For Scala user, please provide:

Java version: (java -version)
Maven version: (mvn -version)
Scala runtime if applicable: (scala -version)

For R user, please provide R sessionInfo():
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Build info (Required if built from source)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 thanks for submitting this issue.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy&gt;@sandeep-krishnamurthy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you add label "Bug" &amp; "Python" to this issue?

 I am looking into this issue. Could you please update the "Steps to reproduce". The error I got when running "make lint" is below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scripts/lint.py", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;
    import cpplint
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cpplint'
make: *** [lint] Error 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Sorry if my question sounds too silly, I am still new to this community. Thanks!

 Thank you for asking that. That's the exact error I got. I have no idea why your traceback didn't give a full path of  file.

 Thanks for your reply. I could reproduce the error you reported now. I will start working on the fix.

 The fix is actually in dmlc_core repo. I have opened a PR there: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/411&gt;dmlc/dmlc-core#411&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Maybe we should link this issue with the PR?

 The problem is still there for me. Seems it happens in dmlc-core, so why you change mshadow?

 please ignore my previous comment. That fix was for CI only. Sorry for the confusion.
Nonetheless, I still don't seem to have the issue using python2 in my MXNet virtual env.
Here is my virtual env package list:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;certifi==2018.4.16
chardet==3.0.4
coremltools==0.8
graphviz==0.8.4
idna==2.6
-e git+https://github.com/apeforest/incubator-mxnet.git@da6b714e20f22800c5f632c7e32984b25436e3cb#egg=mxnet&amp;subdirectory=python
nose==1.3.7
numpy==1.14.5
protobuf==3.6.0
PyYAML==3.13
requests==2.18.4
six==1.10.0
urllib3==1.22
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And if I run make lint at the root directory of mxnet, it just runs smoothly. Could you please let me know the packages in your virtualenv?

		I guess you also have a py3 environment which has cpplint and pylint installed there. Could you try to uninstall cpplint and pylint in py3 firstly before run make lint in py2?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip3 uninstall cpplint
pip3 uninstall pylint
make lint
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 I could reproduce the error following your comments. I have fixed it and verified in my local environment. PR is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/433&gt;dmlc/dmlc-core#433&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 . I would like to close this issue after dmlc-core is updated to mxnet master branch.

 since you are working on the release of MXNet 1.3 - are you planning to pull in the updated dmlc-core into the new release?
		</comment>
		<comment id='15' author='TaoLv' date='2018-08-07T20:14:15Z'>
		Yes I will be updating dmlc-core in the new release.

 dmlc-core has been pulled in. The fix is in incubator-mxnet now.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy&gt;@sandeep-krishnamurthy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Could you close this issue?
