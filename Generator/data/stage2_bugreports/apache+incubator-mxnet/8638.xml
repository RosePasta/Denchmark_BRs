The function that was working perfectly in mxnet 0.11.0 only works in 0.12.0 if allow_extra parameter in Line 652 in incubator-mxnet/python/mxnet/module/base_module.py is removed

		Thanks Vatsal for replying. I tried to reproduce the issue with setting parameters creating a module and trying to run the training. I wasn't able to reproduce it.
I will be closing this issue for now. Please feel free to open if closed in error.
