	<summary>BatchNorm running variables are not properly synchronized on CPU</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

During investigation of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14357&gt;#14357&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I have found that running_mean and running_var variables are sometimes not yet calculated when converted to NumPy.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Error Message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When runing the python test from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14357#issuecomment-644887485&gt;#14357 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 sometimes there is information that consecutive reads of the same variable differes, which means that backward pass is calculated after the first read:

It shouldn't happen as asnumpy() function should force all needed calculations to get running_var values.
I such case the test shows a  message similar to the one below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;seed: 331752807
cpu(0) - DIFF in running_var reads:
   0 : [3.9974644 3.9977627 3.997775 ] 
   2 : [3.9962945 4.0025434 3.9987571]
cpu(0) [3.9962945 4.0025434 3.9987571] [10.001289  9.997483 10.002162]
gpu(0) [3.9962947 4.0025434 3.9987576] [10.001292  9.997481 10.002162]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Verified on master branch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/9591436967347cc8e34a01e126b696b3447f8081&gt;9591436&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

run python test from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14357#issuecomment-644887485&gt;#14357 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;What have you tried to solve it?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I already have the fix. I will put it to github soon.
