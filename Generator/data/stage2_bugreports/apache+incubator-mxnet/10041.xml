	<summary>Reduce operators do not support axis=None</summary>
	<description>
The sum/mean OPs do not support axis=None. I think it's supported in earlier versions of MXNet. This behavior is inconsistent with Numpy.
import mxnet as mx
b = mx.nd.sum(mx.ones((100, 100)), axis=None)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;MXNetError: Invalid Parameter format for axis expect Shape(tuple) but value='None'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This doesn't seem to be specific to sum/mean ops as I was also able to reproduce it with prod. Which version of MXNet supported this ? I wasn't able to reproduce with 0.11.

		Should be some very old version (way before 0.11). We need to consider to revise the code to support this now.

		  will work.. I guess the problem is that if user provides axis=None, it won't work. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sxjscience&gt;@sxjscience&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Any specific reason why user would provide None???

		None should represent "empty-axis" and should perform a global reduction. It's very common in numpy.
