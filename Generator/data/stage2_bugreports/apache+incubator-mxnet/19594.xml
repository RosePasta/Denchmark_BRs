		Reproduced the issue. As on linux upgrading pip to newest release helped, on win10 was unable to see the package even with pip==20.2.4.

 Do you know what may be the cause?

		I think the problem was that the windows pip package for mxnet has become too large to publish on PyPI.

 I understand. I tried looking for this package but only found whl file for mxnet==1.7.0 (not 1.7.0.post1) for windows. Is this package (1.7.0.post1 for win10) available anywhere?

 Try this package: &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/python/cpu/mxnet-1.7.0-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl&gt;https://repo.mxnet.io/dist/python/cpu/mxnet-1.7.0-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks.
How to find it next time? Or another wheel?

If the package will not decrease in size for future releases I believe it will be hard to publish them on PyPl.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/szha&gt;@szha&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Is there any other public channel to get the win10 version of 1.7.0 and other mxnet release packages?

		Not that I'm aware of. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yajiedesign&gt;@yajiedesign&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was looking into custom compression that may help this, though I think a more reliable way forward is for NVIDIA to publish these dependencies as a separate package that we can depend on.
Let's track this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18793&gt;#18793&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which was intended for tracking CD automation for windows.

 I believe as of now there is no way to find those packages for windows on your own. You can always try building mxnet from source to have recent versions: &lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.7.0/get_started/build_from_source&gt;https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.7.0/get_started/build_from_source&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I would also like to pip install mxnet==1.7.0 on windows.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/szha&gt;@szha&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 How sure are you about the size issue mentioned above?  I noticed that two other mxnet whl files (for macos and linux) are already on PyPi and they are much larger than the one that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bartekkuncer&gt;@bartekkuncer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 helpfully referenced on Monday &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19594#issuecomment-735826843&gt;#19594 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .  That whl file was only about 17MB.  The macos and linux whl files are 30MB and 55MB.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6138503/101098299-88f3ee00-3577-11eb-9c45-1ff83b13a8b3.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I wonder if someone could again try to send the Windows whl file to PyPi?  It would be a big help to me. Thanks!

		hi, same problem here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75791502/101986456-3361c480-3c8e-11eb-95f2-50289e170d04.JPG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried to activate the package of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bartekkuncer&gt;@bartekkuncer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but not working either...
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75791502/101986580-e9c5a980-3c8e-11eb-81f6-eea84ddab3cd.JPG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 what you have seems to be a different problem where compilation for numpy failed. you can try to first install numpy directly (to hopefully pick up pre-built binary instead of building from source) and then install mxnet.

 I see that the numpy package was taken from cache. It is possible that there were some problems during download and therefore it does not work now. You might want to try  which will ignore cached libs. Please let me know if it helps.
If it goes to missing environment, you have to create one first to be able to activate it. I believe you do not need it to install mxnet with pip.

		I tried to uninstall/reinstall numpy successfully, then try both pip install mxnet and pip install --no-cache-dir mxnet but I still have the same problem. I really do not understand... I finally installed TensorFlow that seems working just fine... Thank you anyway guys!
