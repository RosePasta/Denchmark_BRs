		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/leezu&gt;@leezu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I couldn't reproduce this issue, so I've investigated logs deeply and here is what I've deduced:
Log that you provided is not complete, other log from jenkins &lt;denchmark-link:https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/mxnet-validation/job/unix-cpu/view/change-requests/job/PR-19374/2/consoleText&gt;https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/mxnet-validation/job/unix-cpu/view/change-requests/job/PR-19374/2/consoleText&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

shows logs from many parallel jobs and it's complete log.
You can copy this line to find same place in these two files:

Line which caused fail is:
[2020-10-19T22:43:56.241Z] Aborted by mxnet-bot
what probably means that you rerun CI and mxnet-bot just killed this session.
In next lines you can find
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Failed in branch Python3: MKLDNN-CPU
Failed in branch Python3: CPU
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and if you will search for more 'Failed in branch Python3:'
you will get [2020-10-19T21:31:54.420Z] Failed in branch Python3: CPU TVM_OP OFF
meaning that TVM_OP job 1 hour before failing MKLDNN-CPU and CPU branches
So summarizing the above it's some mxnet-bot issue rather than MKLDNN, caused by rerunning tests

		Thank you for investigating &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bgawrych&gt;@bgawrych&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I'm sorry that I missed the  line..
