	<summary>missing commands in the instructions for building from source</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As part of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18487&gt;#18487&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the build from source instruction no longer includes the commands for building from source. Also, it doesn't document the usage of the cmake configs in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/config&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/config&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The documentation is contained in the files. The instructions read "Please see the cmake configuration files files for instructions on how to configure and build MXNet with cmake."



incubator-mxnet/config/linux.cmake


        Lines 18 to 36
      in
      19e373d






 #------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 



 #  Template configuration for compiling MXNet 



 # 



 #  If you want to change the configuration, please use the following steps. 



 #  Assume you are on the root directory of mxnet. First copy this file so that 



 #  any local changes will be ignored by git 



 # 



 #  $ cp config/linux.cmake config.cmake 



 # 



 #  Next modify the according entries, and then compile by 



 # 



 #  $ mkdir build; cd build 



 #  $ cmake .. 



 #  $ cmake --build . 



 # 



 # Specify `cmake --build . --parallel N` to set the number of parallel compilation jobs. 



 # Default is derived from CPUs available.

Including more detailed and version-specific guides could be achieved as part of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18666&gt;#18666&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
