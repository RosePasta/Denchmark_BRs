	<summary>ARM CI cannot authenticate /install `autoconf`</summary>

 error happens on CI as well. It seems to interact with the APT cache persistence. Once the invalid file get's into the cache, it is not deleted anymore and all subsequent CI runs fail. Ie apt will not delete and re-download the file, but rather throw an error:

which all fail due to the invalid autconf in apt cache.

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Not sure how to reproduce. Relies on getting invalid data into the CI cache..
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

How is caching is currently implemented? Is it specific to each branch / PR? Why did this caching error only occur in my PR and did not affect all other builds?

		Nevermind, I think the reason this happens on CI now is that I changed another file used for building the  Docker container. Consequently the docker cache is not reused anymore. So it's exactly the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16753&gt;#16753&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
