	<summary>can't import mxnet</summary>
	<description>
After installing mxnet via pip I've tried to import the mxnet package, but unfortunately I've got this error message:
Illegal instruction (core dumped)
I think there are some problems with my cpu. My cpu: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor DRAM Controller

		Which one are you installed? Could you share the CMD line?

		You're using a too old cpu to be supported by the existing pip package. The CPU does not support some instructions used by the pip package. Please compile from source as a workaround.
The pip packages will be fixed in the next release.

 please recommend if we like to backport the build improvements to 1.7 release and fix this issue for 1.7. Otherwise the pip wheels will remain broken on older cpu until 2.x release

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/leezu&gt;@leezu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, do you mean &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18408&gt;#18408&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will address this issue for the pip wheels? If so, i suggest to include this fix in v1.7.x and v1.x to make the upcoming release more stable :) Thanks.
