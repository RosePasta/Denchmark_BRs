	<summary>3rdparty/openmp cmake build broken on some systems</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17098&gt;#17098&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and please help to review it.
cmake -GNinja -DUSE_CUDA=ON will currently fail on some systems, as OpenMP detects and attempts to build nvptx offloading target (which is not needed, but whose build fails).
