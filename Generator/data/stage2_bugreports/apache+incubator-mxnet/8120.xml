	<summary>[R] Bug introduced in initializer between 0.10.1 and 0.11.1</summary>
	<description>
Issue with MXNet R package, first observed in 0.11.1. Compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04.
The initializers (uniform, normal, Xavier) now return all near 0s.
The bugs appear to come from the mx.runif and mx.rnorm in Random.R, which themselves rely on mx.nd.internal.sample.uniform and mx.nd.internal.sample.normal.
The usage of the random functions such as mx.nd.random.uniform instead of the sample functions seems more appropriate for the initialization task. Right now, as all weights are initialized to zeros, no model training is possible.
I'll open a pull with a quick fix for the initializers.
