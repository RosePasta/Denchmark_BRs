use custom sigmoid op in "incubator-mxnet\docs\tutorials\gluon\customop.md"
running "a = mx.nd.array([1,2,3,4])
mx.nd.Custom(data=a, op_type='sigmoid')" would be dead.


&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;What have you tried to solve it?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

"mx.nd.Custom(a, op_type='sigmoid')" is OK.

		There is no usage or example that using data as argument in mx.nd.Custom or mx.nd.array. Maybe you may confused with usage of mx.sym.*.

 (and &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.gluon.ai/&gt;Chinese version&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) is a good place to get help.
