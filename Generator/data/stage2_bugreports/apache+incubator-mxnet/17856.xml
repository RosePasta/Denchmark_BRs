	<summary>RecordFileDetection doesn't return grayscale images</summary>
	<description>
Minimum amount of work:
RecordFileDetection returns images with three channels.
I propose it has a flag similar to LSTFileDetection which allows us to return grayscale images.
It looks like the baseclass already allows for this flag.
