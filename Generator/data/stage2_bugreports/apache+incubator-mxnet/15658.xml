	<summary>profile_symbolic flag not working in profiler</summary>
	<description>
We use profiler.set_config() to control the profiler's behaviors, i.e. what to profile.
profile_symbolic and profile_imperative are two parameters to control whether to profile operators called in the two modes respectively. However, it seems currently profiler_symbolic is not functioning correctly.
In the screenshot below, we have a simple scrip that has plus_scalar in symbolic mode and minus_scalar in imperative mode. profile_symbolic and profile_imperative are both set to True and we do see both events in profiler.dumps().

However, if we set profile_symbolic and profile_imperative to False. The minus_sclar event is gone, but we still have the plus_scalar event, which is not the expected behavior.

		I looked into the code. It seemed like even though  was defined, it was never used anywhere. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/anirudh2290&gt;@anirudh2290&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you know about this?
