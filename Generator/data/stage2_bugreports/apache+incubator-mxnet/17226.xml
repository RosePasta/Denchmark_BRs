	<summary>Compile from Source instructions re-use CI install scripts</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The "compile from source" instructions re-use CI install scripts. But the CI scripts contain hacky modifications that shouldn't be applied to user systems silently. For example



incubator-mxnet/ci/docker/install/ubuntu_core.sh


        Lines 55 to 66
      in
      83a23b0






 # Use libturbojpeg package as it is correctly compiled with -fPIC flag 



 # https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/issues/147 



 ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libturbojpeg.so.0.1.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libturbojpeg.so 



 



 



 # CMake 3.13.2+ is required 



 mkdir /opt/cmake &amp;&amp; cd /opt/cmake 



 wget -nv https://cmake.org/files/v3.13/cmake-3.13.5-Linux-x86_64.sh 



 sh cmake-3.13.5-Linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/opt/cmake --skip-license 



 ln -s /opt/cmake/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake 



 rm cmake-3.13.5-Linux-x86_64.sh 



 cmake --version 





We don't have any logic to undo such system changes when the user uninstall mxnets, neither is it a good practice to do such system changes in a install script whose audience are novice users..
