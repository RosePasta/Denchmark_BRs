	<summary>NPE in BucketingModule when providedLabel of DataBatch is not set</summary>
	<description>
Package: Scala
Mxnet Version: 1.1.0
Java Version: openjdk 1.8.0_131
Maven Version: [unused]
Scala Runtime: 2.12.4
We create a DataBatch without setting the providedLabel field. We then call BucketingModule.forward(...) with the data batch and get a NullPointerException:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;java.lang.NullPointerException was thrown.
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at ml.dmlc.mxnet.DataDesc$.ListMap2Descs(IO.scala:252)
	at ml.dmlc.mxnet.module.BucketingModule.forward(BucketingModule.scala:313)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This happens because the implicit method ListMap2Descs tries to convert ListMap[String, Shape] into IndexedSeq[DataDesc] but fails because the former is null by default.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/milandesai&gt;@milandesai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you please tell me which version of MXNet you are using?
we are also facing some issues about  in some other issues. And you are right, there is  no good way to avoid this. The minimum fix you can take is using what I have tried with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11753&gt;RNN example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, adding a handler in this conversion function to let /Empty   being passed.
There will be an upcoming PR address this issue. Since it was a pain from v0.11.0. The currently planning is getting rid of ListMap and use DataDesc entirely so we can avoid the implicit conversion. Will keep track on this and see if that can help.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lanking520&gt;@lanking520&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the mxnet version is 1.1.0, though I believe this issue should exist on master as well based on a quick check. I resolved this by modifying the source in IO.scala to simply do a null check. Will post a PR shortly for reference.
