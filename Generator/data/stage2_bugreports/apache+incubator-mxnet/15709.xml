	<summary>Transpose does not support inplace</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Crash with below code snippet:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import mxnet as mx
import numpy as np

a = mx.sym.Variable('a')
b = mx.sym.transpose(a, axes=(1, 0, 2))
c = mx.sym.zeros_like(b)

mod = c.simple_bind(mx.cpu(), a=(3, 4, 5), grad_req='null')
mod.arg_arrays[0][:] = np.random.normal(size=mod.arg_arrays[0].shape)
out = mod.forward(is_train=False)
print(out[0]) 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mxnet.base.MXNetError: [22:56:12] src/operator/tensor/./matrix_op-inl.h:328: Check failed: req[0] == kWriteTo (0 vs. 1) : Transpose does not support inplace
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment info (Required)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Package used (Python/R/Scala/Julia):
Python
Reproduce:
pip install mxnet and run the demo case above.

		Hi,
I would like to work on this. However I'll need some pointer as to how to go about it or even a reference of other operator which supports this should do.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kshitij12345&gt;@kshitij12345&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thank you for looking into this. Your contribution will be highly appreciated!
Actually this is not an in-place issue and the transpose operator in MXNet is not designed to support in-place.
From the error log and the check at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/matrix_op-inl.h#L334&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/matrix_op-inl.h#L334&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the  here is  which means the operator should do nothing before return.
So the logic should look like:
if (req[0] == kNullOp) {
  return;
} else {
  CHECK_EQ(req[0], kWriteTo) &lt;&lt; "Transpose does not support kWriteInplace or kAddTo";
  // ....
}

 Oh, I see. Thank You for the nice explanation. Will send a PR soon.
