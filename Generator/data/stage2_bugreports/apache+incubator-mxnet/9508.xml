	<summary>Gluon Conv1DTranspose causes "kernel died"</summary>
	<description>
Using pip-installed mxnet-cu90-1.0.1b20171229. Similar codes, Conv2DTranspose works fine and Conv1DTranspose causes kernel death, in Spyder 3.2.6.  Windows 10 / Anaconda 3 / Python 3.6
The working code with Conv2DTranspose:
==== 2D code ====
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import gluon as g
import numpy as np
ctx = mx.cpu()
img = np.zeros((1, 3, 7))
img = img.reshape(img.shape[0], 3, 7, 1)
dataLoader = g.data.DataLoader(img, batch_size=1)
net = g.nn.Sequential()
with net.name_scope():
net.add(g.nn.Conv2DTranspose(channels=3, kernel_size=(3,1), activation='relu'))
net.collect_params().initialize(mx.init.Normal(sigma=0.05))
for data in dataLoader:
img = data.astype('float32')
img = img.as_in_context(ctx)
output = net(img)
==== 2D code end ====
Changed to 1D case, kernel dies every time:
==== 1D code ====
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import gluon as g
import numpy as np
ctx = mx.cpu()
img = np.zeros((1, 3, 7))
dataLoader = g.data.DataLoader(img, batch_size=1)
net = g.nn.Sequential()
with net.name_scope():
net.add(g.nn.Conv1DTranspose(channels=3, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'))
net.collect_params().initialize(mx.init.Normal(sigma=0.05))
for data in dataLoader:
img = data.astype('float32')
img = img.as_in_context(ctx)
output = net(img)
==== 1D code end ====
Is there any trick for the Conv1DTranspose usage?
Thanks.

		Hello, I tried to re-produce this issue earlier today with Spyder 3.2.6 on Windows 10/ CUDA 9.0/ Python 3.6.4 but with a newer build: mxnet-cu90-1.2.0b20180403 and was not able to reproduce the same bug. Please try the same code again with a newer build on your machine, and see if this bug still pops up, thanks for reporting the bug!

		Please go ahead to close it. Iâ€™m away currently and will turn back after a month or so. Will let you know if any problem is found at that time. Thanks.
