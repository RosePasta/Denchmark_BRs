	<description>
In MXNet 1.8, XLNet model fails to run due to bug in runtime fusion:

The issue persists with the latest nightly builds of the 1.x branch, ie applies to the 1.8 release. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/1384&gt;dmlc/gluon-nlp#1384&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Well, I kind of agree it is a fusion bug, but this specific failure should also be tackled on the Gluon-NLP side. Having so many expand_dims on 1 thing suggests at least a performance bug in there.
		</comment>
		<comment id='2' author='leezu' date='2020-10-08T20:45:58Z'>
		The concern here is that the regression breaks models that worked without problem.
		</comment>
		<comment id='3' author='leezu' date='2020-10-08T20:46:45Z'>
		But is it actually a regression? Do 1.6/1.7 work with the same model? I don't think they would work.
		</comment>
		<comment id='4' author='leezu' date='2020-10-08T20:51:20Z'>
		Yes, this works in 1.6. There are separate integration tests for 1.6 and nightly build in GluonNLP and the 1.6 tests pass. You can refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/1237#issuecomment-686790435&gt;dmlc/gluon-nlp#1237 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which introduced a version of MXNet containing the regression. I confirmed that the regression is still present in latest 1.x branch via &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/1384&gt;dmlc/gluon-nlp#1384&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		<comment id='5' author='leezu' date='2020-10-08T20:59:21Z'>
		Ok, so this suggests it broke in 1.7 then. It is quite strange though since if you look at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commits/1.8.0.rc1/src/operator/fusion&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commits/1.8.0.rc1/src/operator/fusion&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 there are only a few commits that went into fusion between 1.6 and 1.7 and none of them looks like something that could affect this.
I will look into this.

		<comment id='6' author='leezu' date='2020-10-08T21:09:11Z'>
		Thank you. You may be right that it's an edge case. Btw, more evidence that this works in 1.6 is that you actually fixed a performance bug based on the GluonNLP XLNet model in 1.6: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17105&gt;#17105&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		</comment>
		<comment id='7' author='leezu' date='2020-10-08T22:08:15Z'>
		Well, that is actually not really an evidence because I am using that exact model (from GluonNLP 0.9.0) for my performance experiments in the current PR (that said, I'm using NVIDIA container, but 1.8rc1 is merged there and I don't believe there are any differences in fusion between NVIDIA version and upstream) and it does not show that issue. So my assumption is that this model changed in the meantime.
		</comment>
		<comment id='8' author='leezu' date='2020-10-08T22:26:56Z'>
		Any change would be verified by the GluonNLP CI. I believe fusion is activated by default in 1.6, thus the CI should test fusion?
These are the outputs of the CI for MXNet 1.6 and 1.x:

 I'm working on this now. There is something fishy going on here - I tried reproducing it by compiling  branch and the test passed. I also tried the pip package that you tried in your PR in GluonNLP, and that one failed. I will try to figure out where does the difference come from.

		Update: the code generation itself seems to be working fine - it is the subgraph it gets that is wrong. I'm not yet sure if this is fault of some bug in common subexpression elimination (since with export MXNET_ELIMINATE_COMMON_EXPR=0 the bug does not repro) or with the fusion graph pass.

		Another update - the problem comes from the eliminate common expressions. In the model there seem to be 12 reshapes of the same input, each followed by 12 expand_dims. In the correct execution, they all get squashed to a single reshape followed by expand_dims, but in the wrong execution the reshapes get squashed into 1, but the (12*12=)144 expand_dims do not, resulting in a fused operator with 144 outputs.
I'm still trying to understand why there is this discrepancy in execution.

		Ok, that was pretty stupid. The reason why expand_dims were not squashed in the official pip wheel for 1.7 and 1.8 is because common expression elimination does not currently try to squash operators that use any ResourceRequest (even though it could if the request is kTempSpace) and with MKLDNN expand_dims actually requests kTempSpace. 1.6 had mkldnn off by default (so worked), but 1.7 and 1.8 have it on by default in the official pip wheels (and it is off in our container, so when I compiled it in that environment I did not repro the problem).
I will make a PR shortly to allow eliminating expressions with tempspace to unblock upgrading GluonNLP to 1.x, then will think about the changes to code generation of fusion, so that this error is not triggered. Generally speaking the problem comes from the fact that we send all the inputs/outputs shapes to the fused kernel even if they are not needed, which greatly pollutes the argument space. One can only use 4096B of arguments for the kernel, so without shapes a fused kernel could have up to 512 inputs/outputs, but having shapes greatly reduces this number (to less than 144 as seen in this bug ;-) ).
