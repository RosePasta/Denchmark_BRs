	<summary>cannot find cpp-package</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The master branch doesn't have the cpp-package directory. It seems in June this was removed?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Error Message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The C++ package is not built. USE_CPP_PACKAGE is not used in the cmake script.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Try to build with the c++ package from master.

 you will need to use the  branch. If you are interested in helping to update the CPP package for the master branch that would be very welcome. (It needs update due to deprecation of some underlying APIs in master)
