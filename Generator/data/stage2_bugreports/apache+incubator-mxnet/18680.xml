	<summary>[Doc] Gluon Block/HybridBlock/SymbolBlock appears at the wrong place in the API doc</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Gluon Block, HybridBlock, SymbolBlock has an empty doc in the API doc. For example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/gluon/block.html&gt;https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/gluon/block.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Their actual docs appear under  domain, which IMO is a wrong place for them. For example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/gluon/nn/index.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Block&gt;https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/gluon/nn/index.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Block&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I notice that 1.6 site displays both locations
&lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.6/api/python/docs/api/gluon/block.html#mxnet.gluon.Block&gt;https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.6/api/python/docs/api/gluon/block.html#mxnet.gluon.Block&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.6/api/python/docs/api/gluon/nn/index.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Block&gt;https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.6/api/python/docs/api/gluon/nn/index.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Block&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Maybe Sphinx get's interrupted during generating the gluon/block.html page because it contains some files with broken links:
For example, the following file refers to API that has been removed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/243ade93bcb8b7962d1faeb89c98409e3ae0d7a4/docs/python_docs/python/api/gluon/parameter_dict.rst&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/243ade93bcb8b7962d1faeb89c98409e3ae0d7a4/docs/python_docs/python/api/gluon/parameter_dict.rst&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Deleting this file may be sufficient for fixing the site
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ys2843&gt;@ys2843&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please help make sure the broken link checker runs on every PR to avoid such issues going forward? Maybe activating the  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/243ade93bcb8b7962d1faeb89c98409e3ae0d7a4/docs/python_docs/python/scripts/conf.py&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/243ade93bcb8b7962d1faeb89c98409e3ae0d7a4/docs/python_docs/python/scripts/conf.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or changing a different option would be sufficient?

 - Should we revert the PR ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18413&gt;#18413&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) if we are unable to fix the broken website issue quickly. Ideally this should have been caught before the PR was merged. We shall work on it as you suggested above to have broken link checker as part of the PR build. But, given currently Python APIs are broken, I prefer we revert and merge back with the fix.
What do you think?

		I suggest we focus on ensuring our users see the stable API docs, given that most users don't use MXNet 2 at this point anyways. This PR has exposed some bugs in the Sphinx setup which need to be fixed before the release; but this is an issue with the website generation script and shouldn't delay the feature development. What do you think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy&gt;@sandeep-krishnamurthy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
