	<summary>ssd inference bug</summary>
	<description>
In SSD inference, the anchor and step-size (width, height) is changed by the original image size, which is Contrary to full convolution idea. In caffe-ssd, the anchor and step-size are fixed, which is the right disign.

		This issue was discussed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet-ssd/issues/156&gt;zhreshold/mxnet-ssd#156&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It's "parent" repository to code in examples.

		TL;DR; author wanted to leave as it is for backward compatibility

 Thank for you reply.
In python vision, I can fix the input size of inference equal to the input size of training by using "self.mod.bind(data_shapes=[('data', (batch_size, 3, data_shape, data_shape))])", which can generate the result close to truth.
But in c++ version,  I only use "simple_bind" function to generate the executor, the shape of executor.data is the shape of input image.
OK, my English is poor, I hope you can understand it, thanks!

		In C++ you can provide NDArray with specific shape as part of args parameter. But you need to create this array beforehand.

		Thanks for opening the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ElegantGod&gt;@ElegantGod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

As discussed offline with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zhreshold&gt;@zhreshold&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the symbol implementation has been likely deprecated and the team has switched to Gluon CV implementation some time back. We have decided to keep the code as it is to retain the backward compatibility.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy&gt;@sandeep-krishnamurthy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you close this issue? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ElegantGod&gt;@ElegantGod&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kalyc&gt;@kalyc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you mark the code deprecated and provide a link to the Gluon CV SSD Implementation to help users.
