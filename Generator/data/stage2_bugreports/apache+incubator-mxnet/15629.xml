		Hey, this is the MXNet Label Bot.
Thank you for submitting the issue! I will try and suggest some labels so that the appropriate MXNet community members can help resolve it.
Here are my recommended labels: Bug

I am closing this for now.

		The version of Python I used is 3.7.3 (default, Jun 24 2019, 04:54:02) [GCC 9.1.0] on Linux too.
I think mxnet::NDArray::SyncCopyFromCPU doesn't support multi processing on some machines.

		Reopen it.  I found a consistent setting to reproduce the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AWS EC2 P3.16-Xlarge
ubuntu 16.04
python: anaconda 3.7.3
mxnet: mxnet-cu100mkl
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The deep learning AMI using anaconda 3.6.5 does not have this problem.

I think this issue is independent with the other. My error only happens when starting a process.

		In addition to what is discussed above: it doesn't matter if it is an EC2 P3.16 or P3.2.
In fact the same thing happened to me on P3.2 after I tried to upgrade Python to 3.7 using anaconda. Latter on I tried get rid of these bugs by using Python 3.6 again but it seems that these issues remain foreverly here from now on.
So frustrating:

The worst of all, there isn't any useful information from the message, except "segment fault". Hope this problem could be solved. But I'm moving on by launching a new server instance now.

		Hi. This is not supported, to fork a process and use MXNet inside. We should probably detect this and throw an error.

		It isn't always like this: normally it won't happen, only after I tried to upgrade Python to 3.7 on server it becomes like this. Also, my laptop has local Python3.7 installed but nothing is wrong here, simply slow (without GPU). For now I couldn't reproduce the error anymore, since I terminated that buggy environment to make my life easier. But it is for sure that the above-mentioned code isn't causing any error on my local mac environment, neither on the other instances I've launched.

		I can confirm that this can be reproduced with anaconda environment + pip installed mxnet.
However,

locally built mxnet + python3.7 have no issue.
mac + python3.7 + pip installed mxnet have no issue.

So I suggest to tranfer this issue to pypi package building pipeline to see if the statically linked libs are causing the error.

		Seems like a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14979&gt;#14979&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and there's more context there, closing to avoid duplicate investigations.
