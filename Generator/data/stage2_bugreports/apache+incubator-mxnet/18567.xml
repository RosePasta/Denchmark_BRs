Another issue: Anchor tags are shifted.
Anchor tags exist, but they don't work properly. They are shifted by certain margin [potentially getting hidden by the header]
For ex:

Go to contribute page : https://mxnet.apache.org/community/contribute.html
Select a specific anchor : Setup MXNet for Development [https://mxnet.apache.org/community/contribute.html#setup-mxnet-for-development]
It takes you here

But it's supposed to show you this

This looks like an easy fix and improves usability as anchor tags will start behaving correctly [rather than user having to scroll up to adjust the screen].
