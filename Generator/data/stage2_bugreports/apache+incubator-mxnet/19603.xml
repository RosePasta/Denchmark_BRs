	<summary>[v1.x] six/astroid dependency conflict broke lint</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

lint is broken for v1.x due to a dependency conflict between six and astroid.
Example log: &lt;denchmark-link:https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/rest/organizations/jenkins/pipelines/mxnet-validation/pipelines/sanity/branches/PR-19601/runs/2/nodes/39/steps/80/log/?start=0&gt;https://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/rest/organizations/jenkins/pipelines/mxnet-validation/pipelines/sanity/branches/PR-19601/runs/2/nodes/39/steps/80/log/?start=0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is causing  to fail for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19601&gt;#19601&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (v1.x) but pass for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/19602&gt;#19602&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 this also affects the master branch (but is not obvious thanks to docker cache). A simple fix is updating the six dependency specification to be in line with astroid
