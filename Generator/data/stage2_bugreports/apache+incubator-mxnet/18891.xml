&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the build from source guide &lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/versions/1.6/get_started/osx_setup&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I need to copy the file make/osx.mk as ./config.mk. However, there seems to be no directory called make?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Error Message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;f8ffc22b2d38:mxnet yixiaxia$     cp make/osx.mk ./config.mk
cp: make/osx.mk: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 we deprecated Makefile on master branch in favor of the new CMake build that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/leezu&gt;@leezu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 helped revamping. The instruction can be found in &lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/build_from_source&gt;https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/build_from_source&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 you're reading the instructions for MXNet 1.6 (look the upper right corner of the website). The instructions will work for 1.6. If you want to build master version, then select master version of website.
As this is a version mismatch issue, I'm closing the issue. But feel free to re-open or comment if there are more issues
