Seems like the compilation is hanging.

 Are you still seeing the same issue in your PRs? We tried to look into the logs in the provided build and there seems very little useful information there. If we do not have data points showing we consistently hit the same issue, it can be some intermittent infrastructure (ec2, networking, etc) issues.
