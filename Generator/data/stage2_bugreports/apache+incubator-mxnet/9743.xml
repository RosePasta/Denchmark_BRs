	<summary>from tensorboard import SummaryWriter wrong</summary>
	<description>
this file https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/contrib/tensorboard.py does not work any more,
because new tensorboard does not have a Class named SummaryWrite in writer.py
how could I use tensorboard now?

		It's not hard to handle the tensorboard summary with python code,  &lt;denchmark-link:http://shuokay.com/deeplabv3/&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is an example:
train_writer = SummaryWriter(cfg.train_logdir)
eval_writer = SummaryWriter(cfg.eval_logdir)
train_writer.add_scalar("loss", train_mloss, count)
train_writer.add_scalar("miou", train_miou, count)
eval_writer.add_scalar("loss", eval_mloss, count)
eval_writer.add_scalar("miou", eval_miou, count)

		tensorboard has been changed to refer to the TensorFlow's TensorBoard in PyPI.

 has been merged?
