	<summary>mxnet=1.6.0 for OSX on pypi does not work</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It seems that mxnet 1.6.0 was published on pypi: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/mxnet/1.6.0/&gt;https://pypi.org/project/mxnet/1.6.0/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, when installing it through pip on a mac, I receive this error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; import mxnet as mx
 no suitable image found.  Did find:
	/Users/fhieber/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so: unknown file type, first eight bytes: 0x7F 0x45 0x4C 0x46 0x02 0x01 0x01 0x00

		Seems the linux wheels are labeled wrongly and claim support for all platforms: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/mxnet/1.6.0/#files&gt;https://pypi.org/project/mxnet/1.6.0/#files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks, installing mxnet now works, but mxnet-mkl still shows the same problem.
It might also be useful to update the package description to include a mention of the recently added Cuda 10.2 version and remove older versions.

Good question, it would be good to know if that is the case.

 for 1.6 refers to MKLDNN enabled build.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16899&gt;#16899&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was recently merged to master branch and in the future  build will come with MKLDNN enabled by default.
