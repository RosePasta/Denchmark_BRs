	<summary>Caffe converter shortcomings with Crop, Eltwise, Slice layers</summary>
	<description>
I am converting network models from Caffe to MXNet using the convert_symbol.py conversion tool. The tool fails to properly convert several types of layers:


Caffe Crop layer: the converter ignores the "offset" parameters, and sets "center_crop=TRUE". Caffe crop does not do crop-to-center, even when no offset parameters are specified. Rather, Caffe defaults to offset values of zero (crop-to-corner).


Caffe Eltwise layer: the converter ignores the "operation" parameter, and converts any Eltwise layer to mx.symbol.broadcast_add, even though the Caffe operation may be PROD or MAX.


Caffe Slice layer: unsupported by the converter.

 Could you share the model with which you saw this issue? And any other script/data that you used, would be helpful.
