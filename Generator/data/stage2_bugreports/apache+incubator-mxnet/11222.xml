	<summary>Bug in gluon.block.Block.LoadParams</summary>
	<description>
The following code is in the LoadParams function:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    for name in loaded:
        if not ignore_extra and name not in params:
            raise ValueError(
                "Parameter '%s' loaded from file '%s' is not present in ParameterDict, " \
                "which contains parameters %s. Set ignore_extra=True to ignore. "%(
                    name, filename, _brief_print_list(self._params.keys())))
        params[name]._load_init(loaded[name], ctx)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Apparently this code is buggy if name is in loaded but not in params.
The last line should be changed to:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        if name in params:
            params[name]._load_init(loaded[name], ctx)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Just summarizing the issue for simplifying:
if name is not in params and ignore_extra=True
This line is executed, which it should not-&gt; params[name]._load_init(loaded[name], ctx)
