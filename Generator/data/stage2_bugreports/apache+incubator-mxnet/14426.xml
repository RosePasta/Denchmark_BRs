	<summary>mx.random.seed with ctx failures on a gpu build when run with cpu context</summary>
	<description>
Minimum reproducible example.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import mxnet as mx

def set_seed_variously_for_context(ctx, init_seed, num_init_seeds, final_seed):
    end_seed = init_seed + num_init_seeds
    for seed in range(init_seed, end_seed):
        mx.random.seed(seed, ctx=ctx)
    z = mx.random.seed(seed, ctx=ctx)
    return end_seed

dtype = 'float32'

samples_imp = []
samples_sym = []
ctx = mx.cpu()
shape = (200, 200)
params = {'low': -1.5, 'high': 3.0}
params.update(shape=shape, dtype=dtype)
seed = set_seed_variously_for_context(ctx, 1, 1, 1234)
mx.nd.waitall()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To reproduce, this will require the exception handling support for waitall in this PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14397&gt;#14397&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . This issue was found because of CI failures when running test_random.py on windows. It was hidden earlier because waitall didnt have exception rethrow support. This issue may have been around since the PR was added: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10367&gt;#10367&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Currently working on fixing this.
