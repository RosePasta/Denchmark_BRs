Hi there,
I found the bug of MXEnginePushAsyncND and MXEnginePushSyncND, whose argument should be an array pointer of NDArrayHandle. The bug was introduced in v1.5.0 release.
I have fixed it in the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15751&gt;#15751&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
