		Note: NDAbs also does not appear on the beta site at all... which is interesting...
The source is here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/optimizer/optimizer.py#L28&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/optimizer/optimizer.py#L28&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Or more likely:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/optimizer/optimizer.py#L39&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/optimizer/optimizer.py#L39&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It does not appear in the autosummary and is not listed in the docs for a signature to be provided.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/optimization/optimization.html?highlight=ndabs#the-mxnet-optimizer-package&gt;https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/optimization/optimization.html?highlight=ndabs#the-mxnet-optimizer-package&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the API Reference section, automodule is generating all members of optimizer, so this must be where it is coming from.
Using this may fix it:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;:exclude-members: NDAbs
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But we also need to see why this doesn't appear on beta.

		So where should NDabs be? I only see it mentioned twice in the code as some way to call abs. Is there a good reason for that? Why not just import it as abs so Sphinx doesn't try to include it... or set it up so Sphinx can document it?

  should be under NDArray API.

I am not sure of this.
