	<summary>Code raises error at CPU run but works fine with GPU</summary>

This is what I got as error message. Any help would be appreciated.

An fatal error occurred in asynchronous engine operation. If you do not know what caused this error, you can try set environment variable MXNET_ENGINE_TYPEto NaiveEngine and run with debugger (i.e. gdb). This will force all operations to be synchronous and backtrace will give you the series of calls that lead to this error. Remember to set MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE back to empty after debugging.

		was due to a problem of using CuDNN while not checking the tmp_norm

We need to fix implementation of LRN to simply use consistent outputs as in CuDNN.

 Have this problem be solved? I encountered this today. Or is there a way to work around?

		Hello ,I just got this error. And I solved by running it with cpu other than gpu .
because my device is macbook with Intel Iris Graph Card ,and  cuda is not supported yet.
