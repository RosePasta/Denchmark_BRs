	<summary>[Bug] There are two broken links on the top level README.md file which point to the old CI</summary>
	<description>
The top level README.md has two links to logos that point to builds.apache.org which is now deprecated. These must point to the new CI
This should be fixed similar to this PR - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9908&gt;#9908&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I think these icons were coming from this plugin: &lt;denchmark-link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Embeddable+Build+Status+Plugin&gt;https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Embeddable+Build+Status+Plugin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/marcoabreu&gt;@marcoabreu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Do you know if the new CI has this plugin? If not, what is the effort involved in installing it?
