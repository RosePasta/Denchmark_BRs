	<summary>Gluon DataLoader cannot release the processes in the pool</summary>
	<description>



incubator-mxnet/python/mxnet/gluon/data/dataloader.py


        Lines 532 to 533
      in

 self._worker_pool = multiprocessing.Pool( 



 self._num_workers, initializer=_worker_initializer, initargs=[self._dataset]) 





Logically, when a DataLoader is recycled, the _worker_pool should be recycled, and the terminate() of the _worker_pool function should be called immediately. However, it did not ...
Each time I kill a DataLoader, it leaves the worker processes dangling.
I guess it is a bug of python multiprocess.Pool. Anyway, I think we can patch it by explicitly call _worker_pool.terminate()
Minimum code to reproduce the errors.
import mxnet as mx
import numpy as np
A=np.random.rand(999, 2000)
D=mx.gluon.data.DataLoader(A, batch_size=8, num_workers=2)
the_iter = iter(D)
next(the_iter)
del the_iter
del D
I recorded a video demo for this bug: &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q4CmU_F1vAtxoZ_KUmrIEfVRk3RsQfv8&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q4CmU_F1vAtxoZ_KUmrIEfVRk3RsQfv8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Environment: today's mxnet from pip, python3.6 on p3

 Seems like it's caused by jupyter since it may cache the sessions?
I've tried it in terminal and the processes are gabage collected just fine.

 Okay, I found the problem is present on linux but not mac.
As discussed offline, it's better to secure the terminate manually, I will file a PR regarding this.

 Great. Thanks!
FYI, I tested it on my Mac using anaconda Python3.6. It also caused problems. Maybe caused by the anaconda version of python?

 Confirmed this as a python bug: &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.python.org/issue34172&gt;https://bugs.python.org/issue34172&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
