&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried to build MXNet(tag 1.6.0) from source,but failed each time after Running: OpWrapperGenerator.py.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Error Message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

[ 93%] Built target mxnet
Running: OpWrapperGenerator.py
Segmentation fault: 11
make[2]: *** [cpp-package/CMakeFiles/cpp_package_op_h.dir/build.make:59: cpp-package/CMakeFiles/cpp_package_op_h] Error 255

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ubuntu 19.10, CUDA 10.2, OpenCV 4.2
gcc/g++ version is 7.4.0,build with c++14.
I chose USE_CPP_PACKAGE, set BLAS to MKL and CPU runtime to TBB.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;What have you tried to solve it?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

1.I switched BLAS from openblas to MKL because of issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11543&gt;#11543&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but it doesn't work.

		After switching to MKL, you may run into &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17641&gt;#17641&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you try deleting 3rdparty/openmp to see if the segfault is due to conflict between llvm openmp and intel openmp?

You're right.Build finished after 3rdparty/openmp removed,.Thank you for your support!
