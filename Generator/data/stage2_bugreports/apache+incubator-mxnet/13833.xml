		Can we disable this until it's fixed?  It's failing the majority of the builds &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commits/master&gt;https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commits/master&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I have tried, but the status is not being reported:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13841&gt;#13841&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I expected it to report success. Other than that this change should disable it.

		Hanging of status result on successful builds was something I reported quite a while ago... you just need to restart that job and maybe it'll go through. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13714&gt;#13714&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I don't think anyone has looked at the underlying problem yet as there were no responses to the issue.
