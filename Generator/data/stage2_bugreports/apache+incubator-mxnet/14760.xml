	<summary>upcasting accumulation type in norm increases loss/Perplexity</summary>
	<description>
While fixing an issue described &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14722&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I applied the changes from master and found that the change from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14616&gt;#14616&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 follows the same pattern as the softmax change in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14098&gt;#14098&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and increases the loss and hence perpelity from 126.66 to 135, without this change and the fix to softmax &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14759&gt;#14759&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, validation perplexity comes back to 126.66
Details on how to test are provided in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14722&gt;#14722&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Backward incompatibility is a concern. What about adding env var like MXNET_ENFORCE_SAFE_ACCUMULATION = 1 to trigger safe accumulation with higher precision on existing ops?

		If we have to do this for many operators it makes sense to control through a environment variable like you are suggesting. how many operators need this change?
What i am puzzled about is why the loss goes up when the accumulation precision is increased.

		We need this for softmax, log_softmax, norm and layernorm (coming soon).

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ptrendx&gt;@ptrendx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 what do you guys think is the best way to handle this?

		Can we avoid adding another env variable ? We can accumulate only when dtype is set otherwise use the default behavior before this change was added. Also I understand FP16 inputs with accumulation in FP32 for softmax but does this also apply to FP32 inputs with accumulation in FP64. Will there be no accuracy loss ?

		Should be fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14830&gt;#14830&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
