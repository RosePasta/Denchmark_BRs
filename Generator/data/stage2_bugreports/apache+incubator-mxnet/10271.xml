	<summary>MxNet S3 driver sometimes fails to read even after 50 retries</summary>
	<description>
MxNet 1.0 SSD branch compiled from source
make -j $(nproc) USE_OPENCV=1 USE_BLAS=openblas USE_CUDA=1 USE_CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda USE_CUDNN=1 USE_DIST_KVSTORE=1 USE_S3=1
fails to read from S3 even after 50 retries. Restarting the program after crash works without any problem, so it does not appear to be a problem with S3.
Here is the stack trace
