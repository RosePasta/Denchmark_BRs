&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The way the new condition's calculation that was introduced in v1.1.2 in the operator does not take into account recent transitions.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We should think about a better heuristic to categorize the operations' states without storing every change.
