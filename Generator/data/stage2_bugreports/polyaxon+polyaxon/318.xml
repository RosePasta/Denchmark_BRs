	<summary>experiment/metrics page loads very slowly, possibly due to lots of data</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Currently I'm outputting training loss values etc. per every iteration, and displaying the metrics becomes painfully slow for about 10k iterations and more (100k iters takes insanely long).
Is there a way to mitigate the load time or should I just output fewer data points?

		I agree, the current component is not very well optimized, and the rerendering part is very slow. There's also an issue with the underlying library, plotly, that gets also slow.
I think for now you should limit the amount of data points you log during the training until we find a better approach.
