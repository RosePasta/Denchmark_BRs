&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Flyout mode for runs is not taking expanding on full screen.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261626/86377344-84ee3800-bc88-11ea-9282-711a4480fc14.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Start some runs, and go to the runs (jobs, services, dags, parallel), and enable full screen mode.
View a run in flyout mode.
Notice the issue.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261626/86377608-d26aa500-bc88-11ea-9c49-580e7163fccd.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The flyout mode should expand to the full length of the  screen, the solution is quite easy, but I am not sure why that css snippet was made in the first place.
I think the best solution is to keep the css in-place and disable it for full screen mode.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

UI v1.1.0.
But the issue is also noticeable in v1.0.86, so I think it was introduced somewhere between &gt; v1.0.8 and &lt; v1.0.86.
