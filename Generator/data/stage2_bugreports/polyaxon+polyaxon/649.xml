	<summary>Sorting experiments in descending order</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I would like to take a look at the temporarily best validation score.
Let's assume. I scheduled N experiments in the HP tuning. There are finished M experiments, where M is lower than N. Sorting experiments by metric in ascending order works well, but descending order prefers experiments with Created status.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31375424/71995855-855ac880-323b-11ea-87e3-b38407b7701a.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Schedule N experiments in HP search.
Wait until M experiments are finished, but N &lt;&lt; M.
Add any column to the table in the experiments view.
Sort values by any column in the descending column.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

All experiments that haven't been run should be pushed down.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		There's probably a default order by at code/db level, it should be removed then.

		Well, I just noticed that I can solve it by filtering out experiments using Succeded status in Searches button, but it's not very convenient.
