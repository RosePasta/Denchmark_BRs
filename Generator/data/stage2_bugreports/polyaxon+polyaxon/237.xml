		That's something I noticed before as well, if you have an issue and you want to debug it, you can use the --ttl=NUMBER_IN_SECONDS, e.g. --ttl=60 to keep the resource for one minute while you check what's wrong with the failing job.

		Closing this issue, it was already solved, because logs collection behaviour has changed.
