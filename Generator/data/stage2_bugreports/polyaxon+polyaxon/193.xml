	<summary>Experiment groups with only discrete spaces and larger number of experiments requested don't create experiments</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Hi All, Has anyone had issues with deploying a group of experiments in a hp tunning fashion which deployed ok and stated to be "running" but there are no experiments in the "Experiments" tab?


We had to restart rabbitmq to be able to start new groups

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Start an experiment group with the following polyaxonfile.
hptuning:
  concurrency: 10
  random_search:
    n_experiments: 10

  matrix:
    dropout:
      values: [0.25, 0.3]
    activation:
      values: [relu, sigmoid]
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Polyaxon should start the group with the maximum possible experiments (total space) without trying to sample more experiments than possible, ideally, a check should be in place when only discrete values are passed.
This behavior impacts the whole hptuning service, so no more groups are created, because all CPU is consumed by the sampling.
