	<summary>Repo FileNotFoundError/Log FileNotFoundError</summary>
	<description>
My deployment is on aws kubernetes cluster. The experiment running failed due to FileNotExist. Here's the log for scheduler container:
[2018-04-20 02:49:05,979: INFO/MainProcess] Received task: experiments_build[f731be9d-3efd-43da-a36b-348a3292165d]  ETA:[2018-04-20 02:49:06.951478+00:00]  [2018-04-20 02:49:07,121: ERROR/ForkPoolWorker-2] Celery Task Failed Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/celery/app/trace.py", line 374, in trace_task R = retval = fun(*args, **kwargs) File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/celery/app/trace.py", line 629, in __protected_call__ return self.run(*args, **kwargs) File "/polyaxon/polyaxon/experiments/tasks.py", line 61, in build_experiment status = experiments_builder.build_experiment(experiment) File "/polyaxon/polyaxon/dockerizer/builders/experiments.py", line 117, in build_experiment env_vars=experiment_spec.run_exec.env_vars) File "/polyaxon/polyaxon/dockerizer/builders/experiments.py", line 46, in __init__ dockerfile_name=dockerfile_name) File "/polyaxon/polyaxon/dockerizer/builders/base.py", line 47, in __init__ self.build_repo_path = self.create_tmp_repo() File "/polyaxon/polyaxon/dockerizer/builders/base.py", line 61, in create_tmp_repo return copy_to_tmp_dir(self.repo_path, os.path.join(self.image_tag, self.folder_name)) File "/polyaxon/polyaxon/libs/paths.py", line 48, in copy_to_tmp_dir shutil.copytree(path, tmp_path) File "/usr/lib/python3.5/shutil.py", line 303, in copytree names = os.listdir(src) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/repos/root/quick-start/quick-start' 
I check the file in scheduler container and find the code path is /repos/quick-start/quick-start instead of /repos/root/quick-start/quick-start.
After I create root dir under /repos and move files into this path, the experiment status is 'starting' and the scheduler keeps printing:
[2018-04-20 03:35:30,857: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-2] Publishing log event for task: None.None, root.q-s.8 INFO 2018-04-20 03:35:30,977 publisher 12 139964421228288 Publishing log event for task: None.None, root.q-s.8 [2018-04-20 03:35:30,977: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-2] Publishing log event for task: None.None, root.q-s.8 INFO 2018-04-20 03:35:31,109 publisher 12 139964421228288 Publishing log event for task: None.None, root.q-s.8 [2018-04-20 03:35:31,109: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-2] Publishing log event for task: None.None, root.q-s.8 INFO 2018-04-20 03:35:31,234 publisher 12 139964421228288 Publishing log event for task: None.None, root.q-s.8 [2018-04-20 03:35:31,234: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-2] Publishing log event for task: None.None, root.q-s.8
And the log for worker container shows it can't find file /logs/root/quick-start/independents/8 (This is the 8th experiment I run). Here's the log:
[2018-04-20 03:34:26,919: ERROR/ForkPoolWorker-1] Celery Task Failed Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/celery/app/trace.py", line 374, in trace_task R = retval = fun(*args, **kwargs) File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/celery/app/trace.py", line 629, in __protected_call__ return self.run(*args, **kwargs) File "/polyaxon/polyaxon/events/tasks.py", line 92, in handle_events_job_logs log_handler = logging.FileHandler(log_path) File "/usr/lib/python3.5/logging/__init__.py", line 1008, in __init__ StreamHandler.__init__(self, self._open()) File "/usr/lib/python3.5/logging/__init__.py", line 1037, in _open return open(self.baseFilename, self.mode, encoding=self.encoding) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/logs/root/quick-start/independents/8'
So I create the dir /logs/root/quick-start/indenpendents and the experiment seems to work fine.

		Ok I really need to investigate this further because it seems very related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/issues/98&gt;#98&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I don't think this issue is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/issues/98&gt;#98&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 because the upload is successful. What's wrong is the file path. Does username recently become part of the  ?
