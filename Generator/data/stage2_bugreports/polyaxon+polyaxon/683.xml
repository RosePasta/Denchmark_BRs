	<summary>Erroneous GET request for `#` in directory name</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If an experiment creates a output sub-directory with a name that includes a #, the subsequent GET request from the client to the API is cut at the char before the # and the client only sees the status "Loading"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Full Output Directory path:  /api/v1/user/project/experiments/123/outputs/dirname_#3/
clicking on the subdirectory dirname_#3 the contents of the directory is not resolved and the status "loading..." is perpetually shown.
polyaxon-api logs show:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING 2020-02-27 16:57:07,908 log 5299 140424238085888 Bad Request: /api/v1/user/project/experiments/123/outputs/tree

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I would expect to be able to resolve all directory names that can be used in linux
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Paths are passed as query params in v1, so I assume it won't have this issue.
