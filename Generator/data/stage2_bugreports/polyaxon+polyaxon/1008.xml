	<summary>Client `download_artifact` is passing the `force` flag to the store manager</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Just wanted to check in to see if anyone else is facing an issue with RunClient().download_artifact()
I would be happy to create an issue and propose or PR some changes should this be a genuine issue, but want to clear it with the community.  When we attempt to pull artifacts this way (V1.1.7) we get an error indicating that download_file is not expecting the force kwarg:
TypeError: download() got an unexpected keyword argument 'force'

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Seems like the force flag was passed to the store manager as well as the url. The error did not surface in other services using the store manager, because they do not use the client for that.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Not sure if the store manager should have any specific handling for the force flag itself. But in any case the force flag should removed from the kwargs
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

v1.1.7
