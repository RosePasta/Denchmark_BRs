	<summary>Readme editor's text input div in dashboard not filling the entire parent div.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The dashboard's Readme editor do not let you click to edit within the entire text box only the first line. I believe this worked as expected a couple of months ago but I could be wrong.
It seems to be the this div that does not fill the entire parent div.
div.react-mde.react-mde-tabbed-layout div.mde-text div.DraftEditor-root div.DraftEditor-editorContainer div.notranslate.public-DraftEditor-content
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Try to edit an experiment or project Readme text.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

One can click inside the entire text field to start entering text not only a small part of it.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Polyaxon 0.4.0 with Firefox 66.0b10
