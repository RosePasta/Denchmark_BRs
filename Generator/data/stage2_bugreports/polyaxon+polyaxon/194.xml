	<summary>Error while uploading projects with big files</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have a project with jupyter notebooks, which are around 1.5Mb. Polyaxon fails when uploading this files with an error: 413 Request Entity Too Large
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create a project with a big file as a jupyter notebook. Try to upload the code.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The jupyter notebook should be uploaded as code. It might be more interesting throw a warning and asking you if you are sure of uploading a big file instead of failing. I like the fact it tells me that I am uploading something big and it might be wrond doing it, but at the same time it limits what you can do with notebooks.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
