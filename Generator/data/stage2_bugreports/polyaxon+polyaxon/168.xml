	<summary>Data and outputs settings validation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Config parsing is currently not robust and fails silently, letting erroneous settings to be used by the platform.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Providing this data persistence config:
persistence:
  data:
    mountPath: "/data/2"
    existingClaim: "data-2-pvc"
Will pass silently and raise Attribute issues during the scheduling.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The platform should notify the user that the settings is wrong. Ideally, a parser should be used before deploying the platform.

		Cluster will raise ConfigurationError and won't be able to deploy in case of wrong data/outputs configuration.
