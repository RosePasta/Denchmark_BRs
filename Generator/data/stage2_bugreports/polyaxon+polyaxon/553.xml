	<summary>Resumed experiments no longer resume</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We recently upgraded from Polyaxon 0.5.4 to 0.5.5, and our resume function has stopped working. When I say stopped working, from the UI, it says resumed, but it has not appeared to have copied the outputs from the experiment it has resumed for, and hence we get a restarting behaviour. I have confirmed that in Polyaxon 0.5.4 we do not have this issue by rolling back our deployment to check, however due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/issues/544&gt;#544&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we have reverted back to 0.5.5. For now we are using a work around for resuming experiments of
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;polyaxon experiment -xp &lt;id&gt; restart --copy
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Resume an experiment that requires the outputs of the experiment it is resuming from to resume i.e a checkpoint file
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As per Polyaxon 0.5.4, experiment resumes
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Polyaxon 0.5.5
GKE
Google Filestore for outputs

		Sorry about this regression, I can confirm that it is fixed now.
A new patch v0.5.6 will be released in the next 2 days.
