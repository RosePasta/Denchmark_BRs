	<summary>Logging outside of cluster managed by Polyaxon</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Unclear documentation&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the documentation, it is mentioned that we can logs outside of a cluster managed by Polyaxon ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.polyaxon.com/references/polyaxon-tracking-api/other-environments/&gt;https://docs.polyaxon.com/references/polyaxon-tracking-api/other-environments/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
However, it is not working for me, the logs doesn't seems to be stored on the server (I tried 2 configuration, storing at the default location and at a S3 server).
I tried to upload logs manually for debugging and when it sends logs (send_logs function in experiment.py), the request seems to return 200 (line 270) although I cannot see it in the ui or in the file system.
Note that logging is working with managed experiments (polyaxon run -f config.yml).
Did I missed something (like an environment variable to set)?

		That was a regression.
A fix will be part of v0.5.5.
