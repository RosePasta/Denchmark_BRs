	<summary>Downloading csv from TensorBoard</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In tensorboards running on polyaxon, attempting to download a csv gives a "file not found" error even though downloading json works. This seems to be a problem with polyaxon - when downloading the experiment outputs and running a local version of tensorboard, the csv files can be opened correctly.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Open a tensorboard in the polyaxon dashboard, enable 'show data download link', select an experiment in any graph and press "csv".
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Download a csv.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Polyaxon 0.5.6, TensorFlow 1.14

		Just an update on this issue since I am checking all tensorboard related issues, the proxy gateway has change in v1 to allow more flexibility and it should work for all type of requests, the auth mechanism is implement as subrequest, unfortunately it won't be possible to implement this in v0, so I am just going to tag this as in-v1.
