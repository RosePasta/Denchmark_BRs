	<summary>Ghost tensorboard pods after project deletion</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Might be a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/issues/526&gt;#526&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When projects get deleted ternsorboard pods keep running but unreachable from polyaxon.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We had many projects that had tensorboards running (&gt;250) and then we deleted all the projects automatically (using this awful command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl get pods -n polyaxon --show-labels | \
grep dummy | grep Running | grep tensorboard | \
perl -lne 'print $1 if /project_name=dummy-jobs.(.*-smoke_test-.*),p/' | \
xargs -n 1 -I {} sh -c "yes | \
polyaxon project -p {} delete"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We expected that deleting a project also kills the tensorboard and it did so for about 100 out of the 250.
However the other 150 kept running (pods were running and tensorboard were reachable) but were unreachable from polyaxon (polyaxon tensorboard -p  didn't show any output), hence couldn't be deleted.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

k8s: 1.13.4
polyaxon:0.4.4

		I think this bug will be solved automatically once the operator is GA, an initial version will be part of the v0.6.
