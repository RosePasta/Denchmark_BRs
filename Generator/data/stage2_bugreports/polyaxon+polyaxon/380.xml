	<summary>Failed to fetch logs: Transport endpoint is not connected</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I trained a model and logs are displayed properly in the beginning. After the training (~2 days), I checked back again, and it has issue fetching the logs.
These are the error logs from the API server.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[pid: 66247|app: 0|req: 9212/36807] 10.244.0.1 () {46 vars in 1161 bytes} [Mon Feb 25 01:48:01 2019] GET /api/v1/root/drone_maskrcnn/experiments/53/logs =&gt; generated 1341 bytes in 131 msecs (HTTP/1.1 500) 4 headers in 151 bytes (1 switches on core 0)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Not sure how to reproduce it since it's the first time it happened and nothing was done.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

See logs on dashboard. If disconnected, the server should reestablish the connections.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		More info is needed, namely the environment, what version are you running, what type of persistence are you using for the logs?
In any case this &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.polyaxon.com/configuration/custom-logs-storage/&gt;section&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could be useful. I also added a new &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.polyaxon.com/faq/i-cannot-fetch-logs/&gt;faq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to mention cases when this could happen.

		we resolved it by restarting the servers. I think our kubernetes cluster had some network issues then we started getting this error. Not sure how to reproduce tho.
