	<summary>polyaxon upload fails most of the time, but not always</summary>
	<description>
I've spent a while trying to figure this out, because I suspected it was a misconfiguration in my cluster.
Most of the time when I run polyaxon upload, the upload fails, with an error 504 saying that there was an internal timeout. Sometimes it succeeds, however --- but only after waiting quite a while after the progress has completed.
I've looked through the logs for the API, and I've noticed that uwsgi is complaining that threading isn't enabled. It's also launching 4 workers, while the process limit for the container is less than 1 CPU. I'm not sure whether any of this is relevant. I tried increasing the CPU limit for the pod to 3 CPUs, which didn't help. Changing the timeout in the client also didn't affect anything.
The upload still times out even when the upload is very small (say, 100kb).

		Awesome, thanks. Let me know if it'd help to have an account on our cluster.

		Did you have a chance to test this issue with the new release, let me know if it's still happening, I was not able to reproduce this very specific issue, but I fixed some, probably, related issues.
