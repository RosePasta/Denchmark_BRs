	<summary>Jobs get stuck in building</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Jobs never get out of the building stage if there is a temporary error in the scheduler. The affected jobs look like:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7347808/81828518-dc351f00-9507-11ea-873b-050066a5db1f.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Newer jobs than this one get scheduled, but this one remains stuck in this stage. Looking at the scheduler logs shows that there was an error connecting to Postgres slightly before this experiment was created.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create a connection error within the scheduler, then create a new job.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This job gets scheduled once the scheduler is back up.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Polyaxon 0.5.6
Kubernetes 1.13.4
