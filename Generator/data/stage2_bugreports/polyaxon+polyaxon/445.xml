		This sounds like a bug, what type of experiment group are you running?

		I think I am going to close this as it's not relevant to the new system. We removed the concurrency from the core, it's now only handled by the agent/queue system, most of these issues were coming from race condition in the open source version because workers were accessing to the same global queue asynchronously, and some events get lost.
Hopefully way less of these issues moving forward.
