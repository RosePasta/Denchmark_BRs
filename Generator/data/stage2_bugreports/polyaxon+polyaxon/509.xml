	<summary>Sort by metrics doesn't work at polyaxon 0.5.1</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried to sort by a metrics in a experiment group on the web UI, but it doesn't work. I attached a part of screenshot of it.
I tried to sort f1_micro which is a metric. But those are not sorted as I expected.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1523515/61317780-8c3ade00-a7b8-11e9-88d4-db8b8280b272.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Run a experiment group whose experiments log metrics.
Go to the page.
Sort experiments by a certain metric.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Experiments in a experiment groupu should be sorted by a specified key.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


polyaxon: 0.5.1

		The field was changed to metrics but the api was not updated with a proxy to the underlaying db field. Since the API has a backward compatibility with the field metric as well, tests were passing  but the actual logic would only proxy metric and not metrics.
This was a regression and tests were only updated before for the filtering and not sorting.
The proxy field is added to the sorting logic, and tests are updated to check also for metrics as well.
Closing the issue, a fix for this regression will be available for v0.5.5.
