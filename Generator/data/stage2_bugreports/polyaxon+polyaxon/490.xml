	<summary>Not all experiments are shown in online dashboard</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Experiments are not all shown in the polyaxon dashboard. It seems to be a bug with the "Next" button in the view displaying the experiments table.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I ran a group of 192 experiments. The online dashboard only shows 6 pages of 20 experiments (so, 120 experiments, missing 72) and then the "Next" button greys out. On the other hand, I can access all experiments from the command line without any problem (9 pages of 20 and 1 page of 12).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Have all experiments displayed in the dashboard.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

polyaxon 0.4.4

		I think this is fixed in later versions of Polyaxon, definitely fixed in v1.
0.4.4 is very old.
