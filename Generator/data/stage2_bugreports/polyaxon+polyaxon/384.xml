	<summary>Failed to complete entire experiment group</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Created an experiment group to stress my polyaxon deployment a bit and almost all completed correctly but two experiments failed to get a "completed" state.
One got stuck in a "started" state although it seems to have completed correctly. According to the statuses tab it never managed to leave the "starting" state after the "scheduled" state.
The other one failed to start with a strange error.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"Failure","message":"pods \"plxjob-master0-6a83acd8af084000b21bf158a7b0aae2\" already exists"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Here it is in full.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

All 50 experiments completing successfully. But I am impressed with version 0.4.0 of Polyaxon so far! I just wanted to give a heads up about this strange error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Polyaxon 0.4.0 on Kubernetes 1.11.7 deployed with kubespray. Running 13 nodes in the cluster but in the polyaxon namespace there are two CPU nodes and two GPU nodes (1+4 GPUs in total).

		I have seen this, happends due to concurrency, a solution is underwork, did you manage to reproduce it more than once?

		<comment id='2' author='AntonFriberg' date='2019-02-26T19:00:35Z'>
		I have not yet managed to reproduce it but will let you now if I do! Thanks!

		<comment id='3' author='AntonFriberg' date='2019-02-28T09:03:25Z'>
		Created 12 more realistic long running experiments and did not see any strange behavior.

		I have been conducting stress tests on large number of experiment groups on 0.4.3 and 0.4.4 with the different algorithms proposed by the platform, and all tests went through.
I am closing this for now, hopefully noone will encounter this issue again.
