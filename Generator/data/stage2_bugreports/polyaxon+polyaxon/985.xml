&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Table comparison is not adapting to the parent container beyond 20 runs per page.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Table should scroll with fixed header.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

v1.1.7-rc0, but the regression seems to go back to v1.1.5.

		Seems like a PR to the react library that caused the regression has been made, hopefully it will be merged during this week. I am assigning this issue to v1.1.8 in the meantime.
