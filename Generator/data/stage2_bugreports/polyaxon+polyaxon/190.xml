	<summary>Polyaxon does not enable a disabled node after removing and readding again</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


I removed and added again the same node in the k8s cluster (first kubeadm reset and then kubeadm join on that node), the corresponding pods were created correctly, but in the database flag Is_current was left to False, so I have manually changed it to True.
Maybe I didn't wait enough to change it automatically to True ?

		If it helps, just to let you know:
I have tested this again. I have removed one node from the cluster (on the master: kubectl drain &lt;NODE_NAME&gt; --delete-local-data --force --ignore-daemonsets and kubectl delete nodes &lt;NODE_NAME&gt;, on the node: kubeadm reset), added it back again (on the node kubeadm join ...) and waited for more than one hour but Polyaxon didn't recognize it. So I had to manually change the Is_current flag to true.
