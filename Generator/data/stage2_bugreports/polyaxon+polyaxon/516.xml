	<summary>Possibly invalid hparam.matrix schema validation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;hptuning:
    matrix:
        param:
            normal: 66.0:30.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

gets me the following output when running polyaxon check:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Polyaxonfile is not valid.
Error message `{'hptuning': {'normal': ['scale value must strictly higher that loc value, received instead loc: 66.0, scale: 30.0']}}`.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think the cause of that issue is this line, where for any type of range, a check is being made that second arg must be greater than the first one which is not the case for  ranges:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-schemas/blob/7a052826bfa29607af0da48c8e512461523deeca/polyaxon_schemas/ops/group/matrix.py#L76&gt;https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-schemas/blob/7a052826bfa29607af0da48c8e512461523deeca/polyaxon_schemas/ops/group/matrix.py#L76&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Bonus:
It would be nice to allow 66:30 instead of forcing typing floats.

		The fix will be part of v0.5.4.
You don't need to do 66.0:30.0, I think 66:30 should work as well. I will confirm this later.

		I can confirm that 66:30 or [66, 30] or {loc: 66, scale: 30} all should work from next release.
Thanks for reporting.
