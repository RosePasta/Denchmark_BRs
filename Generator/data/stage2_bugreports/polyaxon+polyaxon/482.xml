	<summary>Temporary failure in name resolution in polyaxon-init-job</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi, I seem to be getting an issue where when I run an experiment and the polyaxon-init-job container gets:
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='polyaxon-polyaxon-api', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/v1/&lt;redacted&gt;/experiments/335526/imporsonatetoken/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('&lt;urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7f8b3121ac18&gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',))
polyaxon-polyaxon-api is the svc endpoint and is reachable by other jobs but this job always seems to fail whilst others succeed. The container lasts only a few milliseconds before it fails. I checked the /etc/resolv.conf and they seem to be there as expected but not sure why I get this temporary failure in name resolution.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run a polyaxon experiment in a busy cluster with many experiments being scheduled at the same time.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Experiment to start as expected.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Kubernetes Version: v1.13.x
Polyaxon Version: 0.4.4
CNI: Calico v3.6

		As discussed, 2 possible solutions that could solve this bug:

new restarts attribute.
a simple retry on ConnectionError in the init container.

		A retry mechanism has been added, and will be part of the coming release.
Feel free to reopen if you still see this problem after upgrading to v0.5.

		I am not sure yet why this happens, I will try to debug it before next minor release.

		The cause of the problem is how k8s manages EmptyDir. A fix is under way.
Closing the issue as it will be solved for v0.5.4.
