	<summary>Polyaxon build resources are not passed to all generated pods</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The pod security policy in my k8 cluster enforces that all pods must specify resources. According to the error I'm getting when I kick off a job the plx-build pod isn't specify resources (there may even be other pods that aren't specifying resources). I specify resources in the polyaxon file but it appears that those resources are not passed down.
Example Polyaxonfile that fails:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;version: 1
kind: build
environment:
  resources:
    cpu:
      limits: 0.5
      requests: 0.5
    memory:
      limits: 512
      requests: 256
image: 'python:3.6'
build_steps:
  - 'pip install polyaxon-client[s3]'
  - pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;HTTP response body: {"kind":"Status","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{},"status":"Failure","message":"pods \"plx-build-8a04441cd2934a9b8c5da9b45c41483d\" is forbidden: failed quota: engines-resource-quota: must specify cpu,memory","reason":"Forbidden","details":{"name":"plx-build-8a04441cd2934a9b8c5da9b45c41483d","kind":"pods"},"code":403}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For now, I'm setting defaults on resources within the polyaxon namespace.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create pod security policy that enforces that pods can only be spun up if resources are specified. Don't set a default resource value for pods that don't specify resources.
Run Polyaxon file above.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Specified resources for building should be passed to all generated pods.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Sensible resources will be set on all containers (init/sidecar) starting from next release v0.5.
Closing the issue for now.
