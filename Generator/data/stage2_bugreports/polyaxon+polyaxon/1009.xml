&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


I really like the code-server integration! However, I'm wondering if there's a way to persist the service across page reloads? If I have some work being done in a window and it crashes, the next time I try to load vs code in the browser, I've lost whatever was running (in terminal, debugging, etc). I can see the processes still in top but can't get back to them.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


this is how to replicate:


Launch code-server through Polyaxon
Run an ML training script in the vs code terminal
Let it run over the weekend
Come back to the browser and see that the tab is unresponsive
Close stuck tab and reopen
New vs code tab is clean and does not have the same terminal as before
In the new terminal, I can still see that the python training process is running with top.
I think a workaround would be for me to use tmux so I can attach to the same shell session from different vs code windows if necessary.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Enhancement&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 investigate crash
 enable auto-resume behavior: I think there is this config option basically just pointing this value to the default outputs path of the current run, it will persist all values, and provide both resume and auto-resume for preemptible/spot VMs.
 disable telemetry by default: config option
