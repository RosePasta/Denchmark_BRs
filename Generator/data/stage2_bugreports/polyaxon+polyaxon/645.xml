	<summary>How to define ENV_VARS in the setting page?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Unclear documentation&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.polyaxon.com/configuration/custom-run-environment/#env-vars&gt;https://docs.polyaxon.com/configuration/custom-run-environment/#env-vars&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


In order to set the default environment variables, you can update the ENV_VARS in the setting page for every primitive.

It is not clear in what format the environmentvariables should be defined.
When entering sth. like {'key': 'val'} the form validator complains with
Env vars configuration for build jobs
Cannot convert value {'key': 'val'} (key: ENV_VARS:BUILD_JOBS) to &lt;class 'list'&gt;
When entering [['key', 'val']] (like it works in the polyaxonfiles) the input gets converted to a string i.e. "[['key', 'val']]".
That seems to have no effect as a build step like echo "key = $key" just prints key =
So what would be the right format?

		This looks like a bug, by the way the env section has been converted to dict, it will lose some validation, but it's less confusing.
As for why the env vars are not injected, I am not completely sure, maybe it's still in the cache? do you still see the same behaviour after a couple of minutes of setting those values.
In any case I would suggest to have them on the polyaxonfiles for now.

		Usually such changes were applied within seconds, In this case I was testing for at least 30 minutes until I gave up on it. So after 30 minutes the change was apparently still not applied...?
