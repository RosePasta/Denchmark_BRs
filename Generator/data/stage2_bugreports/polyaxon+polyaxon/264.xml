&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A bug with the content of the Outputs tab.
I run an experiment, say n35, in my code I create my log.txt file, which become visible in the output of the experiment which is permanently filled. Then I run another experiment and in the Outputs tab I see my log.txt file and other files. But job is not yet scheduled. In the content of the log.txt I see the content of the previous log.txt, experiment 35.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		The reducers has much better state management, and this is fixed as a side effect of this new behavior.
