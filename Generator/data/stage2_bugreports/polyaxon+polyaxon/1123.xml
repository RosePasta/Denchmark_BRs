		We pushed a notification banner about some security issues, seems it broke the build.
We will fix the issue (upgrade the breaking packges), in the meantime you can access all documentation guides via github: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/tree/0.6.1/docs&gt;https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/tree/0.6.1/docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Sorry about that.

		I spent 3 hours this weekend to fix the issue with docs website, the problem comes from this library &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kornelski/pngquant&gt;https://github.com/kornelski/pngquant&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, upgrading the library breaks 14 other npm packages.
I think we should just announce that we will not maintain Polyaxon v0.x anymore (platform, docs, cli, clients, charts, ...), Polyaxon v0.6.x or lower versions have several outdated libraries, some of them have security issues and vulnerabilities, updating these legacy releases with newer versions of those packages and resolve changes will require more or less a week worth of time.
Polyaxon v1 is the current version we maintain, if you wish to use Polyaxon v0, I would suggest that you deploy it in a protected network only. For the docs, you can keep viewing all guides via github or on your local machine if you pull the repo and checkout to the correct release, the project and docs are open-source under Apache 2 license.

 thank you for your efforts.
Do I get it right, that &lt;denchmark-link:https://legacy-docs.polyaxon.com&gt;https://legacy-docs.polyaxon.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 won't be available anymore (as it is not at the moment)? And, if so, could you please advise on which rendering engine may be used to build the docs similarly to how they used to be accessible at &lt;denchmark-link:https://legacy-docs.polyaxon.com&gt;https://legacy-docs.polyaxon.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: i.e., searchable, with nested table of contents, etc?

		There are several projects that can consume markdown, &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mkdocs.org/&gt;Mkdocs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is a good option. You will probably need to customize the files to enable some features.
Edit: I meant to share &lt;denchmark-link:https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/&gt;mkdocs-material&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Same problem here..
You can run something like :
`#!/bin/bash
TGT=mkdocs.yml
touch $TGT
DOC_DIR=docs
echo "site_name: Polyaxon_0.61" &gt; $TGT
echo "nav: " &gt;&gt; $TGT
for rep in ${DOC_DIR}/; do
if test -d $rep; then
echo "- "basename $rep":" &gt;&gt;$TGT;
for fich in $rep/; do
echo -e "   - ${fich}" | sed s/"docs/"//g &gt;&gt; $TGT;
done ;
fi;
done
echo "theme: readthedocs" &gt;&gt; $TGT
echo "docs_dir: docs " &gt;&gt; $TGT`
and then do a
mkdocs serve -a 0.0.0.0:8000
from the 0.61 root folder but some images are missing ...

 thanks for the tip!
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mouradmourafiq&gt;@mouradmourafiq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is there a chance we can get the images from the  folder?

 I don't think we have the right to distribute some assets with an open-source license.
