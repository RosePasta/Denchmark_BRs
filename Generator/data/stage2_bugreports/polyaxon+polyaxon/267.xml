	<summary>[Bug] UI bug in outputs view</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When the outputs tree structure becomes too deep (3 with my own experience), we can not open folders and see files inside it. No matter the number of characters of each folder, the problem always appear with more than 2 nested folders.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create an experiment that produces an output with nested folders (at least 3 folders).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No matter the output tree structure, every folder should be able to be opened in order to reveal its content.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Polyaxon 0.3.1
