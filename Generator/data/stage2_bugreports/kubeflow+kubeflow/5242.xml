	<summary>Kubeflow manifests downloaded to upstream/ instead of upstream/manifests/</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
During the deployment of Kubeflow, step (&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/#configure-kubeflow&gt;Configure Kubeflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), running  got me the following output including an error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kpt cfg set ./instance gke.private false
set 0 fields
kpt cfg set ./instance mgmt-ctxt kf11-mng-clst
set 1 fields
kpt cfg set ./upstream/manifests/gcp name kf11-clst
Error: lstat upstream/manifests/gcp: no such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I checked and found it indeed as reported, upstream/manifests/gcp does't exist; gcp/ directory exists directly under upstream/. So I went ahead and took off the intermediary folder manifest/ from the all the paths under set-values.
Error solved, then I got:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kustomize build --load_restrictor none -o .build/gcp_config ./instance/gcp_config
2020/08/25 14:13:42 absolute path error in '/home/xxx/kubeflow_v1_1/management/kubeflow/upstream/manifests/gcp/v2/cnrm' : evalsymlink failure on '/home/xxx/kubeflow_v1_1/management/kubeflow/upstream/manifests/gcp/v2/cnrm' : lstat /home/xxx/kubeflow_v1_1/management/kubeflow/upstream/manifests: no such file or directory
Error: accumulating resources: accumulating resources from '../../upstream/manifests/gcp/v2/cnrm': open /home/xxx/kubeflow_v1_1/management/kubeflow/upstream/manifests/gcp/v2/cnrm: no such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I checked the Makefile again and found the manifests directory variable set MANIFESTS_DIR=./upstream/manifests, so I rolled back my previous change; namely, I put back the manifests/ after upstream/ in the paths.
Then, I manually created a folder manifests/ under upstream/, and move all the content that was directly under upstream/ to /upstream/manifests/. Then the the issue was solved and make set-values finished successfully.
What did you expect to happen:
The command make set-values to finish successfully.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): v1.1
Kubernetes platform: GKE
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.16
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
