	<summary>Cannot configure ambassador parameters on minikube</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Attempted to deploy Kubeflow on minikube, with Ambassador. The created service for the latter is configurable (default ClusterIP), howerver I could not influence the generated output. The  snippet below should configure a NodePort service, but the generated code did not reflect the change.
componentParams:
    ambassador:
    - name: ambassadorServiceType
      value: NodePort
What did you expect to happen:
Ambassador should have been deployed with a NodePort service instead of ClusterIP.

I believe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/blob/master/pkg/kfapp/minikube/minikube.go#L103&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 part of the code is to blame, as it overwrites the Ambassador component parameters with hard-coded values.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: v0.6.1
kfctl version: 3a1eb06 (master)
Kubernetes platform: minikube
Kubernetes version: v1.14.3
OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3
