/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Creating notebooks looks like it works but any connection returns a 404 error on the jupyter server. tried a bunch of different provided servers  and was only able to get the tensorflow 1.5 w/gpu image working. All other images return a webpage with a 404 error and a jupyter header. Custom images also do the same thing (tensorflow/tensorflow). I just upgraded from kubeflow v0.5 and all images I tried worked on that version.
What did you expect to happen:
Notebook launches correctly from the dashboard
Environment:

Kubeflow version: v0.6.2
kfctl version: v0.6.2-0-g47a0e4c7
Kubernetes platform: Bare-metal
Kubernetes version: 1.14.3
OS: Ubuntu 18.04

		Can you provide the docker image that you are trying, the logs of your jupyter server, and the URL you are trying to hit?

		Tested with the provided tensorflow-1.13.1-notebook-gpu:v0.5.0 and tensorflow-2.0.0a-notebook-gpu:v0.5.0 images.
So I have a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster with 1 management node and multiple gpu nodes. It looks like the first problem I had was I deployed with  instead of . After I did that my first notebook worked. Upon creating more notebooks the logs for the first notebook showed that connections for notebook &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/2&gt;#2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3&gt;#3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I created all were routed to the first notebook and thus returned a 404 since they were to wrong path. After deleting the original notebook, requests were routed properly to the second and third notebook.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SpontaneousDuck&gt;@SpontaneousDuck&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this was a bug in the notebook controller that was fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4402&gt;#4402&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The fix should be in 0.7.0 which we released this morning.
