	<summary>Qualify 0.7.0 with kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml</summary>
	<description>
We are now on 0.7.0RC7 for kfctl
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

There are currently no known P0 issues.

Opening this bug to track qualifying the kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml config.
Ideally we'd like to aim to finalize 0.7.0 today. So it would be great to do run through the deployment and identify and fix any issues that come up.
There was a bug &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4415&gt;#4415&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the registration flow in the case with no identity.
We'd like to verify that issue has been fixed.

There was a bug #4415 with the registration flow in the case with no identity.
We'd like to verify that issue has been fixed.

This is fixed. Just verified with a fresh deployment with the newest RC.

		What I've verified with this configuration:

Central Dashboard seems fine and #4415 is fixed now.
Notebooks and profiles are accessible and functional as intended
Pipelines seem to be working fine
Katib's random experiment example ran into this issue:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl logs -n kubeflow random-experiment-random-868cd68f9b-8whsf
INFO:hyperopt.utils:Failed to load dill, try installing dill via "pip install dill" for enhanced pickling support.
INFO:hyperopt.fmin:Failed to load dill, try installing dill via "pip install dill" for enhanced pickling support.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hougangliu&gt;@hougangliu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Is this expected behaviour OTS?

 the RCs look good.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4452&gt;#4452&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is a cherry-pick which needs to be merged in.
