 Can you follow &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/monitor-iap-setup/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/monitor-iap-setup/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and see where deployment failed.

		I am facing the exact same issue. I have deployed kubeflow using the UI before but this issue has never come up before.
After 20 minutes cap is reached, it ends with "Could not redirect to Kubeflow Dashboard at: .... "

		Should this help: I had a similar issue when following the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/oauth-setup&gt;OAuth setup&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 documentation. Using the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/monitor-iap-setup/&gt;Monitor IAP setup&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 procedure I was able to fix the issue which was at step 6

If you get an error Error: redirect_uri_mismatch after logging in, this means the list of OAuth authorized redirect URIs does not include your domain

In my case, when I was creating the OAuth Credential, at step 2 in the OAuth setup documentation, it is said

in the Authorized redirect URIs box, enter the following (if it‚Äôs not already present in the list of authorized redirect URIs): &gt;https://iap.googleapis.com/v1/oauth/clientIds/&lt;CLIENT_ID&gt;:handleRedirect

but we don't know yet the &lt;CLIENT_ID&gt; (I tried to enter "something" thinking it would be used as client ID but it was not. And no error occurs). So I think we should proceed in two steps :
1- First, create the OAuth Web credentials while letting the Authorized redirect URIs box empty. We then get the OAuth Client ID and secret
2- Then we can edit and update the OAuth credentials to add the Authorized redirect URIs box :
https://iap.googleapis.com/v1/oauth/clientIds/&lt;CLIENT_ID&gt;.apps.googleusercontent.com:handleRedirect
Proceeding that way, I was then able to access to my Kubeflow deployment (latest version 0.5)
I'll try to create a PR next week to clarify this point in the Kubeflow documentation (unless I am wrong or someone as a better way to proceed)

 I haven't check that recently (so I did not create a PR), but I plan to test a KF 0.6 brand new installation next week, so I can verify that. I'll update this issue with some feedback results

This appears to still be an issue.  There is nothing in the docs that tells me to set the redirect URI
