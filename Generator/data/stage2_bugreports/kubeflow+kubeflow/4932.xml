Following the instructions to setup a private cluster on Google Cloud GKE, I reached the point of kfctl apply were i get the following error:
failed to apply:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Apply failed for kustomize:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: Apply.Run  Error [unable to recognize "/tmp/kout242652420": no matches for kind "Certificate" in version "cer

		As a work around you could try removing seldon from your KFDef to skip installing seldon.
Do you have cert manager installed in your cluster?

		For our deployment of Kubeflow onto a private GKE cluster, we had to remove certmanager and seldon components.
Have seen other comments on setting up firewall rule due to private GKE setup - cert-manager now works fine and seldon installs too.

 How does the firewall issues relate to this particular issue?
I think this issue might have nothing to do with private GKE. I suspect this is the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/1121&gt;kubeflow/manifests#1121&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and is due to a race condition in which end up trying to create cert-manager resources before cert-manager is fully ready.

		I stand corrected looks like cert-manager might have specific issues related to private GKE.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/release-0.11/getting-started/webhook.html#running-on-private-gke-clusters&gt;https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/release-0.11/getting-started/webhook.html#running-on-private-gke-clusters&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Although I think firewall rules blocking the webhook will manifest as errors like the following
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error from server (InternalError): error when creating ".build/kubeflow-apps/cert-manager.io_v1alpha2_certificate_admission-webhook-cert.yaml": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "webhook.cert-manager.io": the server is currently unable to handle the request
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think the original error might have been different and might have been the race condition I indicated above.

		Looks like adding a firewall rule like the one below fixed this.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Per https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/release-0.11/getting-started/webhook.html#running-on-private-gke-clusters
# We need an extra firewall rule to allow certmanager webhooks.
apiVersion: compute.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
kind: ComputeFirewall
metadata:
  name: kfname-cm # {"type":"string","x-kustomize":{"setBy":"kpt","partialSetters":[{"name":"name","value":"kfname"}]}}
spec:
  description: "Allow traffic to cert manager webhook"
  allow:
  - protocol: tcp
    ports:    
    - "443"
    - "6443"
  sourceRanges:
  - 172.16.0.32/28
  direction: INGRESS
  networkRef:
    name: kfname # {"type":"string","x-kustomize":{"setter":{"name":"name","value":"kfname"}}}
  # Enable logging to help debugging
  enableLogging: false # {"type":"bool","x-kustomize":{"setter":{"name":"log-firewalls","value":"false"}}}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This will be part of the blueprint see: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/gcp-blueprints/issues/33&gt;kubeflow/gcp-blueprints#33&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 just a heads up that we also needed an extra firewall rule for port 8443 for Katib and KFserving controllers to function correctly on a private cluster. Can dig up some more details if helpful.
