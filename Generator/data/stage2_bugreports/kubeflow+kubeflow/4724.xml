		I noticed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/richardsliu&gt;@richardsliu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 stating in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3727&gt;#3727&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that the 1.0 RC version of the kfctl must be used for upgrade. Downloaded 1.0 RC4 and yes indeed it solved THIS issue - though it required that I provide an absolute path as relative path had same problem
So this worked though not as described in document
kfctl build -f /Users/edibice/kubeflows/kfctl_upgrade_gcp_iap_0.7.1.yaml  -V
It did not create the ${UPGRADE_DIR} mentioned below - it seems to have modified the existing kf-poc deployment instead
"The above command creates a new Kubeflow application in the same directory, with a name in the form of a 7-character long hash value. The directory structure should look like:
${PARENT_DIR}
|----${KF_DIR}
|----${UPGRADE_DIR}
|----kfctl_upgrade_spec.yaml
You can examine and change the kustomize parameter values in ${UPGRADE_DIR}."

Applied build above and it seems to have at least run to completion as the attached logs show. The Kubeflow UI interface however still shows "build version 0.7.0"

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yantriks-edi-bice&gt;@yantriks-edi-bice&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'm trying to do the upgrade and have the same issue with you. May I know how did you get the name of your kubeflow app where it's  in your case?

		It's looking for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/itcabb/kubeflow-kubeflow/blob/1007eac1b4453508b325d7f5a88705bd498a4add/bootstrap/pkg/kfupgrade/kfupgrade.go#L182&gt;app.yaml  &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Seems like this deprecated in the new kfctl.
Changing the old yaml deployment to app.yaml and running the upgrade will kick off the upgrade, depending on your version it might work. My upgrade ultimately failed. I am going to start clean.

 ya i figured by letting kfctl print out the two values... I think the documentation is ambiguous. Let me submit a PR for an update on documentation.
