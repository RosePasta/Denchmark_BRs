/kind bug

My private k8s cluster (version: 1.17.4)
I tried to install kubeflow and got error message as below
Encountered error applying istio-install: (kubeflow error): Code 500 with message: Apply run Error error when creating "/tmp/kout701552754": Internal error occured: failed calling webhook "validation.istio.io": "Post: https://istiod.istio-system.svc:443/validate?timeout=30s: service "istiod" not found filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:202"
Will retry in 8 seconds. filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:203"

What did you expect to happen:
kubeflow 1.0.2 should be installed successfully in my private k8s cluster.
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]
I found that kubeflow 1.0.2 uses istio version 1.1.6. And also I found istiod is new daemon service from istio version 1.5 or later.
I check if istiod service created in my k8s cluster. No istiod service is not created forever.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: 1.0.2
Kubernetes platform: (kubectl, 1.17)
Kubernetes version: 1.17.4:
OS (centos 7):

Etc
I don't know why kubeflow version 1.0.2 try to connect isdtiod service which is not created forever.
Is this bug or my mistake?
Does anyone know this issue and has solution?
Thanks in advance.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/insoo67park&gt;@insoo67park&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you give us a step-by-step flow of how you installed KF 1.0.2? There're various deployment options on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so it'd be good if you specify how you approached it, so we can help.

istiod is new daemon service from istio version 1.5

The istiod control plane was indeed introduced from Istio v1.5 encapsulating Pilot, Citadel, etc.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/8bitmp3&gt;@8bitmp3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In fact, I installed istio v1.5 into my private kubernetes cluster (v1.17.4) before trying install kubeflow v1.0.2  (istio with dex version).
My steps are below

I deleted istio-system namespace from my kubernetes cluster (kubectl delete namespace istio-system) - I thought this would delete all resources related istio v1.5
-&gt; I checked if all the services/pods/deploys are deleted from kubernetes cluster)
I downloaded kfctl from https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/
I executed command (tar -xvf kfctl_v1.0.2-0-ga476281_linux.tar.gz)
I executed command flow as said at https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-istio-dex/
-&gt; export PATH=$PATH:/home/download/kubeflow
-&gt; export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.0-branch/kfdef/kfctl_istio_dex.v1.0.2.yaml"
-&gt; export KF_NAME=kf-test
-&gt; export BASE_DIR=/home/download/kubeflow
-&gt; export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}
-&gt; mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}, cd ${KF_DIR}
-&gt; wget -O kfctl_istio_dex.yaml $CONFIG_URI
-&gt; export CONFIG_FILE=${KF_DIR}/kfctl_istio_dex.yaml
-&gt; kfctl build -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
-&gt; kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}
Something normal logs are passed on my console, and after that, a message trying to connect to  "https://istiod.istio-system.svc:443/validate"  and fail to find istiod service in k8s was appeared on my console repeatably.

In fact, I tried to install in GCP's VM  with microk8s environment. But in GCP's VM environment, I also met a error message related to istio's valiation (but not exact same with above message)
Only case I success to intall kubeflow is below case.

GCP VM enviromnent
2, microk8s
in kicrok8s, I execute a command (microk8s enable kubeflow)

I think, install for kubeflow is not esay with istio and it is specially informed to users how to install KF with istio.
Thanks a lot in advance.

		I found that the same error message is in "istio-security-post-install-release-1.3-latest-daily-xxx" pod. (kubectl logs istio-security-post-install-release-1.3-latest-daily-xxx -n istio-system)
I guess, something check process is done in istio-security-post-install pod and at there it refers to istiod service which is not exist.
I hopes this information would be helpful for your analysis.

		This is weird and should not happen. Maybe upstream Istio pushed an image that doesn't work with current 1.3 installations? I would open an issue in upstream Istio (if none exists already), provide the image that produced the error and ask about it.

		I have the same issue not only using version 1.0.2, I've tried 0.7 version and had same error... Is there a workaround for this?

		Thanks for your help.
I solved this problem with upgrading to kubeflow version v1.1.0 (and from my machine to vm on google cloud platform)
But I think, in my case root cause is my networking environment.
I guess some docker image or other things did not communicated as needed.
I close this issue.

		Same problem here trying to install kubeflow v1.1.0 in on-prem k8s.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kfctl apply -V -f kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.1.0.yaml
kfctl exited with error: failed to apply:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Apply failed for kustomize:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: Apply.Run : error when creating "/tmp/kout494903682": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "validation.istio.io": Post "https://istiod.istio-system.svc:443/validate?timeout=30s": service "istiod" not found
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The 'istiod' service is never created.
