	<summary>Cannot logout from kubeflow dashboard UI</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I used kubeflow with istio_dex for authentication. User can authenticate and log-in fine. However, I don't see anyway to logout. Clicking on the user profile icon on right side does nothing. The only work-around is to explicitly delete the cookie.
What did you expect to happen:
User can log out by clicking the user profile icon on the top right side.
Anything else you would like to add:
N/A
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): dev_local
