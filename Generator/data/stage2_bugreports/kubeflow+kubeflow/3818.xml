/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Customize your Amazon EKS cluster configuration before following the next step
${KUBEFLOW_SRC}/scripts/kfctl.sh apply platform
Error:
/Users/chuancc/mywork/mylabs/kubeflow/kubeflow-aws/scripts/aws/util.sh: line 26: /Users/chuancc/mywork/mylabs/kubeflow/kubeflow-aws/kfapp/aws_config/cluster_features.sh: No such file or directory
What did you expect to happen:
Initial kubeflow successfully.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Under deployment/aws/infra_configs/ cluster_features.sh wasn't there, and now it's cluster_features.yaml. Not finish yet?

		Or
remove "source ${KUBEFLOW_INFRA_DIR}/cluster_features.sh" from scripts/aws/util.sh ?

		Similarly, i am encountering the same issue when deploying to AWS EKS using 0.6.1 while using instruction at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Changing branch to 0.6.1

		cluster_features.sh was meaningless, eksctl used cluster_features.yaml  as configuration.

		cluster features options are not supported in 0.6 branches above. The major concern for us is this is EKS specific. We also want to decouple the cluster creation and kubeflow deployment.
Let us know if you have any requirements, we can prioritize it.
