	<summary>When copying files during GCP &amp; AWS error message provides incorrect details</summary>

/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Run kfctl init then delete cluster.jinja from the .cache directory to simulate a bad cache download or misconfigured repo.
You'll get an error message saying it cannot create a directory when you attempt run kfctl generate
What did you expect to happen:
I expected to get an error saying that the input path was not present.
Anything else you would like to add:
I ran into this when trying to test some unrelated changes which pointed to master which at the time was being extracted to the wrong place. With the correct message it would have been faster to debug. This is relatively minor
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): df2b68d
kfctl version: (use kfctl version):
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube)
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version):
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): 18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
