	<summary>Kubeflow on EKS not starting jupyter notebooks</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I'm playing around with a Kubeflow installation on EKS following the instructions in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Everything seems to work fine, but when I try to start a jupyter notebook server and i click "SPAWN" the request returns a 500.
Checking the logs in the jupyter-web-app pod I see the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[2019-05-22 15:31:20,934] ERROR in app: Exception on /api/namespaces/kubeflow/notebooks [POST]

kubernetes.client.rest.ApiException: (404)
Reason: Not Found
HTTP response headers: HTTPHeaderDict({'Audit-Id': 'db5efa14-8ccd-4921-a2ac-8c885afe154b', 'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8', 'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff', 'Date': 'Wed, 22 May 2019 15:31:20 GMT', 'Content-Length': '19'})
HTTP response body: 404 page not found
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So to me it seems it's trying to hit an endpoint in the Kubernetes api that doesn't exist (404).
I'm using the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/commit/ea43dfacf8216481ca2f1d9fcf90fc972392a6af&gt;current master kubeflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with Kubernetes v1.12 on EKS. I'm running a very simple setup in dedicated VPC, the only caveat is that i'm using dedicated IAM roles as I can't let eksctl create them on-demand unfortunately.
Can anyone help me debug the issue?
Thanks a lot for this project and thank you in advance for your help!
Alessandro

		Looks like it's better to use a stable version for EKS. I will make some changes and cherry-pick to v0.5-branch. Then I will update documentation to use v0.5-branch later. This will give more stable environment.

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Jeffwan&gt;@Jeffwan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , thanks for looking into this. The v0.5.1 binary seems broken as it doesn't support the . The v0.5.1 version source seems to have some conflict with Istio and Ambassador, making the ambassador pods continuously crash. I'll open separate issues for those.

 I mean use v0.5-branch kfctl.sh.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;export KUBEFLOW_SRC=/tmp/kubeflow-aws
unset KUBEFLOW_TAG # in case you set this env.
export KUBEFLOW_VERSION=v0.5-branch
mkdir -p ${KUBEFLOW_SRC} &amp;&amp; cd ${KUBEFLOW_SRC}
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/${KUBEFLOW_VERSION}/scripts/download.sh | bash
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And then edit ${KUBEFLOW_SRC}/scripts/aws/util.sh to add following changes before your apply k8s. I will make this PR cherry-picked back to 0.5.

I can reproduce this issue in master branch, Let me check what is changed on note book controller side.

 For aws, we have not integrated with admission-webhook. Could you check if that's why we see 404 for notebooks resources?  I check crds and I do see this here.

 if you are using  the updated image jupyter-web-app it has dependency to PodDefaults which is installed in admission-webhook componnet. Just check the log of jupyter-web-app  to see what the problem is.

 Can you change to elder version temporarily?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl -n kubeflow edit deployment jupyter-web-app

change image to `gcr.io/kubeflow-dev/jupyter-web-app:v0-43-g810b0b46`
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Lastest change for PodDefault and AdmissionController is not compatible with current AWS settings

NOT export KUBEFLOW_VERSION=v0.5-branch
export KUBEFLOW_VERSION=0.5-branch is right and
do curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/v0.5-branch/scripts/download.sh | bash.
because in &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/v0.5-branch/scripts/download.sh&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/v0.5-branch/scripts/download.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Thanks for pointing this out. I think I unset  and didn't figure out this issue. I will file a PR to make the change.  in the curl url also need to be parameterized. I will stick to KUBEFLOW_TAG.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;export KUBEFLOW_SRC=/tmp/kubeflow-aws
export KUBEFLOW_TAG=v0.5-branch
mkdir -p ${KUBEFLOW_SRC} &amp;&amp; cd ${KUBEFLOW_SRC}

		Seeing the same issue in a recent on-prem deployment of K8s + Kubeflow. KUBEFLOW_TAG set to v0.5-branch does not help the situation. Any other thoughts?
