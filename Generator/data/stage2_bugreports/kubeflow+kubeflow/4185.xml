	<summary>No registration flow on new cluster</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

Followed this guide &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to set up Kubeflow on a new on-prem k8s cluster.
No problems with init, generate, or apply.
Then I created a service for ingress-gateway(also tried with port-forwarding).
Can open the dashboard, but nothing loads, and two 405 in the network-tab.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[[ownedNamespace.namespace]]	405
get-all-namespaces	405
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When trying the URL individually, they both respond with:
{"error":"Unable to ascertain user identity from request, cannot access route."}
Manually creating a new profile had no effect.

Was expecting the registration flow to open, and give me the option to register a new user. As stated here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Anything else you would like to add:
First tried to create the cluster with --istio_enable=false, then did a kfctl delete all -V and tried with istio enabled.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (dashboard is broken)
kfctl version: v0.6.2-0-g47a0e4c7
Kubernetes platform: on-prem/vanilla
Kubernetes version:  1.15.2
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CoreOS nodes

		This is a bit embarrassing, looks like it was my outdated browser that caused this issue. Tried Firefox which is newer and it worked.
