/kind bug /kind question

Used XGBoost example to deploy in kubeflow.
Builder was successfully building the image and pushing.
Serving deployer was used to deploy an endpoint.
The pod was deployed with seldon.
The pod crashed with following error.(Attaching a screenshot)


What did you expect to happen:

Expected seldon to deploy and run with REST argument.

Anything else you would like to add:
I have a doubt if seldon 1.5.0 still supports REST argument. Also when i ran a pod with similar deployment spec but without REST argument the pod was running fine.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): v1beta1
kfctl version: (use kfctl version):kfctl v1.1.0-0-g9a3621
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube) AWS EKS
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.17
