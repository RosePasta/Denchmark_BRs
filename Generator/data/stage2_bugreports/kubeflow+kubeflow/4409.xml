	<summary>Can't customize build artifacts before applying</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
# Build some config
kfctl build -V -f ${CONFIG}

# Copy custom overlays into build artifacts
cp -R ../kustomize/* kustomize/

# Run appy
kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG}
After following the above steps, I would expect that my custom overlays would be picked up by kustomize and applied. Instead kfctl sees that the repoCache is out of date, deletes the cache, and the kustomize folder with my overrides, rebuilds based on the config (basically a new build), and applies it as if my changes never happened.
What did you expect to happen:
My changes/overlays would be built and applied.
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]
This log seems interesting
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Deleting cachedir .cache/manifests because Status.ReposCache is out of date  filename="kfconfig/types.go:464"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seems that it deletes the cache b/c there is no status property in the kfdef after upgrading to 0.7
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): 0.7-rc5
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): 0.7-rc5
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube) IBM IKS
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.15.5
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu
