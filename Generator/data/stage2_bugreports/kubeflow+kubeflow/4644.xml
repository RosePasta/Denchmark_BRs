/kind bug
I'm getting an error when running some pipeline-building code in a notebook running on a kubeflow cluster I set up last Oct. It's run OK in the past.
Update: It worked again once, and then it's failed 3 times in a row. It's still intermittent, but with a lower chance of success..
What steps did you take and what happened:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;image = kfp.containers.build_image_from_working_dir(
    base_image='tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-py3',
    image_name='eu.gcr.io/my-project/my-image:latest',
    file_filter_re=r'.*\.ipynb',
    timeout=3*60*60 # 3 hours
)

my_func_op = kfp.components.func_to_container_op(
    func=my_func,
    base_image=image
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output:

error pushing image: failed to push to destination eu.gcr.io/my-project/my-image:latest: DENIED: Access denied.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
Everything to succeed, as it always has with identical code in the past, and did around 30 minutes ago.
Anything else you would like to add:
With no code, config or environment changes, this has been working fine for a few months. This last week it started working only intermittently. Now, I can't get it to run at all.
As an aside, I'd like to upgrade to the latest version. I used some web UI to install, but the upgrade guide refers to kfctl. If I installed via UI, can I still grab kfctl to upgrade?
I would create a new deployment of KF from scratch, but after using the UI, I had to go in and edit a few different settings to work around auth problems, run some command-line bits to get autoscaling node types or settings correct - I didn't keep track of all of that. What would you recommend?
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): 812ca7f (kubeflow/pipelines@812ca7f)

Note.. when I open the menu, I get a "build menu". Are these instructions looking to refer to that? In which case, 0.6.2.

kfctl version: (use kfctl version): Not sure where to run this. Opened a terminal on the notebook server: /bin/sh: 1: kfctl: not found
Kubernetes platform: GCP
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): v1.12.10-gke.17
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): My laptop? Win10 64-bit. No code running here though.
