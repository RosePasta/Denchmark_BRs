	<summary>fresh baremetal install fails to start tf-job-operator - can't find CRD</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I'm trying to install Kubeflow 0.6rc0 and tf-job-operator is not taking off
k8s client  v1.15.0
k8s server v1.14.3  baremetal - kubespray+metallb
kfctl is compiled from fresh master branch
used unmodified kfctl_existing_arrikto.0.6.yaml
and pod with tf-job-operator is in CrashLoopBackOff, trying to find CRD and fails, but it looks like CRD is there...
can someone please point where to look to fix it?

		Something looks wrong with your TFJob install.
The version should be v1
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/eeaff416be9d273356bb55e2d823bb797b950ba4/tf-training/tf-job-operator/base/crd.yaml#L44&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/eeaff416be9d273356bb55e2d823bb797b950ba4/tf-training/tf-job-operator/base/crd.yaml#L44&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But it looks like you have v1beta1 installed.
It also looks like the CRD was installed via ksonnet which indicates an install from a version previous to 0.6.

I would suggest deleted the CRD and reinstalling it.

Are you trying to install 0.6 on a cluster you had previously installed Kubeflow on?

		Hi jlewi,
thanks for your reply


Are you trying to install 0.6 on a cluster you had previously installed Kubeflow on?


yes, was trying to install 0.5.1 there before and removed with
kfctl delete all -V
kfctl was of previous precompiled version then
probably left some residual
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

the following helped:
cd ${KFAPP}     # where kfcluster configs are
kubectl delete crd tfjobs.kubeflow.org
kubectl create -f kustomize/tf-job-operator/base/crd.yaml
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

please close this issue
