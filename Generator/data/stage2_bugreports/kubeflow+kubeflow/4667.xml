&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Originally, I've tried to install pip install tensorflow-data-validation==0.14.1. That lead to the same error.
I've tried following standard images (they are listed in the drop-down list in image selector):

gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-1.14.0-notebook-cpu:v0.7.0
gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-2.0.0a0-notebook-cpu:v0.7.0

Everything works as expected with this image:

gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-2.0.0a0-notebook-cpu:v0.5.0

Environment:

Kubeflow 0.7.1 for the GCP with Cloud IAP. On the home screen kubeflow shows version 0.7.0

		Same/similar issue for me as well.
kubeflow: 0.7.0
gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-2.0.0a0-notebook-gpu:v0.7.0
Starting a new python3 notebook, run pip install tensorflow.
Get the same error.

This will install the pip packages inside your /home/jovyan directory as opposed to the root python filesystem. This is typically what you want to do because /home/jovyan is backed up by persistent storage so if the pod restarts you won't have to reinstall your packages.

Using --user does allow the package to be installed. I'll have to test it again, but after I wrote this up, I believe I had problems with --user when I was trying to upgrade applications that were already installed. I could be mistaken on that though and it could have been completely unrelated.
For this specific case though, using --user does work.

I tried, but it didn't work. I haven't copied the error message. Currently uninstalled kubeflow from our GCP cluster. I will re-install it and make test again (during this week) to check exactly what is an output of --user option.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vaskokj&gt;@vaskokj&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you might be running into issue with your python path
We use this in our xgboost_synthetic notebook which we run under ci
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/blob/188ba8f091cd952ddf71551dba1ad46776e6d46c/xgboost_synthetic/notebook_setup.py#L21&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/blob/188ba8f091cd952ddf71551dba1ad46776e6d46c/xgboost_synthetic/notebook_setup.py#L21&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you look here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/blob/188ba8f091cd952ddf71551dba1ad46776e6d46c/xgboost_synthetic/notebook_setup.py#L42&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/blob/188ba8f091cd952ddf71551dba1ad46776e6d46c/xgboost_synthetic/notebook_setup.py#L42&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can see that you have to add the directory to your python path (I think restarting your kernel also works).
You want to add them higher in the path so they take precedence over any system packages.

I don't quite follow how my paths are screwed up. This seems to be an issue within the docker container itself.

@vladhc Can you provide more information about what doesn't work mean?

I've re-installed kubeflow 0.7.1 in GCP. This time --user option worked without any error messages.

		<comment id='10' author='vladhc' date='2020-04-24T02:22:51Z'>
		--user will install the packages into /home/jovyan. So if you already have the packages installed you need to update your python path to make sure that directory is higher in the pythonpath.
