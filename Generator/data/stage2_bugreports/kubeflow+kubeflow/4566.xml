	<summary>Jupyter notebook launch in kubeflow-created profile/namespace fails on Openshift 4.x</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
Tried launching a Jupyter notebook in a profile created by kubeflow
What did you expect to happen:
The notebook pod shout start
Anything else you would like to add:
It looks like kubeflow profiles add a label to the profile/namespace of "istio-injection: enabled", which eventually leads to an istio-init container trying to come up at launch-time.  That istio-init container fails because it's trying to do something with iptables, which is not in play for Openshift 4.x (I'm using 4.2).
If I remove that label from the namespace, the Jupyter pod does come up and is functional.
Environment:
Openshift 4.2

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: (use kfctl version):
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube)
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version):
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):

Kubeflow version:  v0.7.0
Client Version: 4.3.0-0.okd-2019-11-15-182656
Server Version: 4.2.8
Kubernetes Version: v1.14.6+dea7fb9

		I have not tried this with 1.0 yet, but I suspect it is likely to still be an issue.
