/kind bug
In kubeflow 0.7, Env TF_CONFIG is not set in the job's pod for non distributed tfjobs. However in kubeflow 0.6, it was set for both distributed and non distributed tfjobs.
I am not sure it is a kind of bug or it was done intentionally.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 0.7.0
kfctl version: v0.7.0
Kubernetes version: v1.15.3
OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
