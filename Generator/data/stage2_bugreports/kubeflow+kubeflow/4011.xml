 yes, for katib-db, the below ENV will create katib database automatically if it doesn't exist (&lt;denchmark-link:https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql&gt;https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Can you show me the pod logs of katib-db? how many times had the Pod restarted?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;          - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
            value: "katib"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		AFAIK, for some PV,  docker image cannot work well anyhow.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/boniek83&gt;@boniek83&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  so you can also try to change image of katib-db deployment to   and change  value of katib-db deployment as below to try what happens.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        args:
        - --datadir
        - /var/lib/mysql/anotheranyname
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Is your PVC bound to PV? Please provide more information

		I am using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nfs-client-provisioner&gt;https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nfs-client-provisioner&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as storage provisioner on on-premises kubernetes cluster. PVC is bound to PV.
mysql:8 restarted only once. It prints a lot of:

[Note] Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

after startup (every 2-3 seconds)
I can manually create database when inside of db container. Only after creating database manually, service shows active endpoint and I can telnet to katib-db at port 3306. I didn't test if connetion works with mysql client command due to errors earlier and recommendation to try mysql 5.
When using mysql:5 image database brings itself up (database is created automatically) but katib-manager is not working:

[mysql] 2019/08/30 10:24:17 packets.go:36: unexpected EOF

is printed to logs and katib-manager restarts. Telnet to katib-db at port 3306 from another container works, but mysql -h katib-db -P 3306 -u root -p doesn't, command exits with error:

ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading initial communication packet', system error: 0

Will there be an option to specify our own mysql instance and username? Running mysql on kubernetes with root is not a good practice - no replication, no monitoring, no backups, no security.
