	<summary>Looping "Could not find namespace kubeflow-anonymous, wait and retry" on initial apply</summary>

/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Ran  as per instructions in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Operation did not exit but looped with these messages:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARN[0474] Could not find namespace kubeflow-anonymous, wait and retry: namespaces "kubeflow-anonymous" not found  filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:353"

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
I expected the command to exit successfully having applied the config.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): I don't have this running yet - how is this different from version printed by kfctl?

 I believe that you saw this message during apply, not generate.
Can you confirm?
This is more of a UX issue than a bug.
The kfctl code is waiting for the default namespace to be created before exiting.
However the code should be of LogLevel info and not warn, since it is not an abnormal condition.
In addition, I feel that the wording should be different to convey that this is a normal part of the installation.
The current wording makes it seem like there is something wrong.
How about: Waiting for default Profile namespace (kubeflow-anonymous) to be created...

		Yes indeed - my apologies - that certainly was apply and not generated. I updated the issue to reflect this.
The problem is that this is in a retry loop and, I believe, times-out with an error. I killed the process in each case assuming this was an issue with configuration.

		Let me get you more info here. I see now that I need to let this run to completion - and if there's a timeout I'll investigate further. And yes - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yanniszark&gt;@yanniszark&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		The apply operation does indeed fail with a non-zero exit code (1) with this message:

		&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;So here's what going on&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;



kfctl tries to create a default profile in which to consume kubeflow


if kfctl can't identify the id of the user running kubeflow (currently true for all non GCP configs)
then kfctl just creates a profile "kubeflow-namespace"


The logs indicate the creation of the profile
INFO[0206] creating Profile/kubeflow-anonymous           filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:447"


Here's a link to the relevant code 


kubeflow/bootstrap/v2/pkg/kfapp/kustomize/kustomize.go


         Line 338
      in
      6af406b






 resourcesErr := kustomize.deployResources(kustomize.restConfig, body) 








After the profile is created; the code waits for the namespace to be created. That's what the logs indicate
WARN[0206] Could not find namespace kubeflow-anonymous, wait and retry: namespaces 
"kubeflow-anonymous" not found  filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:353"


Relevant code 


kubeflow/bootstrap/v2/pkg/kfapp/kustomize/kustomize.go


         Line 352
      in
      6af406b






 msg := fmt.Sprintf("Could not find namespace %v, wait and retry: %v", defaultProfileNamespace, nsErr) 








So it looks like there is a problem creating the namespace associated with the profile and we eventually give up


&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Further debugging&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ashahba&gt;@ashahba&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  To debug this we need to figure out what why profile creation is failing could you please include the following

Output of kubectl -n kubeflow get profile -o yaml kubeflow-anonymous
Output of kubectl -n kubeflow describe porfile kubeflow-anonymous
Logs of profile controller

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Workaround&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Creation of the default profile is the last step in Kubeflow setup so everything else should already be setup
You can probably just create a suitable profile either the CLI or the UI in order to use kubeflow

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Conjecture on what the problem is&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;



I think the problem is we set the user id to "kubeflow-anonymous"

https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/v0.6-branch/bootstrap/v2/pkg/kfapp/kustomize/kustomize.go#L326



I think the profile will then try to create some cluster RBAC bindings for this user


I suspect this is failing because there is no "kubeflow-anonymous" user as a result the profile controller throws an error before creating the namespace

		I can successfully set up the kubeflow on my centos VirtualBoxes now. Here's my instructions . Wish could do help for you.

For the issue here, I followed the workaround by @jlewi , and create the kubeflow-anonymous manually.
After namespace issuse, when we do the kfctl apply again, I hit the issue #3810 . For this issue, I followed the suggestion by @jlewi , using following script(Modified a bit from original as we are already have "apply -k" in kubectl on 1.15.3).

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash

for i in $(cat app.yaml | grep '^        path: ' | awk -F: '{print $2}');do
  childdir=${i#*/}
  if [[ -d kustomize/$childdir &amp;&amp; -f kustomize/$childdir/kustomization.yaml ]]; then
    #kustomize build kustomize/$childdir | kubectl apply -f -
    #Using following line instead , as we are already on 1.15.3 of kubectl.
    **kubectl apply -k "kustomize/$childdir"**
    sleep 3
  fi
done
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

NOTE: Kubeflow is a very long time setup process. There's a long list of docker images need tobe downloaded. Sometimes, they need the proxy, and some others would failed with proxy. So, this may need restart docker on your node with/without  the proxy to make them all done.

		Here's how I was able to resolve this one on my end.
If ever you have already applied do this:

I deleted all my Kubeflow clusters

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kfctl delete all --delete_storage
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Deleted the istio-system namespace from Kubernetes
--- so that the error on Port already being used won't happen

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kubectl delete namespaces istio-system
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Deleted the path I initialized

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ rm -rf &lt;kapp_path&gt; 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Created a namespace kubeflow-anonymous

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kubectl create namespace kubeflow-anonymous
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Reinitialized, re-generated and re-applied

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kfctl init ${KFAPP} --config=${CONFIG} -V
$ cd ${KFAPP}
$ kfctl generate all -V
$ kfctl apply all -V
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Verified if working

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kubectl get pods -n kubeflow
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If ever you're just going to start initializing, download the config files first and then add the kubeflow-anonymous namespace.
Hope this helps someone.

 if you'd like to submit a fix that would be great. It would be great to confirm though what the root cause is. I think to do that we'd like to see the logs of the profile controller to see if its failing because of the RBAC issue.
I think there's an open question about what the correct behavior should be in the case where we don't know the user's identity (i.e. this case).
One suggestion would be to grant all users access to the default profile.

		Is it better to provide an option to explicitly create default profile. If cluster admin like to have it, grant all user access to this profile is ok. Otherwise, kfctl should not create any profile and this is expected behavior. cluster admin can add users via other ways.

		Had the same error with microk8s 1.14.6. However, after ~10 loops over this warning it exited with 0. And namespace was successfully created.

		This should be fixed in 0.7.0
In 0.7.0 we only create the default profile for GCP because in that case we can get the email.



kubeflow/bootstrap/pkg/kfapp/coordinator/coordinator.go

 if kfapp.KfDef.Spec.Email == "" || kfapp.KfDef.Spec.Platform != kftypesv3.GCP { 





In 0.6 we  had attempted to generalize that behavior to the case where if an email was provided in the KFDef we would use it to create a default profile. That caused problems though in the anonymous case.
