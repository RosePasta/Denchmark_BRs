	<summary>Receiving ingress spec error when trying to follow tutorial</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

I was following the setup guide &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-ui/&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I decided to use the username and password option to connect to Kubeflow. When I hit create deployment, it got stuck on  and just kept printing that out for an hour. The  was stuck on "Creating" so I clicked on it and there was an error at the top of the page that said . Sure enough the spec for that service says . Not sure what is going on but something is busted.
What did you expect to happen:
Kubeflow to be initialized without any hassles and the ingress to be initialized.

I used the UI &lt;denchmark-link:https://deploy.kubeflow.cloud/#/deploy&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to create the deployment.
Environment:
Brave browser

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): not used
Kubernetes platform: GKE
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.1", GitCommit:"4485c6f18cee9a5d3c3b4e523bd27972b1b53892", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-07-18T09:18:22Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"} Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"11+", GitVersion:"v1.11.10-gke.6", GitCommit:"feb35bccc781d4b5d16125f53e396fe2643d6618", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-07-26T17:47:00Z", GoVersion:"go1.10.8b4", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
