Manage Contributor option is not there in the kubeflow UI

[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
After installing kubeflow kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.1.yaml  , I logged into kubeflow UI with default namespace (anonymous)as per the steps &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/deploy/install-kubeflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I do not see manage contributor option.
I created the kubernetes cluster and deployed kubeflow.
What did you expect to happen:
I expected that by default namespace, I get admin privilege to view "Manage Contributor"
Anything else you would like to add:

 Using kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.1.yaml  is really a single user install so Manage Contributor will not be applicable
