/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

Followed the GCP UI installation instructions (with OAuth)
Encountered #4043
Deleted the cluster
Decided to try the GCP UI installation instructions (with username/password instead)
Got:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2019-09-16 16:41:58.950: Getting enabled services for project REDACTED..
2019-09-16 16:41:59.859: Proceeding with project number: REDACTED
2019-09-16 16:42:06.128: All GCP services are available and configured successfully!
2019-09-16 16:42:06.502: Deploy acknowledged by backend
2019-09-16 16:42:17.641: Deployment initialized, configuring environment
2019-09-16 16:42:17.654: your kubeflow service url should be ready within 30 minutes (by 17:12:17): https://kubeflow.endpoints.REDACTED.cloud.goog
2019-09-16 16:42:17.655: Validating if kubeflow service endpoint is up...
2019-09-16 16:42:48.382: Waiting for the kubeflow service endpoint to get ready...(Expected time remaining: 30m)
... all the way down to 0, and stayed there
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note: there are NO clusters deployed at this point. I don't know what it's waiting for.
What did you expect to happen:
Kubeflow :)
Please, if someone can advise - did I not clean up the failed installation correctly?
How can I reset this so I can try again?
