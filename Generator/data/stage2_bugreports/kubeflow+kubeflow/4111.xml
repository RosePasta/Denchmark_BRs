	<summary>Cannot create new node groups in EKS</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
Node groups that are created after Kubeflow has been deployed don't get the same rights as the original node groups. Because of that pods that run on these nodes cannot do certain things, such as downloading data from S3.
What steps did you take and what happened:
I created an EKS cluster with two initial node groups [cpu, gpu-1] using eksctl and deployed KF on it. After KF has been deployed, I added a new node group [gpu-2] with the same definition as gpu-1.
After that, I ran the same task in Pipelines that downloads some data from S3 using both gpu-1 and gpu-2.
The data are downloaded using AWS CLI: aws s3 sync $1 .
I was able to download those data on gpu-1, but not on gpu-2.
What did you expect to happen:
I expected both jobs to succeed.
Anything else you would like to add:
Copying IAM inline policies from gpu-1 Role to gpu-2 in AWS Console fixes the issue. However, I think that kubeflow should be able to do this automatically.
eksctl cluster config:
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig
