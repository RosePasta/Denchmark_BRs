	<summary>0.5.1 not deployable due to recent master change</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
v0.5.1 uses master in aws utils.sh on the istio dependencies.
Thus it was removed throu:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/commit/f10f4fb954ad8617d0d6d35ba01356e4b19f3815&gt;f10f4fb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

There is also a patch here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/commit/d38b6e7c02cf487d86f001269a971bd13b48d08c&gt;d38b6e7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But this last patch, I think should either:

use the KUBEFLOW_TAG instead of KUBEFLOW_VERSION
or add the letter v in front of ${KUBEFLOW_VERSION}
Otherwise it wont find anything as the url is:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/v0.5.1/dependencies/istio/install/crds.yaml
(containing the v)

Is there any chance to have v0.5.1 tag patched correctly?

		The code on the release branch should not depend on master; so that seems like a bug that we should fix.

  I will ask my teammate to cherry-pick this change to 0.5-branch and then I will file a PR to update documentation to use stable branch.

Double check this issue. We need to use KUBEFLOW_TAG rather than KUBEFLOW_VERSION in the istio url.

		 is trying to reach the files in  but they no longer exist.
This applies both to the v0.5.1 (tries to download from master) and the master (tries to download from ${KUBEFLOW_TAG} which is again master).
There seems to be a problem with kiali (the required secret doesn't exist?) in v0.5.1 as well so even after hardcoding into util.sh, v0.5.1 is still not deployable.
I've only been able to deploy using commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/commit/877a1a71bf317951bd0527db15f68d73c2e55c73&gt;877a1a7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We cherry-pick change to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3444&gt;#3444&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Then, if we use v0.5-branch, we are good to go.  It will get istio based on branch.

I can also see that the master branch util.sh is still pointing to dependencies/ that doesn't exist.

Please manually create kiali secret in the cluster. 0.5-branch will use istio in 0.5-branch. This commit upgraded istio version and brings in new changes. It won't be cherry-picked back to cluster.

I can also see that the master branch util.sh is still pointing to dependencies/ that doesn't exist.

Yes. util.sh will be deprecated very soon. I am working on golang cli and that tool will not use istio under dependencies. Don't worry about the scripts now. Thanks! :D

To manually create 'kiali' secret:
kubectl apply -f   , the content below:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret

name: kiali
namespace: istio-system
labels:
app: kiali
chart: kiali
heritage: Tiller
release: istio
type: Opaque

username: YWRtaW4=   # admin
