		Hi.
I ran into the same issue today. I first tried to install Kubeflow with Istio 1.7.4, which resulted in the same error described by you.
After a downgrade to Istio 1.6.13 I was able to complete the installation. The CONFIG_URI used in the instructions mentioned by you points to &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.1-branch/kfdef/kfctl_azure.v1.1.0.yaml&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.1-branch/kfdef/kfctl_azure.v1.1.0.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which contains the following comment:
"It is expected to have Istio 1.6.x installed in istio-system namespace"
Maybe that also helps you to perform the installation? It seems that further adjustments are needed to make it compatible with Istio 1.7.x.
Best regards,

		I took the same steps as you did, and in addition to this problem, I encountered another problem.Have you ever encountered the following problemï¼ŸThanks.
 kfctl exited with error: failed to apply:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Apply failed for kustomize:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: Apply.Run : error when creating "/tmp/kout125728891": admission webhook "validation.istio.io" denied the request: configuration is invalid: TLS match must have at least one SNI host.

 that sounds like a separate issue with cert-manager instead. If you still have that problem, can you file a separate issue please? I recently saw another such issue.

  Thanks! I've solved this problem with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/5070&gt;#5070&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it's a problem caused by the upgrade of istio.
