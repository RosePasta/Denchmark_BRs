	<summary>kfctl: existing_arrikto: LoadBalancer address discovery doesn't work for AWS</summary>
	<description>
In platform existing_arrikto, we get the LoadBalancer address by looking at status.loadBalancer.ingresses[0].ip.
However, ELB gives a hostname, not an IP.
The logic should be fixed to also work for hostname.

 Can you provide an update please?
We will likely cut v0.6.2 this week. If you'd like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3760&gt;#3760&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to be included can you get that PR merged and then cherry-pick it onto the v0.6-branch?

 it seems &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Jeffwan&gt;@Jeffwan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has LGTM'd it but the CI bot hasn't picked it up.
However, the v2.zip file no longer exists in master, but will exist in v0.6.2.
In order to deal with this I understand that I need 2 PRs:

Merge this functionality in master, without the changes to v2.zip.
Cherry pick it in v0.6.2, adding the changes to v2.zip.

I will use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3760&gt;#3760&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to merge in master and open another PR to cherry pick the change in v0.6-branch.
Does this sound good ?

 Sounds good. How does release work? 0.6.2 will be cut based on 0.6-branch or a separate branch. If it's 0.6-branch, I think there's no need to cherry-pick to v0.6.2

 v0.6.2 will be cut based on the v0.6-branch.
PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3760&gt;#3760&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 adds the functionality to master. From there, it will be cherry picked to the v0.6-branch.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Jeffwan&gt;@Jeffwan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if you are ok with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3760&gt;#3760&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you please LGTM it?

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yanniszark&gt;@yanniszark&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it looks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3760&gt;#3760&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was merged.
Has it been cherry-picked to v0.6-branch?
If not can one of you open a cherry pick please?

 the commit that cherry picks this in v0.6-branch is this:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/commit/2c9dfe5edd68d026f6fa137a3533a2ab4d9021f1&gt;2c9dfe5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

While it was cherry picked before the PR was merged, in essence nothing changed, only the v2.zip file was removed.
