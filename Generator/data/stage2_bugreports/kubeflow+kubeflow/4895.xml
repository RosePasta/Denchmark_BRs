	<summary>Pipeline DAG is not coming up in Kubeflow dashboard</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I ran a kubeflow pipeline with ParallelFor operator which in turn created 1600 nodes in my pipeline. using kubectl i was able to track the status of all the 1600 nodes but from Kubeflow Dashboard nothing is coming up.
Its Says No graph to show
What did you expect to happen:
To Pipeline run graph to show up
Anything else you would like to add:
When i checked the API responses, for pipeline run with less nodes, has nodes field in the pipeline run time spec where as compressedNodes for pipeline run with 1600 nodes
what is the limit on number of nodes after which the run service starts compressing the node details in the API response
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 0.7.0
Kubernetes platform: EKS
Kubernetes version: version: 1.14
