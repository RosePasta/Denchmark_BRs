	<summary>kfctl apply overrides customized changes</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

kfctl build -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v0.7-branch/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.0.7.0.yaml
made some dummy changes in kustomize/
kfctl apply -f kfctl_gcp_iap.0.7.0.yaml

What did you expect to happen:
Customized changes shouldn't be overridden.
Anything else you would like to add:
This is probably because during kfctl apply kfctl didn't check whether it's already built.
Environment:

kfctl version: (use kfctl version): v0.7.0-rc.5-0-g18fba77a

 Do we need to make a similar change for AWS?
It looks like existing.go doesn't do anything for generate.

 This change seems brings another problem.
In our case,

kfctl build -f ${remote_file}, kustomize folder is created.
we ask user to change local copy of ${remote_file}. For example, specify role, region, cluster name
kfctl apply -f ${local_file}

We need kustomize to regenerate manifests after step 2. This PR actually block this.
Checking cloud config makes sense, I am wondering any case user need to update kustomize folder? It supposed be generated from manifest configuration.

		I can confirm that customization on manifest won't be applied due to this change.

 I think this is working as intended; i.e.  is not intended to regenerate the kustomize  files if they have already been generated. This is by design because this would end up overwriting any changes the users had made to the kustomize files. We want users to provide a signal that the intended behavior is to overwrite the kustomize files. Rather than add an "overwrite" or "force" option the expectation is that users would just remove the kustomize directory and then run build and/or apply to take into account changes to the KFDef file.
So in your case the situation would be as follows

kfctl build -f ${remote_file}, kustomize folder is created.
we ask user to change local copy of ${remote_file}. For example, specify role, region, cluster name
rm -rf kustomize
kfctl apply -f ${local_file}

Alternatively users could do

curl -L -O http://.../kfctl_aws.yaml
we ask user to change local copy of ${remote_file}. For example, specify role, region, cluster name
kfctl apply -f ${local_file}
