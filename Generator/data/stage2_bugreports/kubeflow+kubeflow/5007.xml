	<summary>Release versions discrepancy in the UI after upgrading from 0.6 to 1.0.2</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

Upgrade kubeflow from  to  using the following manifest:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.0-branch/kfdef/kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.2.yaml&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v1.0-branch/kfdef/kfctl_k8s_istio.v1.0.2.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
The UI should display the appropriate version of the kubeflow install. Instead it displayed dev_local

It seems the issue might originate from this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/centraldashboard/webpack.config.js#L22&gt;line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (This is where the bug seems to be. The version displayed is dev_local):
kfctl version: (use 1.0.2):
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. GKE)
Kubernetes version: (v1.18.2):
OS (MacOS):

		It looks like the code is using an environment variable to set the version.
It doesn't look like this environment variable is actually getting set in the manifest.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/master/common/centraldashboard&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/master/common/centraldashboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Which I think is why BUILD_VERSION is defaulting to dev_local
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avdaredevil&gt;@avdaredevil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is BUILD_VERSION used to set the commit in the UI.

		Right, when the website-image is  not when it's  this enironment variable needs to be set. And the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/master/components/centraldashboard/Makefile&gt;Makefile&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/master/components/centraldashboard/make-win.ps1&gt;make-win.ps1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 both send this as  to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/centraldashboard/Dockerfile#L6&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here is the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/centraldashboard/webpack.config.js#L22&gt;line in the webpack build file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where this env_var is used
