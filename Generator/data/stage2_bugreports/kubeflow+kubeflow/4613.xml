 thanks for reporting!
Personally, I don't think we should skip deleting the namespace.
This seems like a symptom of failing to cleanup something properly and we should investigate the root cause.

		I deployed abc and was facing many issues so had to delete and re-apply facing yet more issues which were insurmountable. So I gave up and created xyz which worked well. I did not yet delete abc in order to compare between the two and learn about some of the issues I faced with abc. Then I proceeded to delete abc which indeed deleted the kubeflow namespace. So many resources cannot be deleted if they're in use but for some reason this one goes through. So now xyz is broken as well. I agree namespace deletion should not be skipped but specifying namespace should be part of the set up.

 Got it. Maybe next time, I should change the namespace first. Thanks.
