	<summary>Manage Contributors is case sensitive</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
When working with Manage Contributors we noticed that you need to write exactly the same casing as the e-mail is retrieved from our LDAP-server. Meaning that when I try to add a user writing the e-mail with all lower case it fails. Writing the e-mail with capital letter works.
Not working: &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:kyrre.havik.eriksen@nav.no&gt;kyrre.havik.eriksen@nav.no&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Working: &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:Kyrre.Havik.Eriksen@nav.no&gt;Kyrre.Havik.Eriksen@nav.no&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Both should work.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: v0.6.2
kfctl version: v0.6.2-0-g47a0e4c7
Kubernetes platform: on-premise
Kubernetes version: v1.15.4
OS: CoreOS

 keep in mind that the contributor UI will create K8s RBAC RoleBindings,in which the subject is case-sensitive.
So if you authenticate as  but the RBAC RoleBindings mention , it won't work.
Because of this, I think the validation check we have in place is valid and should not be relaxed.

: Closing this issue.

In response to this:

@Kyrremann keep in mind that the contributor UI will create K8s RBAC RoleBindings,in which the subject is case-sensitive.
So if you authenticate as Kyrre.Havik.Eriksen@nav.no but the RBAC RoleBindings mention kyrre.havik.eriksen@nav.no, it won't work.
