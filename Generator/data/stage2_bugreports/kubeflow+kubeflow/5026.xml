	<summary>Centraldashboard issues with navigating to pages</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

Install Kubeflow following the instructions for installing KF on an existing cluster. The instructions is at: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The deployment looks fine with all the pods &amp; services running.
I did a port forwarding of the centraldashboard as:
 kubectl port-forward -n kubeflow service/centraldashboard 8080:80; open localhost:8080
I can navigate to the centraldashboard in my browser and I can see the dashboard. However when I selected any options on the page, I would get an error as:
Sorry, /pipeline/ is not a valid page
What did you expect to happen:
I expect that I would see the child pages fine.
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]

		Ok, I figured out that I was doing it wrong by doing . I should follow the instructions: &lt;denchmark-link:https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/ingress-control/&gt;https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/ingress-control/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. After I did that, I was getting bunch of errors about can't forward traffics.
I did: kubectl logs -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway-5b8dd9c7fb-sbdbz
