	<summary>Outbound tls traffic blocked from notebook</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

Open notebook
Run following in Jupyter notebook terminal

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl https://google.com
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which returns error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl: (35) error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

A request to &lt;denchmark-link:http://google.com&gt;http://google.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 returns successfully
What did you expect to happen:
The https request gets completed
Anything else you would like to add:
It is most likely related to istio proxy outbound egress traffic.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 0.7.1
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): 1.0-rc2
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube) AWS managed by kops
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.14.1
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 18.04

		I wasn't able to reproduce this in a cluster deployed using the 1.0 config.
Is this:

all pods
only pods with ISTIO side car
just jupyter pods

Do you have any firewall settings or ISTIO policies that might affect outbound traffic?

		It is only pods with ISTIO side car
There are no special firewall settings or ISTIO policies. It is a fresh vanilla install.
Btw, I tried to test it with 1.0 but I am getting error while creating notebook server:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;User None is not authorized to list .v1.persistentvolumeclaims for namespace: anonymous
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I can confirm the same issue is with arrikto 0.7.1 install.
I was hoping the issue might be related to anonymous user but it is there with authenticated users either.

 found this Stack Overflow thread, not sure if relevant in your case:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50840101/curl-35-error1408f10bssl-routinesssl3-get-recordwrong-version-number&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50840101/curl-35-error1408f10bssl-routinesssl3-get-recordwrong-version-number&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But in any case, having more info about the curl command would help.
Can you run curl with -i -v flags and paste the output?

Here is the verbose curl output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -i -v https://google.com

curl: (35) error:1408F10B:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:wrong version number
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The thread suggests to use proxy but this not my case.
This issue is a huge roadblock for me as I cannot download data, install packages or use git from kubeflow notebook.
It might be related to this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/16458&gt;istio/istio#16458&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/20703&gt;istio/istio#20703&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have ingress controller listening (obviously) on port 443. Turning that off did not help.

		I managed to solve this by following steps:
installed Istio 1.4.3
installed kfctl_istio_dex.yaml with istio-crds and istio-install removed and set clusterRbacConfig to OFF
Now all works and it also solves &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4733&gt;#4733&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Should upgrade to Istio 1.4.3 be taken into consideration for 1.0 release?

 I wasn't able to reproduce this issue with v1.0 kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml config. I'm using GKE - since I don't have access to AWS.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6263389/74429584-4397f000-4e81-11ea-80f2-80ddf6c1327c.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

/cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/swiftdiaries&gt;@swiftdiaries&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you please provide more information on your particular setup? Could you check if this is related to how network is configured for your setup?

The problem is istio. You won't be able to even install kubeflow 1.0 on non-GKE install of kubernetes because of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4733&gt;#4733&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Upgrading Istio to 1.4.3 solves both issues.
Try non-GKE (on-prem, AWS+kops,docker for desktop), you will reproduce this easilly.

 thanks for the information. It seems we are discussing two problems together at once here:

With these flags setup appropriately you should be able to complete your Istio 1.3.1 installation with SDS on.
Regarding this error about outbound traffic, which version of Istio are you using?

These flags are dangerous and my cluster would not come up again after setting them. Istio pulled back and in latest version it doesn't enforce those flags anymore.
Kubeflow 0.7.1 with whatever version it comes with

Kubeflow 1.0 + Istio 1.3.1 won't even install because of bizzare flags
Kubeflow 1.0 + Istio 1.4.3 works
