	<summary>kubeflow generate errors out when --platform=minikube using kfctl 0.5.1</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I tried installing kubeflow on minikube platform but generate errored out. The error is mentioned below:
Command: kfctl generate all -V
Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error: couldn't generate KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Generate failed for ksonnet:  (kubeflow.error): Code 400 with message: Failed to set param application components ["ambassador","argo","centraldashboard","jupyter-web-app","metacontroller","notebook-controller","pipeline","pytorch-operator","tensorboard","tf-job-operator"]: could not find component: extracting module and component names from application: "application" is not a component or a module
Usage:
  kfctl generate [all(=default)|k8s|platform] [flags]

Flags:
      --email string      email if '--platform gcp'
  -h, --help              help for generate
      --hostname string   hostname if '--platform gcp'
      --ipName string     ipName if '--platform gcp'
      --mount-local       mount-local if '--platform minikube'
  -V, --verbose           verbose output default is false
      --zone string       zone if '--platform gcp'

couldn't generate KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Generate failed for ksonnet:  (kubeflow.error): Code 400 with message: Failed to set param application components ["ambassador","argo","centraldashboard","jupyter-web-app","metacontroller","notebook-controller","pipeline","pytorch-operator","tensorboard","tf-job-operator"]: could not find component: extracting module and component names from application: "application" is not a component or a module
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Any idea what might be wrong?

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;‚ùØ kfctl version
v20181207-4e7f4ed-198-gaeea303e-dirty-03e65e
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Looks like that's the 0.5.1 version.
What init command did you run?
I can reproduce this
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kfctl init --platform=minikube /tmp/kftest-3573-minikube
kfctl generate all
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The following works
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/kfctl init --platform=gcp --skip-init-gcp-project /tmp/test-3473
cd /tmp/test-3473
kfctl general all -V
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So it appears to be specific to minikube. Which would also explain why its not caught by our tests.
As a work around I would suggest following these &lt;denchmark-link:https://v0-5.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started-k8s/&gt;instructions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

to install Kubeflow on your existing cluster (minikube)

		Oh okay. Well, I am able to install kubeflow on kind/ any other k8s cluster by following this guide. But, since the docs contain minikube specific content, I thought it's best to give it a try. I'll try to do this on a minikube cluster. Thanks.

 Just to confirm, I tried the docs for  install on minikube and it works. So, I guess something's not right with ?
