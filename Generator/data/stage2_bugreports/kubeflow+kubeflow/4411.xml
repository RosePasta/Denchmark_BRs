	<summary>kfctl generate istio VirtualService with --use_istio false</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
The bug is that the kustomize generated configs contains service yaml for istio VirtualService when --use_istio false is used
What did you expect to happen:
No istio related configs generated
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]
With --use_istio false, there won't be istio CRDs and it will fail the deployment as some of the VirtualService is not recognised. See the errors below.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;no matches for kind "VirtualService" in version "networking.istio.io/v1alpha3"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: (use kfctl version):
v0.6.2
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube)
(On-prem) GCP cluster
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version):
1.15
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):

		ISTIO is required for Kubeflow beginning with 0.6.
The --use_istio flag is legacy and misleading and is removed in 0.7
