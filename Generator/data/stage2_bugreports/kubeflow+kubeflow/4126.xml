	<summary>kubeflow stuck at setup screen.</summary>

/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

setup microk8s

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;microk8s.status
microk8s is running
addons:
knative: disabled
jaeger: disabled
fluentd: enabled
gpu: enabled
cilium: disabled
storage: enabled
registry: disabled
rbac: disabled
ingress: enabled
dns: enabled
metrics-server: enabled
linkerd: disabled
prometheus: enabled
istio: enabled
dashboard: enabled
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


install kubeflow 0.6.2

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Guide: https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This led me to the Setup screen where If I enter a name and it does nothing, the env-info  endpoint returns
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;{"user":"anonymous@kubeflow.org","platform":{"kubeflowVersion":"v0.6.2","provider":"other://","providerName":"other"},"namespaces":[],"isClusterAdmin":true}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
I expect that when I access the ingress-gateway on istio-system the central dashboard opens and everything works.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: v0.6.2-0-g47a0e4c7
Kubernetes platform:microk8s on ubuntu

		Issue Label Bot is not confident enough to auto-label this issue.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://mlbot.net/data/kubeflow/kubeflow&gt;dashboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more details.

 looks like there might be a problem with the self registration flow. Any suggestion on how to debug?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Rohithzr&gt;@Rohithzr&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you might be able to work around this by creating a profile manually via the CLI. There are docs for doings this here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://v0-6.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/#manual-profile-creation&gt;https://v0-6.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/#manual-profile-creation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		So the Dashboard seems to be running in non-isolated mode. Registration Flow opens up since namespaces is empty.
Here's where it's hairy for me:

The dashboard takes the input and runs a createBinding against profile service.
If this fails an error should surface on the UI (worst case, error is still there in dev-console under the /workgroup/create route)
Did you try reloading? (perhaps the profile creation took time, and dashboard fetched the new list of namespaces before that step completed)

I'd need more data to help further:

Do you see an error?
Does the route actually have an error (in dev console)?

		Thanks, it does work if you create an profile manually.

		i have create a profile manually, the profile is:
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1alpha1
kind: Profile
metadata:
name: kubedemo   # replace with the name of profile you want
spec:
owner:
kind: User
name: anonymous@kubeflow.org   # replace with the email of the user
but when i visit the web ui, there is still a startup page, can you tell me is there other step?
