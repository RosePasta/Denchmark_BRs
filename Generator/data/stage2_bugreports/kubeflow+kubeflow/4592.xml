	<summary>Kubeflow v0.7.0 kfctl show is not working; make show a beta/alpha command</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Ran following commands to generate and see kubeflow application
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kfctl build -V -f kfctl_k8s_istio.0.7.1.yaml
$ kfctl show
Error: couldn't load KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 400 with message: Error creating KfApp from config file: config file must be the URI of a KfDef spec
Usage:
  kfctl show [all(=default)|k8s|platform] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for show
  -V, --verbose   verbose output default is false

couldn't load KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 400 with message: Error creating KfApp from config file: config file must be the URI of a KfDef spec
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Command kfctl show is failing.
What did you expect to happen:
kfctl show should create yaml manifests of kubeflow application.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 0.7.0
kfctl version: 0.7.0
Kubernetes version: v1.15.3
OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

 was show ever implemented? Should we remove the command?

		It exists in coordinator which then tries to call any platform implementing Show - but none do.
So yes

		Bump to P0 because I think we need to figure out what we are doing for 1.0.
It seems like show may not be completely working/implemented.
Supporting show is not not critical for 1.0
So here are my suggestions


Guard show with some sort of "beta" or "alpha" flag so the syntax would be
kfctl beta show ...



So its clear the command is in beta and not fully supported.


How is this to support with our existing CLI tools?




Remove the show command for now.


I think it would be advantageous to introduce an alpha or beta sub command so we can introduce and experiment with new commands.

		I think we still need to cut an RC with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/201&gt;#201&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in it. Once we've cut the RC we can close this issue.
