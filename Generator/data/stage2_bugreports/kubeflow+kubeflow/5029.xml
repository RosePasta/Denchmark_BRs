	<summary>unable to contact profile controller kubeflow</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

I have installed kubeflow using &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/tutorials/kubeflow-in-ibm-cloud-public/&gt;https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/tutorials/kubeflow-in-ibm-cloud-public/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I am connected via ssh to a remote bare metal machine.  Using  i get that the type is nodetype and there is no external address. Using the cluster ip from the kubernetes dashboard and using port 31380 ( the above command returns this ports ) i get ot the kubeflow dashboard but unable to contact profile controller kubeflow is shown on the bottom right and there are no namespaces available.
Picture : &lt;denchmark-link:https://imgur.com/a/9iMtzV4&gt;https://imgur.com/a/9iMtzV4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

How do i solve this issue?
Also there is no load balancer for IBM cluster. I tried intalling metallb but it messed everything up and coulnt even get to the dashboard following the above method.
Thanks

 Have you check the logs of centraldashboard? I had similar issues that were caused by the namespace variable in central dashboard failed to resolve at kustomize time causing lacking privileges for centraldashboard which gave me profile/namespace issues. One note however was that I used the 1.0.2 istio yaml for on-prem deployment and not the ibm one.

		I will try to help by providing more information.

I am connected via ssh to a remote bare metal machine. Using kubectl get -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway i get that the type is nodetype and there is no external address

I assume you mean the type is NodePort. you need to follow the section of the above guide to update its type to LoadBalancer, then you will see its external IP via running kubectl get svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system.

i get ot the kubeflow dashboard but unable to contact profile controller kubeflow is shown on the bottom right and there are no namespaces available.

Prior to kubeflow v1.0.2, it will require a cluster admin manually creates a profile. You can use this guide to create a profile: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#manual-profile-creation&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#manual-profile-creation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If you use export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_ibm.yaml" around May 20, you were deploying kubeflow v1.0.2, so you probably get to access the kubeflow dashboard prior to the automatic profile creation, which will be the first thing you saw when visiting the Kubeflow dashboard. it looks like this:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://camo.githubusercontent.com/28a40fecc32825811f2ba152ef597f26e407ca82c51e830ea3af1817ed3f18ef/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6b756265666c6f772e6f72672f646f63732f696d616765732f6175746f2d70726f66696c65312e706e67&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can follow  guide to create a profile via web UI. See details from &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#automatic-creation-of-profiles&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#automatic-creation-of-profiles&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Also there is no load balancer for IBM cluster. I tried intalling metallb but it messed everything up and coulnt even get to the dashboard following the above method.

Actually there are several (NLB 1.0, VPC load balancer, ALB, etc) depends on the Kubernetes worker node provider you choose. You can use this guide to see details: &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-loadbalancer-qs&gt;Quick start for load balancers&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
BTW: I'm to work on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/website/pull/2028&gt;kubeflow/website#2028&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to document the multi-tenant feature that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/adrian555&gt;@adrian555&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 added. it will be more helpful.
