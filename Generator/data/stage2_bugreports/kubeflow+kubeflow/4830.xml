	<summary>Parsing error when attempting to upload pipeline using kfp SDK</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
When attempting to submit a pipeline compiled with the kfp SDK (0.2.0) to a kubeflow v1.0 deployment using the kfp python client -&gt; upload_pipeline method I get a parsing error as follows:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
The submission to succeed and server response object containing pipleine id and other information to be returned.

Doing some digging, I encountered this bug with the same symptoms utilizing the CLI vs using the python client.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/2764&gt;kubeflow/pipelines#2764&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and associated PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/2876/files&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/2876/files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The fix was merged on the 29th of Jan but the 0.2.0 release was cut on the 20th. So it only made it into the 0.2.1 release.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): v1.0
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): kfctl v1.0-0-g94c35cf
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube) minikube
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.15.2
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS

It looks like the kfp has dependency for kfp-server-api &lt;=0.1.40 and 0.1.40 is the version that having this issue.

		I have continued to debug this error with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NikeNano&gt;@NikeNano&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  and it seams that there is one timestamp that is a unix-timestamp and therefore it crashes. Believe the error originates from the swagger files, by changing in the api_clien.py file that is generate from the swagger fil. You can get it to work, but the true fix is in the swagger file. My knowledge here is very limited however.

		does anyone have a workaround for this, i cannot really use the UI since the pipeline is uploaded as part of CI/Cd process?

I pinned to an older version of kfp-server-api when compiling.
kfp-server-api==0.1.18.3

		I am also getting this error with kfp-server-api=0.3.0

		I have been able to get it to work with a stand alone deployment with 0.3.0

		I am deploying via kubeflow with aws .... i tried changing the manifest to have v 0.3.0 but it didn't seem to fix it for some reason.
Its seems like they are aware of it here:
