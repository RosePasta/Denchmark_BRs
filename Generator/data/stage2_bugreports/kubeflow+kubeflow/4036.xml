	<summary>Manage Contributors cannot distinguish user name with numerical characters</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I tried to manage contributors to a namespace with Manage Contributors in central bashboard.
Our user names are distinguish individuals from numerical characters.
Such as

a001@example.com
a002@example.com
...

Manage Contributors creates rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io and servicerolebindings.rbac.istio.io for a001@example.com which name user-a-example-com-clusterrole-edit.
Since numerical characters are omitted from the resource names,
I could not add a002@example.com to contributors.
What did you expect to happen:
I expected that the resource name for a001@example.com is user-a001-example-com-clusterrole-edit.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): v0.6.2
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): v0.6.2
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube): kubeadm
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): v1.15.1
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu18.04
