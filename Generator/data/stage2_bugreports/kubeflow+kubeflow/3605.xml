	<summary>Outdated usage report message in kfctl with kustomize</summary>
	<description>
Saw following error message when running
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kfctl generate all -V --zone ${ZONE}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Building kfctl from head(&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/31a9bb666a13e3aea60f9a246574db27f2ee9d05&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/tree/31a9bb666a13e3aea60f9a246574db27f2ee9d05&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) which uses kustomize.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Notice anonymous usage reporting enabled using spartakus
To disable it
If you have already deployed it run the following commands:
cd $(pwd)
ks delete default -c spartakus
kubectl -n ${K8S_NAMESPACE} delete deploy -l app=spartakus
Then run the following command to remove it from your ksonnet app:
ks component rm spartakus

However, kubeflow/kubeflow is still source of truth for kfctl; so we need to get that PR cherry-picked onto kubeflow/kubeflow so the changes don't get overwritten on the next sync of kubeflow/kubeflow to kubeflow/kfctl

 Thank you so much.
Just one more thing. After &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3941&gt;#3941&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is merged can you follow these &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/hack/cherry-picks.md&gt;instructions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to cherry-pick it onto the v0.6-branch.
Its just a simple script you have to run to auto-create a PR with the same changes.
