	<summary>The pod "application-controller-stateful-set-0" cannot connect to apiserver after installation</summary>

/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
I followed the documentation on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&gt;kubeflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to install kubeflow.
After installation, I use the command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl get all -n kubeflow
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

to list all resources under the kubeflow namespace, which looks like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/application-controller-stateful-set-0   1/1     Running   13         35m

NAME                                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/application-controller-service   ClusterIP   10.111.235.141   &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP   83m

NAME                                                   READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/application-controller-stateful-set   1/1     83m
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, after a while, the state of pod application-controller-stateful-set-0 turns into Error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;NAME                                        READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
pod/application-controller-stateful-set-0   0/1     Error    13         35m

NAME                                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/application-controller-service   ClusterIP   10.111.235.141   &lt;none&gt;        443/TCP   83m

NAME                                                   READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/application-controller-stateful-set   0/1     83m
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I use the command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl logs application-controller-stateful-set-0 -n kubeflow
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

to see what went wrong within the pod, and it looks like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;{"level":"info","ts":1596987690.1994128,"logger":"entrypoint","caller":"manager/main.go:37","msg":"setting up client for manager"}
{"level":"info","ts":1596987690.199655,"logger":"entrypoint","caller":"manager/main.go:50","msg":"setting up manager"}

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

According to the log, the pod cannot connect to the apiserver. However, I can connect to apiserver even in host machine:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;telnet 10.96.0.1 443
Trying 10.96.0.1...
Connected to 10.96.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

By the way, the following error message appears in the installation:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARN[0578] Encountered error applying application cert-manager:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: Apply.Run  Error
 error when creating "/tmp/kout583686984": Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "webhook.cert-manager.io": the 
server is currently unable to handle the request  filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:202"    
WARN[0578] Will retry in 21 seconds.                     filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:203"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thank you in advance if you could tell what might go wrong here.

		It looks like there is a problem with your cluster because your pods are unable to connect to your Kubernetes master. Are other pods able to connect to your master?

 Your cluster doesn't have externalIP.
Firstly :You are using a doc that is installing Istio and Istio needs external IP(or a lot of infra setup)
If you don't wanna have externalIP you need to install only Kubeflow Pipeline SDK on your cluster, and some other components that u like but not all the components.
Based on which cloud provider you use there are docs on installing KFP on existing clusters.
Secondly: The error comes from network issue it seems. Please investigate that. The cluster itself has failed with network issues which again seems to come from the restricted network... you might need to add things such as NAT.
