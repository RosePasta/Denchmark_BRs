	<summary>Ambassador Version 0.34.0 causing DNS Issues on Worker Node</summary>
	<description>
We recently updated to ambassador 0.34. When I deployed kubeflow on a single node cluster (n1-standard-8) kube-dns seems to be running at 100% CPU. Other processes are not able to resolve DNS on the host. Deleting the ambassador deployment fixes the DNS issue.

		To reproduce, create a single node gke cluster with n1-standard-8 worker node and 1.9.6-gke.1 k8s version and deploy kubeflow-core (with ambassador 0.34.0)

		Can you see what exactly kube-dns is being asked to do? (I have a suspicion that Iâ€™d like to confirm.)
