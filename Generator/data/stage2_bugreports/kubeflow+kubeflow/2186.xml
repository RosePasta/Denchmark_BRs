	<summary>kfctl.sh fails if a user isn't explicitly added to the IAM policy</summary>
	<description>
gcloud email returns a case insensitive value for the email; but the IAM policy is case sensitive. This is issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/1936&gt;#1936&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
To fix this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/1937&gt;#1937&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 checks the IAM policy for the email and if its found uses that one.
However, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/1937&gt;#1937&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will exit with an error if the email address isn't found in the IAM policy. This will happen if the user has access through a google group.
We should not exit with an error if the email address isn't found.
