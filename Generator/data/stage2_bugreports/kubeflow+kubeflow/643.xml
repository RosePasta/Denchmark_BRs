	<summary>tf-cnn: no matches for kind "TFJob" in version...</summary>
	<description>
I saw the issue regarding the lowercase "f" in "TfJob," however, I'm seeing the same error after capitalizing to "F" in "TFJob." :
error: unable to recognize "tf_job_cpu.yaml": no matches for kind "TFJob" in version "tensorflow.org/v1alpha1"
What I did: pulled the latest from the github, modified the yaml file to have a capital "F" and then ran
kubectl create -f tf_job_cpu.yaml
I believe the issue is forcing to point to the right namespace, however, I don't know how to do that.

		That file is outdated. The correct version is apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1alpha1
You should generate the job spec using ksonnet as described &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/user_guide.md#run-the-tfcnn-example&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
