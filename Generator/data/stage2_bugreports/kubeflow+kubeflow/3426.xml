	<summary>kustomize should fail if it can't find a component in app.yaml</summary>
	<description>
kustomize package-manager will do a best-effort in generating and deploying components. It should error out if the component can't be found

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kkasravi&gt;@kkasravi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for opening this issue!
Giving a little more context on how this came up:
What happened:

I used kfctl + kustomize to install Kubeflow. My KfDef included component istio.
I deployed Kubeflow but I saw that Istio was not installed.
Istio was not installed because it is in package gcp, a package I had not included in KfDef.

What I expected to happen:

Istio should be installed since I specified it in components.
If Istio (or any component) can't be installed (because it can't be found), kfctl should fail and not succeed.
