	<summary>Deploy CLI `kfctl apply` fails due to `Network "default" requires specifying a subnetwork`.</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

We have a requirement in our organization to use Shared VPC (an attached network that does not exist within the current GCP service project)
I am following the instructions on https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/
I went through the instructions and made it all the way to the kfctl apply all -V step.
The apply fails with the error message (below), inferring that the default project network is being referenced (which in my case is deleted).
I've tried grep -r "networks/default" ." in the directory to find all references of the default network` and have replaced them to a Shared VPC network self link (with the full path and the partial paths)

https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/${PROJECT}/global/networks/${NETWORK}
projects/${PROJECT}/global/networks/${NETWORK}


I replaced the default network value in the 3 files that showed up:

gcp_config/storage.jinja
.cache/kubeflow/kubeflow-0dbd2550372c003ba69069aeee283bd59fb1341f/testing/test_deploy.py

What did you expect to happen:

I was hoping that it would reference the Shared VPC network (not the default network) and deploy Kubeflow.

Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]

I'm thinking there could be a requirement on permissions into the Shared VPC network, which I will also do a bit more exploration around.
Are there other Deployment Manager scripts that we are aware of that need to be updated accordingly?
The error messages suggests specifying a subnet, but unfortunately, I'm not seeing any documentation around this at this time.
