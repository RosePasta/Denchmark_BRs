	<summary>Kubefow+ LetsEncrypt+ Istio Dex 1.0.2 yaml</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
I am unable to receive a working certificate thru letsencrypt prod/staging API:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27989098/88207986-2f48f200-cc6e-11ea-87ca-e84c5d42cef6.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The current setup includes below approach
K8s cluster setup with 1.0.2 Istio Dex Yaml, mentioned in kubeflow.org documentation, which comes with istio 1.3.1 and cert-manager by default.
As my major task is to complete this with kubeflow enabled with istio-ingressgateway along with HTTPS Lets-Encrypt ACME SSL Certificate generation.
Kindly let me know a possible solution.
Environment:

Kubeflow version:
K8s API version 1.14
kfctl version: 1.0.2
Kubernetes platform: GKE
Kubernetes version:  (kubectl version --short
Client Version: v1.17.0
Server Version: v1.14.10-gke.36)
OS: default

Istio -1.3.1
Cert-Manager: the same which comes with default manifest.

		Do you have any errors indicating this is an issue with Kubeflow and not your cluster setup?

		Regardless of the setup that I am doing, it's the combination that I am using as default which comes with 1.0.2 YAML.

,
Kindly let me know if we are missing anything from our end because we are trying to have full-fledged setup with ACME cert's using default configuration or else if we need to use anything else
