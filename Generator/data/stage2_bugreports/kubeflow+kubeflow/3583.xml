	<summary>Should spartakus usageId be set in kustomize.go and not gcp.go?</summary>
	<description>
We are currently setting the spartakus usage id here



kubeflow/bootstrap/pkg/kfapp/gcp/gcp.go


         Line 1583
      in
      865f10e






 for _, comp := range gcp.Spec.Components { 





But this code is only invoked for GCP.
We probably need to move this into kustomize.go so we do it always; not just for gcp
