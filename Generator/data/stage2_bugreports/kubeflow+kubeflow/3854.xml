	<summary>[spawning jupyter failed] 'kubeflow-core' is not a component or a module</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to spawn the jupyterhub, but it fails. When I try this line of code:

ks param set kubeflow-core jupyterNotebookPVCMount /home/jovyan/work

it gives me the following error:

could not find component: extracting module and component names from kubeflow-core: 'kubeflow-core' is not a component or a module

Environment:

Kubeflow version: v0.4.1
kfctl version: v0.5.1
Kubernetes platform: Kubeflow on Kubernetes
Kubernetes version: v1.14.2
OS: Centos7
