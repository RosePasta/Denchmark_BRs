/kind bug
When trying to change namespace on Kubeflow main page, the drop down of namespaces is showing behind the left blue pane, which completely obstructs the list

Kubeflow version: 0.6
kfctl version: kfctl v0.6.0-0-g71aea0a9
Kubernetes platform: OpenShift
Kubernetes version: kubernetes v1.13.4+c62ce01

Just tried installing with the same setup as above but using version 0.6.2-rc.2.   Same issue with namespace selection

		I encountered similar issue. However, I could not judge if the drop down of namespaces is showing behind the left blue pane. For me, the namespace selection is just not working. When I click "Select namespace", there is a only a button animation (blue color appeared on white button) but no drop-down selection at all.
my kfctl version:  v0.6.1-rc.2-1-g3a37cbc6
kubernetes platform: Vanilla kubernetes installed from kubeadm
Kubernetes version: kubernetes v.1.15.1

		Yes, it's the same and has been resolved with the latest release.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shawnho1018&gt;@shawnho1018&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seems to have a different issue, and that seems to be based on no namespace list being returned to the dashboard (might be a networking / permissioning issue)

@shawnho1018 seems to have a different issue, and that seems to be based on no namespace list being returned to the dashboard (might be a networking / permissioning issue)

I also suspected it was the serviceaccount issue but I don't see any error log in
kubectl logs -n kubeflow -f centraldashboard-79df4778f7-glhfj
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubeflow-centraldashboard@0.0.2 start /app
 npm run serve

kubeflow-centraldashboard@0.0.2 serve /app
node dist/server.js

"other" is not a supported platform for Metrics
Using Profiles service at http://10.101.82.170:8081/kfam
Server listening on port http://localhost:8082
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As for networking, all master/worker nodes are routable to each other and I use Calico as my CNI. I logged onto centraldashboard pod and try to access kubernetes api-server to retrieve namespaces using the token in /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token. The result is positive.

Still puzzled on the issue. Any recommendation on which pod might worth to further investigate?

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avdaredevil&gt;@avdaredevil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  Thanks for looking into this issue.  In contrast to what I previously posted, I am actually hitting the exact same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shawnho1018&gt;@shawnho1018&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  (I originally has just assumed the namespace drop-down was hidden somewhere, but in fact it's not even selectable.)
Having said this, I do not believe the issue is caused by a "roll-your-own-kubernetes" networking setup that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shawnho1018&gt;@shawnho1018&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has with his kubeadm installation (because I'm hitting this on a plain-vanilla GKE cluster), nor do I believe that it was fixed in the latest release -- I am hitting this same issue even after doing a bleeding edge install of the kfctl manfests (i.e., by setting  at the  step).
The steps to reproduce my exact issue on GKE are listed below

Using minikube on a Mac. Is there a workaround to create a notebook server + namespace?
@deepdad  where do you see the error log? Could you point to me?
My symptom looks the same like yours. I am waiting for @avdaredevil  and @jlewi but it would be nice to diagnose if my error is the same as yours.

		That's in the browser &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shawnho1018&gt;@shawnho1018&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 developer tools
It may also be that I don't share the /Users folder with Virtualbox. That has too much access rights.
For the rest here's a history, it has some tiny differences with the docs (no ambassador, forwarding is different and this combines tow pages of the docs but I didn't change any of the files while it is sometimes the case that the  is hard coded in K8 files):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd kubeflow/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hey all, could you try checking the following:

In the Networks tab in chrome debugger, can you send the responses / statuses recieved for /api/has-workgroup and /api/env-info
In your console run:
JSON.stringify(document.querySelector("main-page").shadowRoot.querySelector("namespace-selector").namespaces)

For the first checking:
I could see returned value from /api/env-info but not /api/has-workgroup. The results are shown below for your reference.



Foe the console running the script you provided: Empty response.

		Okay this helps, so the dashboard server is unable to see any namespaces for your user. If you hover your mouse over your version (as shown below):

		Awesome! Thanks for the quick replies &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shawnho1018&gt;@shawnho1018&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
For context, the /api/workgroup/exists route allows the dashboard to quickly realize if you have IAP / OAuth headers, and if so do you have a workgroup (synonymous with a namespace for now) deployed.
Essentially from this, the dashboard concludes that the IsolationMode (for namespaces) is based on:

Single-User: Every user is a cluster-admin, and everyone sees the same list of namespaces
Multi-User: Each user is scoped to the namespaces they have access to (as owner or contributor), and if you don't own a namespace, initiate the registration-view.

		In that case, since I am the single user, shouldn't I simply see the all namespaces in the cluster? Still scratch my head without knowning how I could resolve this issue. Need a bit more guidance from you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avdaredevil&gt;@avdaredevil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Okay, so it seems you have no WorkgroupBindings in your network. Essentially the kfam-controller is giving the dashboard a list of 0 bindings. This is unusual to me as some system namespaces should have been created thus some bindings would exist for those. This part gets a little past my understanding of the backend.
I'd suggest pinging &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lluunn&gt;@lluunn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kunmingg&gt;@kunmingg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on Slack regarding a deeper understanding as to why kfam has no bindings.
Hope that helps?

		I also confirm this bug.
My understanding is that this is a blocker for v0.6.2.
The Dashboard lists user bindings for the namespace and gets nothing back, which makes the Central Dashboard not work without the GCP IAP Headers.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avdaredevil&gt;@avdaredevil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you describe in more detail exactly how the Namespace Selector is populated?
What are you expecting to find?
What is a WorkgroupBinding and why was it introduced?

Yes, it says platform Openshift.

We can create a default public profile for this case to save user effort.

From what I know, the default profile creation currently only happens for GCP.
I believe it's important to understand what &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avdaredevil&gt;@avdaredevil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was expecting to find but didn't.
In addition, making a Profile doesn't fix it for me.

 Why isn't the WorkGroupBindings populated? is it because of

No profiles were created?
Something else?

		Interesting. The Pod definitely picked up the environment variables and should be able to establish communication with the profiles API server. That doesn't seem to be the problem here, but it is a general issue we need to address.

 Your problem arises on a different step I believe. Your network may not have any bindings at all. The recommended way to create this workgroup/profile is to do this via kfctl for now (in non-identity networks, such as yours).
Easier, but may not work approach: We could fool the dashboard into thinking you are in multi-user and trigger a registration flow by running (in your Dev Console on Central-Dashboard):
document.querySelector("main-page")._setRegistrationFlow(true)

 Can you open an issue about the environment variables. If we're dependent on the order of deployment that seems like a bug. The central dashboard should be community with the KFAM backend via the DNS name established by the virutal service and service defined for the backend. Those should be deterministic based on the kustomize packages.

Can we reproduce this issue; IIUC we should be able to reproduce it by installing on an existing GKE cluster.
Are these changes related to the addition of the kfam API?
It looks like people are hitting this issue now with 0.6.1 which should not be picking up the KFAM API changes.
My guess is that the configs somewhere are not sufficiently pinned so people using releases prior to 0.6.2 are picking up some cherry picks.
if so; do we need to roll back some changes until we've tested further?

		<comment id='30' author='blublinsky' date='2019-08-13T23:44:47Z'>
		Here's my summary of the issue so far


The original issue on the thread is the namespace UI selection being half hidden which is #3698

This should potentially be fixed by the latest central dashboard image



A secondary issue that people are reporting is that they are not seeing any namespaces


This appears to be due to the fact that they are picking up the latest central dashboard image
which is now talking to the KFam API to identify which namespaces to display


It seems like there are two issues here
i) central dashboard may not be configured with the proper IP address of the KFam API
ii) They may not be creating any profiles so not have any namespaces which they can access




Users of v0.6.1 are picking up the central dashboard changes because our configs are not pinned to specific commits by


kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml on v0.6 branch  is pulling in master of kubeflow/manifests



kubeflow/bootstrap/config/kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml


         Line 298

      55d9d6d






 uri: https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/master.tar.gz 







kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml is pulling the latest of kubeflow/manifests/v0.6-branch



kubeflow/bootstrap/config/kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml


         Line 148
      in
      55d9d6d






 root: manifests-0.6-branch 







It looks like the v0.6 branch and also master were recently updated to pull in the new central dashboard image (see kubeflow/manifests#265)




Suggested Mitigation


The new central dasbhoard UI functionality needs more testing and probably documentation before  we give it to users


Users not using an RC should not be picking up the new dashboard


We should pin kubeflowmanifests on v0.6-branch to kubeflow/manifests commit before the update to central dashboard image


What do folks think?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yanniszark&gt;@yanniszark&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I think you were working on a PR to pin the kubeflow/manifests used on the v0.6-branch?

 I think you deleted/or hid you comment

I don't really follow the pinning. Repeating the commands that previously worked no longer do. The output looks different. Ending with couldn't create KfApp: (kubeflow.error): Code 400 with message: invalid name due to a DNS-1123 label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'm .

What did you give as the name for your KFAapp? I think the problem is your name isn't valid so you probably just need to fix the name.

 You should use v0.6.1; v0.6.1 should be pinned to the v0.6.1 release of the central dashboar.
If you are using v0.6.1 and not running on GCP you will need to create a profile via kubectl to create a namespace.
