 - Did you get this issue from the state in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3599&gt;#3599&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? I expected there were still some issues there but I thought I had seen this one before and addressed it. In any case, can you point me to the 0.6.0 compatible bootstrap endpoint you have so I can test against it?

		Ahh looking at this again I was basing some assumptions on what the old 0.5.0 config file looked like from app-config.yaml on master which had already been updated from what's on the v0.5.0 branch. I'm making the appropriate changes now and they'll be in the PR.

		OK, I'm still a bit confused here. I started basing the work to provide valid paths for both v0.5.0 and v0.6.0 deployments from master, where the last change to the click-to-deploy code came from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3045&gt;#3045&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
However, if I try to use that code and make a request against the existing deploy.kubeflow.cloud endpoint I see json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field AppConfig.packages of type v1alpha1.KsPackage in the 500 response. That makes sense given that the old deployment service wouldn't understand the new format.
However, in order to support both v0.5.0 and v0.6.0 deployments from the same UI deployment, do I need to also make sure the code that was in place for C2D in the v0.5.0 branch is incorporated as well, or can the new deployment service handle both simple by indicated the KfVersion in the request payload?

 Is this fixed? It looks like deploy.kubeflow.cloud supports deploying v0.6 so I'm guessing this has been fixed.
