	<summary>Culled pods remain in UI</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
Enable culling in notebook-controller-deployment
Pods are culled but remain in UI.
What did you expect to happen:
Pods to be culled and removed from UI, or remain in UI but with a message indicating that they need to be restored.
Anything else you would like to add:
kubectl logs notebook-controller-deployment-668d6b4cb7-tw244 -n kubeflow|grep culling 2020-01-20T20:18:24.842Z        INFO    controllers.Notebook    Notebook anonymous/fastnew needs culling. Setting annotations                                {"notebook": "anonymous/fastnew"}
kubectl get po fastnew -n anonymous Error from server (NotFound): pods "fastnew" not found
Yet it remains visible in the UI, leaving end users the impression that they can connect to their notebook. If they attempt to connect to it, they get an unhelpful "no healthy endpoints"
