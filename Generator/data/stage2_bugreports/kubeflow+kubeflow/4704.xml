	<summary>Included docker image doesn't contain tensorflow</summary>

/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Went to Notebook Server link, created new notebook with the included gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-1.14.0-notebook-gpu:v0.7.0 image. Started a Python3 notebook and ran
"import tensorflow as tf" and pythons typical no module found error.
What did you expect to happen:
tensorflow to be included in a tensorflow image.
Anything else you would like to add:
Launching a Python2 notebook in the same container, and tensorflow was available.
Which then leads to this issue when you try to

I have not tried the other images but will do that and follow up.
Environment:

kfctl version: (use kfctl version): 1.0.rc1
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube): Kubespray

		Lets verify that the new 1.0 image has TF and if it does close this issue.

		I did a sanity check on the new image
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl run -it --image=gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-1.15.2-notebook-gpu:1.0.0 tf-gpu-1-15 --restart=Never /bin/bash

&gt;&gt;&gt; import tensorflow as tf
&gt;&gt;&gt; tf.__file__
'/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/__init__.py'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I also see CUDA in the image
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/usr/local/cuda-10.0/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I tried gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-1.15.2-notebook-gpu:1.0.0 in a python3 notebook on KF 1.0 and it also worked.

		I verified that the new 2.1.1 GPU image has TF as well.
