		The name space is not selected by default  It may makes sense to set the default name space to user account. Also the documentation in kubeflow.org does not reflect the 0.6 UI this may be confusing for users to figure out.

 I'm seeing this error appear on all namespaces. Did you have to create the kubeflow-user namespace? what deployment name did you use?
: never mind, I found&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/&gt; this page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and created a new user, and that worked. We should definitely add this to the troubleshooting guide or improve the error message or something
