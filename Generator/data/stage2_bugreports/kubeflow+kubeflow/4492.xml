	<summary>Local crd versions not matching with kubeflow.org crd</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
Tried installing kubeflow 0.7.0 using the following
&lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v0.7-branch/kfdef/kfctl_aws.0.7.0.yaml&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v0.7-branch/kfdef/kfctl_aws.0.7.0.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Correctly updated the AWS_CLUSTER_NAME, region and roles in the config file.
When running the "kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_FILE}" command, it gets stuck with the following message
CustomResourceDefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "trials.kubeflow.org" is invalid: spec.version: Invalid value: "v1alpha3": must match the first version in spec.versions]  filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:183" WARN[0045] Will retry in 3 seconds.                      filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:184"
It keeps retrying multiple times without success and eventually the deployment fails.
I looked up the crd using "kubectl get crd trials.kubeflow.org -o yaml" and noticed that the version (v1alpha2) is not matching the version of the trial-crd.yaml (v1alpha3) under kustomize/katib-crds/base on my local system.
I edited the local crd version to v1alpha2 to match the trials.kubeflow.org version and tried deploying again.
This time it failed for pytorchjobs.kubeflow.org with the exact same message as above. It also fails in similar manner for experiments.kubeflow.org and profiles.kubeflow.org.
I am not sure if changing the local crd versions is the right way to fix this.
What did you expect to happen:
Successful deployment of kubeflow 0.7.0

		Any help would be highly appreciated as this is blocking our Kubeflow POC.
Thank you.

		The issue was arising because I had tried deploying kubeflow0.6.2 on the same cluster before and even after deleting it, there were some stale crd files present.
I deleted the crd files that were raising these issues - kubectl delete crd trials.kubeflow.org and tried deploying again.
It works!
