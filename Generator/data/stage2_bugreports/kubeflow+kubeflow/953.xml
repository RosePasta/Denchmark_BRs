	<summary>[gcp] backend services can't be listed insufficient IAM permissions</summary>
	<description>
In the scripts for setting IAM, I'm noticing that after creating a new deployment I'm getting the error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Waiting for backend id PROJECT=cloud-ml-dev NAMESPACE=kubeflow SERVICE=envoy...
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.backend-services.list) Some requests did not succeed:
 - Required 'compute.backendServices.list' permission for 'projects/cloud-ml-dev'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I believe in my case the service account already existed prior to the deployment being created because when I deleted the previous instance of the deployment the service accounts weren't deleted. The IAM permissions look correct.
I find that if I delete the service account and then update the deployment so its recreated it works.
My suspicion is that the problem is the service accounts aren't deleted when the previous deployment was deleted.
I suspect the service accounts might not get deleted because the roles aren't deleted &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/910&gt;#910&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I suspect that might block service account creation.
Although I believe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ankushagarwal&gt;@ankushagarwal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned that he observed the service account but not role bindings being deleted.

		I'm hitting this again.
I created a delete script to try to prevent this by cleaning up service accounts and roles when deleting the deployment
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi/kubeflow-dev/blob/master/kubeflow-deployments/delete_deployment.sh&gt;https://github.com/jlewi/kubeflow-dev/blob/master/kubeflow-deployments/delete_deployment.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I also tried fixing it by doing this after the cluster had been created but just recreating the service account and roles
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi/kubeflow-dev/blob/master/kubeflow-deployments/fix_admin_sa.sh&gt;https://github.com/jlewi/kubeflow-dev/blob/master/kubeflow-deployments/fix_admin_sa.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But when I tried it didn't fix the error.

 hit this issue again with deploy app
In the iap container:

ERROR: (gcloud.compute.backend-services.list) Some requests did not succeed:

		Seems caused by IAM binding leftover bug.
Web app fixed the problem before: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/1595&gt;#1595&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We can implement same logic in script or wait till it switch to go binary cli.

		How did the webapp fix this?

		If we delete the policy bindings for the service account and then add them back doesn't that fix things?

Clear policy binding for that sa account and add them back should fix IAM bug.
However, another issue that could cause it: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/1807&gt;#1807&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		So the AI's here are
Short term:

Document this error in the troubleshooting guide
https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/guides/gke/troubleshooting-gke/
Provide instructions for clearing the policy bindings; and then adding them back.

Longer term we could try to ensure that kfctl and web app check for policy bindings and clear them before deploying Kubeflow.

 Deploy with webapp on v0.3.2 should fix it.

		Users should be able to manually delete the role bindings by running the same command kfctl.sh delete does
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Delete IAM bindings
python "${DIR}/iam_patch.py" --action=remove \
  --project=${PROJECT} \
  --iam_bindings_file="iam_bindings.yaml"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Should we run that command always on kfctl.sh init to purge any existing bindings?

		<comment id='12' author='jlewi' date='2019-02-23T16:22:37Z'>
		I updated the script:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi/kubeflow-dev/blob/master/hack/fix_gcp_sa_permissions.py&gt;https://github.com/jlewi/kubeflow-dev/blob/master/hack/fix_gcp_sa_permissions.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It deletes the role bindings and then adds them back. I tried it out on one of the test deployments which was experiencing this problem and it worked.
