		Hi cyrilthank:
I see the same error log after deploying kubeflow 0.6.2.  However, I follow the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/#persistent-volume-claims-are-in-pending-state&gt;document&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to add all the required pv, and fix this issue.   For your reference

		Thanks for your reply

kubectl -n kubeflow get pvc

requesting since my poc is stalled with many errors
Thank you

		Hi cyrilthank:
I try my best to show my example cases to this.  In the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/#persistent-volume-claims-are-in-pending-state&gt;document&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there are two ways to solve  status in PVC and I choose the first one: 

Follow the PV format like &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/hyperparameter-tuning/hyperparameter/#persistent-volumes&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and create a pv-katib-mysql.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: katib-mysql
  labels:
    type: local
    app: katib
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /data/katib
Run the command kubectl apply -f pv-katib-mysql.yaml to create PV for katib-mysql.  Check PVC status with kubectl -n kubeflow get pvc again and you will see katib-mysql STATUS become Bound.
Repeat the steps for metadata-mysql(10Gi), minio-pv-claim(20Gi), mysql-pv-claim(20Gi) with different hostPath.   When all PVC Pending issues solved, everything is Good on Pipeline dashboard.
