	<summary>profiles-deployment log error - "Error from server (BadRequest): a container name must be specified"</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

I followed the install instructions for existing kubernetes cluster - https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/
I waited until all pods are running
I access the kubeflow dashboard, and there are no profiles (I have created one)
I can't create a jupyter server (no dashboard).

When I look at the logfile for profiles-deployment, I see this error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error from server (BadRequest): a container name must be specified for pod profiles-deployment-9885b4dbd-4r2wn, choose one of: [manager kfam]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
I expected the profile/namespace to show up
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 0.6.1 .. but the dashboard says 'build version v0.6.0-rc.0'
kfctl version: kfctl v0.6.1-rc.2-1-g3a37cbc6
Kubernetes platform: microk8s
Kubernetes version: 1.15.2
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): ubuntu 18.04

		The error you pasted is a bug in your kubectl logs command; you need to specify the container you are getting the logs for.
Can you try running
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl get profiles
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What does no jupyter dashboard mean? Can you  run kubectl -n kubeflow get deploy and verify the jupyter web app is running

 - I'll run through the steps again on 0.6.2 that was just released.  returned a profile I created after install. What I meant to say about can't create jupyter server ... is there is no namespace.  Without a namespace, the required namespace fields can't be filled in.

		Closing this issue .. the new 0.6.2 release seems to resolve the issue. I can see namespaces and I can create a jupyter server.
