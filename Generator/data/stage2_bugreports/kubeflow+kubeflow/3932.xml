	<summary>Frequent websocket disconnections; GCP, IAP, v0.6.2 RC</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
My setup is as follows

GCP
IAP
v0.6.2-rc0

I'm running Jupyter and I'm noticing semi frequent web socket disconnection errors; more so than in previous releases.
This is most pronounced when using a terminal because it just hangs and you have to refresh.
One thing to check would be the connection time outs for the GSLB as well as ISTIO?

		We should check what the GCP backend service timeout is set to.
