	<summary>Cannot access notebook servers: Sorry, /jupyter/ is not a valid page</summary>

/kind bug

I installed Kubeflow (v1.0 on Kubernetes 1.14) on AWS EKS and all components worked fine. Since the installation did not come with KFServing / KNative,  I installed KNative following these instructions: &lt;denchmark-link:https://triggermesh.com/2019/04/installing-knative-on-amazon-web-services-eks/&gt;https://triggermesh.com/2019/04/installing-knative-on-amazon-web-services-eks/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After performing above steps, I cannot access my notebook servers and pipelines through the Kubeflow UI anymore. The notebooks servers are still running though (tested with kubectl -n anonymous get notebooks). "Home", "Artifact Store" are all still accessible through the web UI.
What did you expect to happen:
Notebook servers and pipelines should be accessible through Kubeflow UI.
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 1.0 (dev_local)
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): v1.0.1-0-gf3edb9b
Kubernetes platform: AWS EKS
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): v1.17.4
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): (local machine) macOS High Sierra, v10.13.6

		How do you access the Kubeflow UI, are you using port-forwarding?
