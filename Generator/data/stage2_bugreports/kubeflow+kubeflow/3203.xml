	<summary>Leaking ingress resources after KF cluster deletion</summary>
	<description>
The KF deletion may not GC ingress resources due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce/issues/136#issuecomment-417480155&gt;kubernetes/ingress-gce#136 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
A short term solution is to extend the grace period (in both ksonnet and kusomize).
In the long run, we need to wait until there are no more ingresses in the namespace or the namespace is actually deleted and then exit, when deleting KF cluster.
