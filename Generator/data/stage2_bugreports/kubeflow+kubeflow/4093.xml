	<summary>installs from releases such as 0.6 of kfctl are broken</summary>
	<description>
Thrift have moved from git.apache.org to github - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22664#issuecomment-527142529&gt;hashicorp/terraform#22664 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is fixed in master - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4051&gt;#4051&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But tagged versions also reference the old thrift git

 broken in what way?
I thought that git.apache.org was a source needed during the build of kfctl.
Is it used elsewhere inside a Kubeflow installation?

		Oh true what I was trying to do was build kfctl. But there's no need to do that for old releases as it can be obtained at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases/&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thanks
