	<summary>Using non standard `df` on macOS causing error</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I am using coreutils package in order to be close to Unix ecosystem, which provides almost native df tool in order to replace macOS's df version. This situation causing an issue with determining correct available disk space.
&gt; cd scripts/setup-minikube.sh
&gt; chmod +x setup-minikube.sh
&gt; ./setup-minikube.sh
Assign CPUs between 3..22 [12]: 
Assign memory (in GB) between 8..91 [48]: 
df: invalid option -- 'g'
Try 'df --help' for more information.
./setup-minikube.sh: line 161: ((: &lt; 40: syntax error: operand expected (error token is "&lt; 40")
Assign disk space (in GB) between 40..0 [50]: 
What did you expect to happen:
Assign CPUs between 3..22 [12]: 
Assign memory (in GB) between 8..91 [48]: 
Assign disk space (in GB) between 40..701 [50]: 50
Choose a virtualizer/hypervisor installed on your system (virtualbox, vmwarefusion, kvm2, hyperkit):
Environment:

coreutils installed with brew package manager.

		Reopening this issue; because its not about kfctl.sh but setup-minikube.sh which might be worth updating and keeping.
