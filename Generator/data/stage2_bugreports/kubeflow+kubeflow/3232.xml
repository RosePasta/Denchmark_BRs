	<summary>Jupyter notebook pod scheduling fails with 'serviceaccount "default-editor" not found'</summary>
	<description>
I'm experiencing problems during creating of Jupyter notebook pod on my on-premise k8s deployment. StatefulSet fails with the nest error message:
Warning  FailedCreate  4m46s (x26 over 10m)  statefulset-controller  create Pod test-0 in StatefulSet test failed error: pods "test-0" is forbidden: error looking up service account kubeflow-workspace/default-editor: serviceaccount "default-editor" not found

I've checked the code there: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/869077d015d2e7cdb0d6af9af3d0a718aa786c3c/components/profile-controller/pkg/controller/profile/profile_controller.go&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/869077d015d2e7cdb0d6af9af3d0a718aa786c3c/components/profile-controller/pkg/controller/profile/profile_controller.go&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and I also couldn't find default-viewer service account.
What might be the problem?

		Update: my bad, I've used kfctl init $KFAPP without --version=v0.5.0, everything works now. Issue may be closed.

		I was able to work around this (I am using kfctl v0.6.1-rc.2-1-g3a37cbc6) by creating the service account:
kubectl -n kubeflow create serviceaccount default-editor
(I had created the jupyter server in the kubeflow namespace)

		I'm seeing this in 0.6.2 and command offered by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/doschkinow&gt;@doschkinow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does work-around the problem.
I think this issue should be reopened.
