	<summary>Dashboard's contributors section doesn't show all the namespaces I own</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

I set up a Kubeflow 0.7 cluster and get a gongyuan namespace.
I created a profile demo which also marks me as the owner.
However, in dashboard contributors section, it only shows me as owner for demo namespace, not gongyuan namespace.


What did you expect to happen:
I should be able to manage all the namespaces' contributors I own in UI.
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]
Environment:

Kubeflow version: build version 0.7.0
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): I no longer have the kfctl I used to deploy this cluster, but I think it's not related to the issue.
Kubernetes platform: GKE

		Actually, I'm not sure if Kubeflow intended to support one user being owner of multiple namespaces. Is that the case?

		In addition to UI support, documentation about how to grant contributor through SDK/CLI would also mitigate the issue.

		By default user can only be owner of one namespace:

Normal users don't have permission to create profile, only admin can assign multiple namespaces.
Kubeflow UI only show register page when the user doesn't own any namespace. So user only register once and get one namespace.

		Estimated efforts is 1~1.5 weeks, we need the relevant updates to the 2 other components, namespace selector (trivial if any), registration flow (also perhaps trivial), and tests
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Some notes for how to develop&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


First time only:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;npm i
make build-local
npm run build
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Run the commands in two separate terminals: npm run dev and kubectl port-forward svc/profiles-kfam 8081:8081

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To override user identity when developing locally&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

So I use an extension called &lt;denchmark-link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?src=bewisse&gt;MOD-Header&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that's very useful, and you can set your headers like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email: accounts.google.com:kubeflow-user@k
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This will kick in multi-user isolation mode on the dashboard. You can verify your isolation mode in the payload from /api/workgroup/exists (hasAuth field).

		Update, I don't think I will have cycles to fix this either. Note that central dashboard UI is written in Polymer with web components. Someone with related expertise should be able to fix it a lot faster (I don't know much about them).

 from the discussion on the other bug that we just closed as duplicate, you suggested this:
"&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abdulsalama&gt;@abdulsalama&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you can work around this by not using the Contributors UI to manage users."
What would be the alternative? I'm not aware of any other mechanism where I can add contributors to my profile other than the Contributors UI?

		We have documentation for adding users programmatically now: &lt;denchmark-link:https://master.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#managing-contributors-manually&gt;https://master.kubeflow.org/docs/components/multi-tenancy/getting-started/#managing-contributors-manually&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think that's enough for this use case.

		Hmm, but this feature will still be a nice to have.
