	<summary>Kubeflow install on AWS existing cluster stuck at setup screen</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

I have followed the steps for installing k8s_istio.0.7.0 here &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/overview/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/overview/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on an existing cluster. The steps I have followed work perfectly fine in GCP, kubeflow is running and I have been able to run my own pipelines but in AWS I am running into an issue where the startup page cannot be bypassed regardless of having the profiles created manually or through the UI itself
What did you expect to happen:
Expected to be able to create a namespace on the startup screen
Anything else you would like to add:
Mentioning again that everything worked correctly for deploying on an existing GCP cluster while on AWS all the services are deployed and working but the startup page will not let me login after the namespace and profiles have been created.
Here is some inspect data from the startup webpage is:
{hasAuth: false, user: "anonymous", hasWorkgroup: false}
hasAuth: false
hasWorkgroup: false
user: "anonymous"
{user: "&lt;denchmark-link:mailto:anonymous@kubeflow.org&gt;anonymous@kubeflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
",…}
isClusterAdmin: true
namespaces: []
platform: {kubeflowVersion: "unknown", provider: "other://", providerName: "other"}
user: "&lt;denchmark-link:mailto:anonymous@kubeflow.org&gt;anonymous@kubeflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
"
Not sure why namespaces is []empty while the namespace and profile for anonymous is created. I would also like to add that on the startup page it notifies that the namespace is created even though it never allows for logging in:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5704659/72295160-95e4b780-361c-11ea-9ef4-bc83eb9d2c5a.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Environment:
AWS

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: kfctl v0.7.0
Kubernetes platform: AWS EKS
Kubernetes version: 1.14

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/acesir&gt;@acesir&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
!
The  config doesn't provide authentication and it seems that there is something wrong with the way the CentralDashboard handles that.
cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/krishnadurai&gt;@krishnadurai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avdaredevil&gt;@avdaredevil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the meantime, I would suggest trying out the existing_arrikto config for v0.7, which includes authentication and shouldn't present this issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-existing-arrikto/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-existing-arrikto/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I understand there is no authentication setup with this install but that should not prevent it from being unusable or functional. As it stands now I should at least be able to get to kubeflow UI and select namespaces/profiles created. As I mentioned above, the same process works on GCP consistently but no so on AWS.
Thanks

Agreed, this is likely a bug.
I am suggesting an approach to get started in the meantime, so you don't have to wait for the issue to be resolved in order to use Kubeflow :)

  Understood I will try that for now and can update this issue if it indeed does resolve in AWS with &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-existing-arrikto/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-existing-arrikto/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 just to update. I used &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-existing-arrikto/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-existing-arrikto/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and after logging with default credentials &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:admin@kubeflow.org&gt;admin@kubeflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 i am getting the same startup page to create a namespace. Same issue as above, namespace and profile get created but I cannot get past the setup screen.
This seems to be an issue with Profiles in AWS EKS possibly? Not sure if you have any ideas to get past this.

 could you please paste the output of
kubectl get profiles
and
Could you also post the HAR file from the browser (navigate to tools -&gt; network tab) which you are using?

 asked for, can you also provide the logs of the Central Dashboard deployment?

I tried creating various different profiles so you might see various different namespace names. But it seems a lot of forbidden errors appear in the admin namespace that was created as part of the profile.

		Update:
I moved away from creating an EKS cluster and deployed using KOPS. The issue does not exist with a non managed kubernetes cluster and seems to be isolated to EKS only. I can login just fine and the profile/namespace is created. The only issue i see is the admission-webhook pod seems to not be coming up and is showing an error : MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "webhook-cert" : secret "webhook-certs" not found
I am deploying kubeflow 0.7 so not sure if this is resolved in 0.7.1
Update:
kubeflow 0.7.1 does resolve the admission-webhook issue
At this point this bug can be isolated to EKS, if there are some recommendations on what I can try based on the logs above let me know and I can try testing again with EKS cluster
