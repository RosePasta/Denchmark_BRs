	<summary>kfctl application_types_test and v1alpha_suite_test don't pass</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/2874&gt;#2874&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we started running kfctl unittests on pre/post submit. That uncovered the fact that the following tests aren't passing
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/application_types_test.go&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/application_types_test.go&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/v2/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/application_types_test.go&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/v2/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/application_types_test.go&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/v1alpha1_suite_test.go&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/v1alpha1_suite_test.go&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/v2/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/v1alpha1_suite_test.go&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/v2/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1alpha1/v1alpha1_suite_test.go&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think these might be auto-generated as part of kubebuilder.
I believe there are two copies of the file ("v2") because of an issue with ksonnet and kustomize depending on different versions of K8s client libraries. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kkasravi&gt;@kkasravi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 came up with some magic to work around this.
I think one issue is pulling in appropriate dependencies.
I think a second issue though is that the t at least v1alpha1_suite_test might be trying to start etcd in a sub process.
