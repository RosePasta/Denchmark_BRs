 Does this issue mean that we need our kustomize packages to generate a unique suffix for the instance label that gets attached to each resource owned by the application?

 Do we need this as part of our upgrade story for 0.7?
My initial guess is that yes; because I think we want to use the instance to link Applications to owned resources.
So if we have a 0.6 and 0.7 instances of the application the app.kubernetes.io/instance label should be different for the two instances and this is what will link the owned resources to the application.

		Yes, we need to get this in. We could do a suffix generator which would work in kustomize v2.0.3

		Bump to P0 because this is required for upgrades and thus 0.7 blocking.

 If we merge &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4052&gt;#4052&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'll sync with kfctl.
I haven't tallied what PR's remain that are bootstrap/kfctl related.
