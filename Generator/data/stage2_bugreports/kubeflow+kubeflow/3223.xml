	<summary>Error in AWS generate platform output</summary>
	<description>
When running the  command from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;Install with AWS docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this error is thrown
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;loading config file "/Users/tkye/dev/callysto/src/callysto/aws_config/cluster_config.yaml": no kind "ClusterConfig" is registered for version "eksctl.io/v1alpha4" in scheme "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/scheme/register.go:60"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Changing the cluster_config.yml to point to apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5 fixes it

Thanks for reporting this issue! New version of eksctl is not compatible with older API versions. We are talking with eksctl team to either add support or we generate cluster spec based on user's eksctl version. In progress of it.

 File a PR to address this issue for short term. eksctl will guarantee backward compatibility in next release
