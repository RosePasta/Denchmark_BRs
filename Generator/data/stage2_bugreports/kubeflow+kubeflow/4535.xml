The pipeline's Artifacts ui doesn't show artifacts
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/201339/69743936-2cc1e700-1137-11ea-9f25-fcf18866e3e5.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
I deploy kubeflow to AWS EKS and my default artifact repo is on S3. After some pipelines produce artifacts I was expecting to see them in the Artifacts page of the Pipelines UI. My repo definition is
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: workflow-controller-configmap
data:
  config: |
    artifactRepository:
      s3:
        bucket: {{ .Values.bucketName }}
        keyPrefix: {{ .Values.artifactsRoot }}
        endpoint: s3.amazonaws.com

Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): 0.7.0
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube): AWS EKS
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version):

		Issue Label Bot is not confident enough to auto-label this issue.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://mlbot.net/data/kubeflow/kubeflow&gt;dashboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		i can confirm the problem. and it's more like on the ui side because i can see that workflow-controller did upload the artifacts to the s3 location.

		to make pipeline artifacts actually show up, we need to use &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/misc/metadata/&gt;metadata&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this has nothing to do with the artifacts  listed in pipeline.  run the demo will make what happens under the hood more clear, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/metadata/blob/master/sdk/python/sample/demo.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/metadata/blob/master/sdk/python/sample/demo.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		the real UI for workflow artifacts is minio, if you happened to portforward the minio service in the case argo artifacts store(workflow-controller) configured to used the default, otherwise there is no ui for workflow artifacts (if configured to use s3).
kubectl get configmap workflow-controller-configmap -o yaml
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;apiVersion: v1
data:
  config: |
    {
    executorImage: argoproj/argoexec:v2.3.0,
    containerRuntimeExecutor: docker,
    artifactRepository:
    {
       s3: {
            bucket: mlpipeline,
            keyPrefix: artifacts,
            endpoint: minio-service.kubeflow:9000,
            insecure: true,
            accessKeySecret: {
                name: mlpipeline-minio-artifact,
                key: accesskey
            },
            secretKeySecret: {
                name: mlpipeline-minio-artifact,
                key: secretkey
            }
        }
    }
    }
kind: ConfigMap
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

so basically the pipeline ui artifacts shows metadata artifacts, not workflow artifacts.

		the way to make workflow artifacts show in UI is &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/output-viewer/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/output-viewer/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for the investigation and the explanation, it makes sense. I'm definitely interested in a way to list the argo workflow runs artifacts (intermediate steps as well, not just final results) when they are stored in S3. I would also like to be able to link the location from the ui (using the s3:// protocol). I understand it's not there and I would have to wait for now. I will keep this open for another while just for tracking.
