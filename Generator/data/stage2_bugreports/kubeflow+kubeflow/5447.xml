	<summary>Istio-Proxy fails on Kubeflow 1.2.0</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
We recently installed Kubeflow 1.2.0 and are experiencing issues with several pods in the kubeflow namespace, of which all end up in CrashLoopBackOffs.
All these pods use istio-proxy sidecars and are very frequently (&gt; 20 messages per minute) displaying the following error message:

2020-12-07T15:31:01.582356Z     info    Envoy command: [-c /etc/istio/proxy/envoy-rev0.json --restart-epoch 0 --drain-time-s 45 --parent-shutdown-time-s 60 --service-cluster cache-deployer.kubeflow --service-node sidecar~172.17.0.20~cache-deployer-deployment-7554787d7b-gzf89.kubeflow~kubeflow.svc.cluster.local --max-obj-name-len 189 --local-address-ip-version v4 --allow-unknown-fields -l warning --component-log-level misc:error --concurrency 2]

We thus think that the istio proxy is the actual issue here.
Is this a known problem? Do we need to install additional certificates? Any kind of advice is greatly appreciated.
Anything else you would like to add:

Previous version of Kubeflow (i.e. 1.1.0 &amp; 1.0.2) are working fine
We are behind a corporate proxy and are passing the required proxy parameters to minikube's start command
All other pods in other namespaces are running fine

Environment:

Kubeflow version: latest release / v1.2.0
kfctl version: v1.2.0
Kubernetes platform: minikube v1.15.1
Kubernetes version: v1.17.0
OS: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5

		Solved after two days of debugging.
We found out that invalid JWT tokens were created by the envoy sidecars and rejected by citadel. We suspected faulty certificates to be the reason and at some point started experimenting with the minikube start command.
When we changed the flag  from

to

things (i.e. creation of valid JWTs) started working. Kudos to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/7855#issuecomment-628287907&gt;kubernetes/minikube#7855 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The official tutorial recommending former value seems to be outdated here.
