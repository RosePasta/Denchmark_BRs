	<summary>Jupyter Notebook role too permissive?</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
Kubeflow documentation states kubeflow assigns the jupyter-notebook service account to the Jupyter notebook Pods. I submitted a separate PR to update the documentation.
But I'm wondering if the permissions for the Notebooks are too permissive?  They don't seem to be scoped to a namespace.
Permissions:
kubectl describe clusterrole kubeflow-edit -n anonymous

		Use the following roles.  and  as referred here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v0.7-branch/jupyter/notebook-controller/base/cluster-role.yaml&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v0.7-branch/jupyter/notebook-controller/base/cluster-role.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Your kubectl seems to be using a different role.

		This is working as intended.
The role is a ClusterRole but we create a rolebinding (not a clusterrolebinding) so permissions are only granted in the namespace the notebook is running.
The notebook should also by default use the service account "default-editor". This has a role binding to grant permissions for all the things a user might want to do in the namespace (e.g. run notebooks, submit jobs, etc...).
