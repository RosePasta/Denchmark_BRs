	<summary>Jupyter notebook server is launched using incorrect container image</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
New deployment of Kubeflow. Created a new notebook server based on one of the provided images: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-1.15.2-notebook-cpu
Running in the notebook:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf
tf.__version__
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Outputs:
'2.4.0-dev20201011'
What did you expect to happen:
Output: '1.15.2'
Anything else you would like to add:
Absolutely perplexed. If I run the same image using docker - I get the correct version...
What am I doing wrong here?
The title is just a guess...
Environment:

Kubeflow version: v1beta1
kfctl version: (use kfctl version):
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube): bare metal cluster, deployed with Deepops
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.17
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS

		I tracked the behaviour down to one particular PV - it was only happening if that PV was mounted as the workspace. After deleting all files on PV, the behaviour stopped. It must be related to something that I was doing rather than Kubeflow.
