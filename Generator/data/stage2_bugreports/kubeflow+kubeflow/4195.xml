	<summary>kfctl on GCP failed to create the GCP cluster but kept going - issue with reconcile</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
I used kfctl on master at @663e888ac506a1b35ba495b3fa67a8fbd7f5bd61 to deploy on GCP with IAP.
GKE failed to create the cluster for some reason but kfctl kept going trying to deploy the k8s resources.
This is a bug in the way reconcile semantics are implemented in apply.



kubeflow/bootstrap/pkg/kfapp/coordinator/coordinator.go


         Line 758
      in
      663e888






 platformErr := platform.Apply(resources) 





Here if there is an error we just keep going.
I think we need to fix this by updating apply to use conditions to implement reconcile semantics and not just blindly retry on errors.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4166&gt;#4166&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 added conditions. So if the plugin fails we should probably abort.
Alternatively, kfctl kustomize.go should have some way of determining whether its pointing at the correct cluster.

		I think to fix this we will need to make use of conditions
e.g.



kubeflow/bootstrap/pkg/apis/apps/kfdef/v1beta1/application_types.go


         Line 170
      in
      4a3766b






 func GetPluginSucceededCondition(pluginKind PluginKindType) KfDefConditionType { 





We should use conditions to indicate whether a plugin is done or had an error/failed. In the event of failure we shouldn't just go on to deploying the K8s applications.
In the interim we should probably revert the original change: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4106&gt;#4106&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
