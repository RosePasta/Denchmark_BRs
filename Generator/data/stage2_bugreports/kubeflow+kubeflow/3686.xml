	<summary>[kfctl] apply on partially deployed kubeflow cluster fails;</summary>
	<description>
I  did the following

Deploy kubeflow
Delete namespace kubeflow
Rerun kfctl apply to fix kubectl

This gives the error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;couldn't apply KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Apply failed for kustomize:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: couldn't create resources from istio-install Error: Service "istio-ingressgateway" is invalid: spec.ports[1].nodePort: Invalid value: 31380: provided port is already allocate
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We should fix this; i.e catch the error and keep going.
Running kfctl apply on an already deployed Kubeflow should be idempotent for resources that already exist

		Built the kfctl binary myself from today's source code : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow.git&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow.git&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Also meet this issue, when I install kubeflow on Minikube.

		31380 conflicts with kube-proxy port, at least for on-prem.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/10795&gt;istio/istio#10795&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 identified this but left the nodePorts in there.

 Do you want to open a separate issue about the port conflict?

 I am trying the Kubeflow for the first time and ran into this issue. Wondering how do I get past this before the 0.7 is released?
Also ran into the following as well..
INFO[0021] creating StatefulSet/application-controller-stateful-set  filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:447"
Error: couldn't apply KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Apply failed for kustomize:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: couldn't create resources from application Error: no matches for kind "Application" in version "app.k8s.io/v1beta1"

@lalithvaka This looks like #3989

Thank you Jeremy &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi&gt;@jlewi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I have reviewed the 3989. kubectl get crd --&gt;  gives me a bunch from adapters to zipkins. Towards the end of the issue, I see its pointed to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3810&gt;#3810&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (comment) (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3810#issuecomment-527687504&gt;#3810 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Do you suggest I use this fix for a workaround?

kubectl get crd --&gt; gives me a bunch from adapters to zipkins.

I'm not sure what this means.
If your trying to rerun kfctl apply and hitting the issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3810&gt;#3810&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 then I would suggest following the work around in that issue.
If your issue looks like a different problem please open a new issue.

I believe the workaround seems to have worked with lot of warning msgs. I got all the KubeFlow seervices up and running. Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi&gt;@jlewi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  for all the help. Appreciate it.
