&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;About:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/prodonjs&gt;@prodonjs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 words:

There's still another problem that's always existed that I just became aware of. This screencast taken on the image from 0.6.2 demonstrates the problem. Because Pipelines and Metadata relies on hash-based routing, updating the iframe src doesn't actually force the navigation event. So, if I click on the Exit Handler pipeline, then click back, and then click on the Parallel execution pipeline, the page inside of Pipelines doesn't actually update.


The solution to this is probably to destroy and recreate the iframe whenever the user navigates away from the top-level route that activates the iframe page. I didn't have the time to implement that today but that's probably a useful thing to open an issue for.
