	<summary>Kubeflow on K8s - "kfctl apply" throws "Unknown variable: x" error ; ksonnet doesn't support K8s 1.15 or later</summary>
	<description>
I tried to install kubeflow v0.5.1 on an existing K8s "cluster" (it is a single node microk8s cluster on an Ubuntu Host) by following the instructions from this page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started-k8s/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started-k8s/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. At least for me the instructions seem to not work.
I am trying to deploy kubeflow from my laptop onto the microk8s "clsuter" which runs on a dedicated host.
However, the last command from the instructions -  - outputs just a list of errors. Except for the namespace creation nothing is deployed/created. Below an excerpt of the error which repeats itself and &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/aktivalux/9e8c0d74e6dddea8bbb815799e45ebee&gt;you can find the full output here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Used kfctl version

Used ks version
$ ks version
ksonnet version: 0.13.1
jsonnet version: v0.11.2
client-go version: kubernetes-1.10.4
I slightly changed the commands so i do not have to modify the PATH/set the KFAPP variable:
./kfctl init mykfapp
cd mykfapp
../kfctl generate all -V
../kfctl apply all -V
Additionally I am on macOS Mojave using zsh as shell.

		I am facing the same issue. I am using minikube for my k8s environment (no VM, driverless).

		Are you using kubernetes 1.15?
It looks like the error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERRO[0007] (Will retry) Component argo apply failed; Error: find objects: /Users/.../cluster-init/kubeflow/kfapp/ks_app/lib/ksonnet-lib/v1.15.0/k8s.libsonnet:17681:93-94 Unknown variable: x
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is coming from the libsonnet file that ksonnet is auto-generating. I suspect there is an error specific to the 1.15 APis.
Unfortunately since ksonnet is deprecated the fix is probably going to be to wait for 0.6 which replaces ksonnet with kustomize.

		Is there a timeline on when that will be happening? Because I've been trying to deploy Kubeflow on Minikube for the last 2 days and I'm running into issue after issue, this being one of them.

 yes I am:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Server Version: version.Info{

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have also tried using an older version of kubeflow (v0.4.1) and used the instructions available here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Azure/kubeflow-labs/tree/master/4-kubeflow&gt;https://github.com/Azure/kubeflow-labs/tree/master/4-kubeflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Unfortunately also without luck.
I am actually only interested in the TFJob Ressource. Is there any workaround available except for downgrading the k8s cluster to something below &lt;1.15?
(maybe also some other project that might provides something similiar? eventually sth. like this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/distributed-tensorflow&gt;Helm chart&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?)

		I was able to manage by downgrading to minikube 1.1 and using Kubernetes 1.14.3. This ended up causing the application to deploy but produce an error at the end, so I just re-ran the apply and it worked.

		I have the same issue. I'm installing Kubeflow on my k8s without virtual machine.
My cluster version is v1.15.0.  I tried to install KF 0.5.0 and 0.5.1 and i got "Unknown variable: x" Error.
Any suggestion such as "Downgrade to specific cluster version or use specific ks version something like that" ?

 for now you can use an older kubernetes version such as 1.14.3 or 1.14.1 (that are the versions I have tested successfully). For the rest  you can just follow the official installation instructions and use the latest version of kubeflow and ksonnet/ks.

 is the tracking bug for 0.6.
We are working on cutting the RC now.
If you are willing to live on the edge and be a beta tester, we would really appreciate help trying out master and reporting bugs.
We are using #release in kubeflow.slack.com to coordinate.
To try on master check out master and then
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd bootstrap
make build-kfctl
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I found a workaround to solve this problem.
My ENV: kubeflow 0.5.1 , k8s  1.14.4 (kind v0.4.0) Ôºåand ks 0.13.1
Before run command "kfctl apply ..." , run " kind get clusters " . then this error will disappear.
Hope this information can help you with your kubeflow deployment or help us to fix this bug.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/QxiaoQ&gt;@QxiaoQ&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'm going to close this issue.
For folks hitting this error I recommend trying Kubeflow 0.6 because the problem is that ksonnet doesn't support newer versions of Kubernetes.
If you must use an earlier version of Kubeflow you can try the workaround &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/QxiaoQ&gt;@QxiaoQ&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentions above.
