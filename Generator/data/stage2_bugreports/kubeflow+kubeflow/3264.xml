	<summary>kfctl uses app dir in app.yaml and not actual directory</summary>
	<description>
It looks like kfctl is using the application directory in app.yaml and not the directory from which kfctl is running.
This will cause problems when moving the app and when using it with source control.
Example suppose user creates the app in
somedir/myapp
and now they move it to
otherdir/myapp
Now suppose they modify the app e.g. add an NFS deployment manager config to gcp_config
To deploy user runs
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd otherdir/myapp
kfctl apply platform
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Even though kfctl is executed from otherdir/myapp it looks like its actually try to read the app from the directory specified in app.yaml
We should fix this. kfctl should respect the working directory.
In the interim, Users can work around this by updating app.yaml.

		It looks like the problem is specific to the handling of extra GCP deployment manager config files

 if _, networkStatErr := os.Stat(path.Join(gcp.Spec.AppDir, GCP_CONFIG, NETWORK_FILE)); !os.IsNotExist(networkStatErr) {

		I take that back it looks like we do it for all configs

 gcpConfigDir := path.Join(appDir, GCP_CONFIG)

		Should we just remove appDir in spec, and always use pwd?

		Without knowing a lot about kubeflow internals I think the  should go, and  should be used instead. If &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi&gt;@jlewi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and the rest of the maintainers support the idea/direction and I can find a bit of mentorship in the community I would like to take on the task of making a PR for this issue.

		I think the pattern we want to move to is using KfDef.Status to pass around temporary information in kfctl.
There should be a TODO in the code to move to AppDir into KfDef.Status.
I think it would make sense to set KfDef.Status.AppDir to CWD at suitable entry points in the code.
We should probably wait on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3515&gt;#3515&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to be submitted first.

		I believe this is no longer relevant given all the changes and improvements to kfctl.
