	<summary>Profile doesn't work with Group ownership</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I have kubeflow auth setup with dex and okta saml connector. Things works perfectly for user owned profiles.
However, when I create profile with the owner as a Group. e.g.
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1beta1
kind: Profile
metadata:
name: group1-profile
spec:
owner:
kind: Group
name: group1
I'm not able to get this to work although I see groups attribute coming back correctly in the saml. So even if the user has group "group1", I don't see that profile available for them in the profile drop-down list in the UI.
What did you expect to happen:
User have access to group1-profile because it is owned by Group "group1" and user belongs to that group.
Anything else you would like to add:
N/A
