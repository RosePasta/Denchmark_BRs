	<summary>Error When Installing Kubeflow on Azure AKS</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
I'm following the instructions here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/deploy/install-kubeflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to install kubeflow on Aks. Everything works until this step .
This Error keeps pop up with retries and eventually failed:
WARN[0008] Encountered error applying application istio:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: Apply.Run : unable to recognize "/tmp/kout554230921": no matches for kind "ClusterRbacConfig" in version "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"  filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:266"
WARN[0008] Will retry in 2 seconds.                      filename="kustomize/kustomize.go:267"
What did you expect to happen:
I'm expecting Kubeflow to be correctly installed on AKS

 currently it only works with 1.6.X (if you edit the manifest file you'll see that as a comment) -- I tested with 1.6.14. We're looking into why it doesn't work with Istio 1.7.X. I encountered similar problems myself. Will also make sure we call this out more in the documentation.

 FYI. I too was seeing issues like this with deploying Kubeflow to AKS with Istio 1.7.3 (which I installed via Istio operator)

		The program will keep retrying and receiving the following error:

		It turned out my issue was due to resources under cert-manager namespace was incorrectly installed. It disappeared once I fixed the installation issue in cert-manager namespace

 out of curious in which namespace was cert-manager installed? I double-checked though it appears it should install in  namespace automatically.
