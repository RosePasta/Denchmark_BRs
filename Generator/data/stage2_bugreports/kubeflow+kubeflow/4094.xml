	<summary>Namespace select only shows kubeflow-anonymous</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:

Open dashboard
Try to select a namespace

The dropdown contents flash for a moment and then only show a single entry: kubeflow-anonymous.
See this video for a demo:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.loom.com/share/70a896c7fe9948fe82cabb58221107c4&gt;https://www.loom.com/share/70a896c7fe9948fe82cabb58221107c4&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
In my previous use of Kubeflow, there were a number of namespaces.
Anything else you would like to add:
During  the behavior described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4087&gt;#4087&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 occurred. The operation exited with code 1 and the env eventually started (verify using  that all pods a running).
After a hard (cache clearning) page reload, I did not see any messages in the browser Console, nor did I see any non 2xx responses in Networks.
The payload of /api/env-info is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;{
  "user": "anonymous@kubeflow.org",
  "platform": {
    "kubeflowVersion": "v0.6.2",
    "provider": "other://",
    "providerName": "other"
  },
  "namespaces": [
  {
    "namespace": "kubeflow-anonymous",
    "role": "contributor",
    "user": "anonymous@kubeflow.org"
  }
  ],
  "isClusterAdmin": true
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I see events for the kubeflow by opening the page with the path /activity?ns=kubeflow (i.e. manually editing the namespace in the browser URL).
Environment:

Kubeflow version: v0.6.2
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): v0.6.2-0-g47a0e4c7
Kubernetes platform: microk8s
Kubernetes version: v1.15.3
OS: Linux kubeflow 4.15.0-58-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP

		I believe v0.6.2 only shows kubeflow-anonymous under namespace on initial deployment. It will then only show namespaces associated with user profiles created. &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I do agree with the UX comment in the video when creating a new notebook server for the first time and trying to edit the namespace from the namespace box when you're suppose to have selected it from the top drop down.

		There's a lot of (log) activity under the 'kubeflow' namespace in 0.6.2.
The only way to view that, that I can tell, is to hack the URL
(`?ns=kubeflow`).

		As it stands, this seems to be the behavior that is expected for namespaces (in terms of the list you can see)
/cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kunmingg&gt;@kunmingg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abhi-g&gt;@abhi-g&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In terms of the UX for notebooks, I agree, we could make this more intuitive (cc: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ajayalfred&gt;@ajayalfred&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kimwnasptd&gt;@kimwnasptd&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 PTAL).
Thanks!

		If the kubeflow namespace isn't in the list, how is a user supposed to view the activity associated with that namespace?

		<comment id='6' author='gar1t' date='2019-09-18T20:59:41Z'>
		Starting at v0.6.2, kubeflow namespace will be for infra services like controllers.
User can create notebooks or deploying workloads in their own namespace.
If identity-aware-proxy is not setup, the default user namespace is kubeflow-anonymous

		That makes sense. But what if someone wants to to view infra activity - for whatever reason?

		<comment id='8' author='gar1t' date='2019-09-18T21:14:44Z'>
		The infra activity for Kubeflow namespace deployments should be accessible
via the K8s dashboard in general, or on GKE Hub on GKE.

		If you wanted to look at the kubeflow namespace you can also use kubectl

		Hi, i am using v0.6.2 and using a notebook server in my namespace to write a pipeline function using the Kubeflow Pipelines DSL with reference &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. i am also specifying the notebook server's pvc name with kfp.onprem.mount_pvc method to store the output to notebook server's directory. when i compile the code i get the link to experiment and run, but the run is in pending state with volume claim not found message.
i know the reason is that the pipelines are being created in kubeflow namespace and not in the notebook's namespace.
am i doing it the wrong way or is it the expected functionality as of now?
