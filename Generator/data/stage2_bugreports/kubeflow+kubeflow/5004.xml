	<summary>Email validation regex is too restrictive</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Attempted to add a contributor with an email address on a .network domain. Received "Contributor doesn't look like a valid email address"
What did you expect to happen:
User is added as normal.
Anything else you would like to add:
This regex: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/centraldashboard/app/api_workgroup.ts#L11-L12&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/centraldashboard/app/api_workgroup.ts#L11-L12&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is used to validate emails, and is too simple. It demands that your TLD contains only 2 or 3 characters, which rejects many valid domains.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: (use kfctl version):
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube)
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version):
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):

		Did you try adding the user directly by creating appropriate RBAC and ISTIORBAC resources?
