	<summary>User example@domain.com is not authorized to list .v1.namespaces for namespace: None</summary>

/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:


Deploy Kubeflow with KFDef kfctl_istio_dex.v1.0.2 


Login to the Kubeflow dashboard through Dex OIDC and navigate to Notebooks Servers page


A snack bar pops out showing User example@domain.com is not authorized to list .v1.namespaces for namespace: None


But all functions afterwards work normally.
What did you expect to happen:
Showing no error.
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]
Pod jupyter-web-app-deployment logs show
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;10.233.104.162 - - [30/May/2020 02:18:11] "GET /api/namespaces HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.233.104.162 - - [30/May/2020 02:18:11] "GET /api/namespaces/&lt;namespace&gt;/notebooks HTTP/1.1" 200 -
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I've tried to trace a bit the source codes. It seems to me that the called &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/jupyter-web-app/backend/kubeflow_jupyter/common/base_app.py#L81-L90&gt;function&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 decorated by an authorization check &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/jupyter-web-app/backend/kubeflow_jupyter/common/api.py#L139-L144&gt;function&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will anyway return an error &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/a49f658f047f83b634365a238c6a2ba2baa97c9d/components/jupyter-web-app/backend/kubeflow_jupyter/common/auth.py#L99-L102&gt;json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, since there is no namespace argument passed in so the namespace is  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/a49f658f047f83b634365a238c6a2ba2baa97c9d/components/jupyter-web-app/backend/kubeflow_jupyter/common/auth.py#L89&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I was also wondering why /api/namespaces needs to be called here?
Environment:

Kubeflow version: build version dev_local
kfctl version: v1.0.2 (run as Kubeflow operator)
Kubernetes platform: on-prem
Kubernetes version: v1.15.3
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS

 I face the same issue. And also may I know whether you face the "RBAC: access denied" issue(the web page shows RBAC: access denied information) several minutes after logining through Dex OIDC? Thanks.

		If no one decides to look at a problem, does not make it a non-problem.  Letting your bot close issues simply because no one has the cycles to research them is problematic.  I'm facing this problem and it seems to reveal a larger issue under the hood.  But I don't read go code to figure out what's going on.
