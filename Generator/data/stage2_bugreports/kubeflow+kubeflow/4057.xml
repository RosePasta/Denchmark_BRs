	<summary>"Couldn't copy application istio-ingress" error during kfctl generate on EKS</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
Followed documentation for deploying Kubeflow on AWS &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Created EKS cluster using eksctl beforehand
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ eksctl create cluster \
--name demo02 \
--version 1.13 \
--nodegroup-name standard-workers \
--node-type t3.medium \
--nodes 3 \
--nodes-min 1 \
--nodes-max 4 \
--node-ami auto
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Completed steps 1 and 2 for fetching kfctl v0.6.2, editing kfctl_aws.yaml with IAM role name
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ aws iam list-roles \
   | jq -r ".Roles[] \
   | select(.RoleName \
   | startswith(\"eksctl-$AWS_CLUSTER_NAME\") and contains(\"NodeInstanceRole\")) \
   .RoleName"

eksctl-demo02-nodegroup-standard-NodeInstanceRole-RBG4TXIX840Q
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Received error on step 3 when running kfctl generate all -V
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error: couldn't generate KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Generate failed for kustomize: kustomize generate failed Error:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: couldn't copy application istio-ingress
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
kfctl generate all should not throw error
Anything else you would like to add:
First attempt running KF on AWS so appreciate any advice or guides in case missing something obvious.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): v0.6.2
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube) : AWS
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.13
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release):

		Getting the same thing. I'm wondering if it's related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/221&gt;kubeflow/manifests#221&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and wondering if I can just mkdir and just copy all the base files into a folder under ${KFAPP}/kustomize/istio-ingress

		I think this is an issue with a mismatch between the kubeflow/manifests master and the v0.6-branch archives.
Master has recently merged istio-ingress manifests under an aws subfolder. I found I was able to generate if I modified my kfctl_aws.yaml config file to specify :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;repos:
    - name: kubeflow
      root: kubeflow-0.6-branch
      uri: https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/archive/v0.6-branch.tar.gz
    - name: manifests
      root: manifests-0.6-branch
      uri: https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/master.tar.gz

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gigi-at-zymergen&gt;@gigi-at-zymergen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the able to get it working through this suggestion

		Confirming that modifying kfctl_aws.yaml as suggested by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gigi-at-zymergen&gt;@gigi-at-zymergen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 results in generate completing with errors. Not sure if this is an expected step on behalf of user. If so, I can close and move this comment to the aws documentation

		Pretty sure this is not expected and due to different release cycles and mismatch in versioning/branches for manifests repo vs. the currently released kfctl_aws.yaml file. Probably need to merge master into the v0.6-branch of the manifests repo.
