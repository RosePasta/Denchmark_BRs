	<summary>gcp.go should assert error is of type kfError before accessing its fields</summary>
	<description>
We have lots of code like this



kubeflow/bootstrap/pkg/kfapp/gcp/gcp.go


         Line 832
      in
      bb4d1d9






 return &amp;kfapis.KfError{ 





&lt;denchmark-code&gt;return  &amp;kfapis.KfError{
			Code: secretsErr.(*kfapis.KfError).Code,
			Message: fmt.Sprintf("gcp apply could not create secrets Error %v",
				secretsErr.(*kfapis.KfError).Message),
		}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is unsafe because this will segfault if the error fails the assertion.
We should be more defensive.
In a forthcoming PR I will add a method like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;func NewKfErrorWithMessage(e error, msg string) error {
	kErr, ok := e.(*KfError)

	if !ok {
		log.Infof("Error is not a KfError; %v", e)

		return &amp;KfError{
			Code:    int(UNKNOWN),
			Message: msg + "; " +  e.Error(),
		}
	}
	return &amp;KfError{
		Code:    kErr.Code,
		Message: msg + "; " + kErr.Message,
	}
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which can be used to replace the existing code.
Filing this issue to track actually updating the code.
