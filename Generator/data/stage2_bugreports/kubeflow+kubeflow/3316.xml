	<summary>`kfctl.sh apply platform` on EKS fails if automatically selected availability zone has no capacity</summary>
	<description>
When running kfctl.sh apply platform on EKS, kfctl appears to automatically select which availabililty zones it will use. Sometimes one of the selected availability zone does not have capacity, leading to the error below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Cannot create cluster 'kubeflow-aws' because us-east-1e, the targeted availability zone, does not currently have sufficient capacity to support the cluster. Retry and choose from these availability zoneseast-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1d, us-east-1f
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The expected behaviour should surely be that kfctl will only select availability zones that currently do have capacity?

 This is a problem on eksctl. I would suggest you to control availability zones manually in eksctl cluster config file. Please use AZs a b c for large region.
See this



kubeflow/deployment/aws/infra_configs/cluster_config.yaml

 # If your region has multiple availability zones, you can specify 3 of them. 



 #availabilityZones: ["us-west-2b", "us-west-2c", "us-west-2d"]
