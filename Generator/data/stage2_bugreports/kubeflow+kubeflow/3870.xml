	<summary>No Namespaces in Central Dashboard</summary>
	<description>
Kubeflow Dashboard doesn't have any Namespace in the dropdown. I've already gone through this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/159/commits/273395ad7a45338815827f72dfda7348e32ad0f0&gt;fix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but it wasn't required since the yaml files in 0.6.1 version already includes those additions which have been suggested in the fix.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: v0.6.1-rc.2-1-g3a37cbc6
Kubernetes version: 1.13

		I have the same issue here. I found that I'm using the file &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/master/bootstrap/config/kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml&gt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/master/bootstrap/config/kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as the config file for the  stage. This file makes Kubeflow always pull the head version from the repository which could be broken by frequent commits.
...
spec:
  repos:
  - name: manifests
    root: manifests-master
    uri: https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/master.tar.gz
  - name: kubeflow
    root: kubeflow-master
    uri: https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/archive/master.tar.gz
...
I changed the URLs to point at a defined release version from the repository, then continue with the kfctl generate and kfctl apply stages and it worked for me:
...
spec:
  repos:
  - name: manifests
    root: manifests-master
    uri: https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/v0.6.1.tar.gz
  - name: kubeflow
    root: kubeflow-master
    uri: https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/archive/v0.6.1.tar.gz
...
Hope it helps.

 Thank you very much, it worked! I am following this &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I had to change the config file name "kfctl_aws.yaml". Specified the versions like you directed and the namespaces started showing up. Thanks alot!

		It doesn't work for me with 0.6.1 releases of  manifests and kubeflow:
Error: couldn't generate KfApp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: kfApp Generate failed for kustomize: kustomize generate failed Error:  (kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: couldn't copy application istio-ingress 
Is seems that  is missing in manifests but is referred from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/v0.6-branch/bootstrap/config/kfctl_aws.yaml&gt;kfctl_aws.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in 0.6 branch.
In fact the whole  folder was added later and didn't make it to  manifests release. See the 0.6 branch state of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/v0.6-branch&gt;manifests&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

How come it worked for you?

0.6.1 was not working for me either; It didn't even deploy to start with and I couldn't reach the Dashboard. I used &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases/tag/v0.6.1-rc.2&gt;v0.6.1-rc.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it worked fine. I am not sure about your issue but what I was facing with v0.6.1-rc.2 was that in the Dashboard there were no Namespaces in the dropdown. What I did was, as directed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dss77&gt;@dss77&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I changed the versions like this "&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/v0.6.1-rc.2.tar.gz&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/v0.6.1-rc.2.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
" in the suggested lines and it worked for me.
Also, while we are on the subject, another issue I faced with v0.6.1-rc.2  was that the jupyter notebook wouldn't launch. I executed this line to make it work:
kubectl -n kubeflow create serviceaccount default-editor --dry-run=true -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

 Thanks. It worked with v0.6.1-rc.2. It is a version from master branch while 0.6.1 is from the v0.6-branch. So confusing. Thanks a lot.

: I hope you are using Kubeflow's official installation guide. If yes then please follow &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dss77&gt;@dss77&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's answer that is at the top of this post. Make sure you have changed the versions from master to 0.6.1-rc.2 in the kfctl_config.yaml file like this:

Give it a fresh try and see if it works.

: Your links suggest you are working on your local system? I worked on AWS and its guide worked fine. If you are also on AWS then ping me on Skype (sheharyar_pointman) and I'll share a step-by-by guide I compiled during my journey.
