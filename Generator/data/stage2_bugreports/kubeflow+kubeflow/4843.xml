	<summary>Profile controller's AwsIamForServiceAccount plugin is not recognized</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

I deployed Kubeflow on EKS using the instructions outlined in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I then created a profile that should have access to an IAM role using the following template:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1beta1
kind: Profile
metadata:
  name: kubeflow-anonymous
spec:
  owner:
    kind: User
    name: anonymous@kubeflow.org
  plugins:
  - kind: AwsIamForServiceAccount
    spec:
      awsIamRole: arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXX:role/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, the IAM plugin for profile controller appears to be unavailable based on the controller's logs:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;INFO  controllers.Profile  Plugin not recgonized:  {"profile": "kubeflow-anonymous", "Kind": "AwsIamForServiceAccount"}
INFO  controllers.Profile  Plugin not recgonized:  {"profile": "kubeflow-anonymous", "Kind": "AwsIamForServiceAccount"}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I looked at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/v1.0.0.tar.gz&gt;manifest&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 used by kfctl and it seems the controller's image is quite old: gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/profile-controller:v20190619-v0-219-gbd3daa8c-dirty-1ced0e
Support for IAM roles was added in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4751&gt;#4751&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 a few weeks ago before the release of v1.0, and I thought it made it into the release. Maybe I got it wrong?
What did you expect to happen:
I expected a profile to be created configured with a service account that has the permissions granted via the IAM role.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 1.0
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): v1.0-0-g94c35cf
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube): AWS
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): v1.17.3
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): macOS Mojave
