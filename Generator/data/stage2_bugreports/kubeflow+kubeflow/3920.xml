/kind question
Related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3901&gt;#3901&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have a couple of questions regarding setup-minikube.sh
Question:

 Why does ksonnet fixed to version 0.11.0? ok, kuztomize to replace it.
 Can version above be used?
 Why does install use binary version from github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet instead of using brew as it does for kubectl? See L42-l63
[  ] Why does brew existance isn't checked, and fallback install provided?
 Should installer check for ksonnet or for kustomize? (i am new to kubeflow, but this issue referenced in #3901).
[  ] Can I add case of OSX ssytem with coreutils and gnutls installed?

nproc available if coreutils installed.
osx's df -g . not available if gnutls installed. PR#3922



I can prepare fix and add resolving for all these parts if you don't mind. But I need answers at least for some of the questions.
update:
ksonnet is deprecated. I got this.

		setup-minikube.sh is very outdated and probably needs to be updated on master to work with 0.6

 Are you working on this?

 If you want to add special if statements for OSX I think that's fine.

		I am trying to get it updated. The script already has some osx related
sections. Feel free to update if necessary.

		I see.
Let me dive a bit more into kubeflow project. I really see that it's in transform phase (like setup-minikube.sh isn't helpful at all at this moment), due to a change package manager from ksonnet to kustomize. I will try to keep my on it in the next two weeks.
