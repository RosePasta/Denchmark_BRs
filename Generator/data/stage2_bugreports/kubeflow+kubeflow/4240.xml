What steps did you take and what happened:
Download kfctl_gcp_iap.yaml , replace the email key with my e-mail username, add project:  as the last key as indicated in the "Project should be set to the GCP project you want to use." comment. Run kfctl apply. Receive error project is not configured.

Either applying of kubeflow, or at least an error indicating where to configure the project.
Anything else you would like to add:
[Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]

The problem appears to be different from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3923&gt;#3923&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In particular, kfctl doesn't appear to respect the email, project, and zone set in the KFDef.
The E2E test is setting the EMAIL and PROJECT environment variable which isn't what it should be doing



kubeflow/py/kubeflow/kubeflow/ci/kfctl_go_test_utils.py


         Line 211
      in
      9592b48






 os.environ["EMAIL"] = email 





This was changed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4040&gt;#4040&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which defined the new "-f" flag.
