	<summary>JupyterHub authenticates login but doesn't redirect to user home</summary>
	<description>
Steps to reproduce issue:

Follow the Kubeflow Setup tutorial and apply default configuration.
Expose tf-hub-lb service as NodePort: ks param set kubeflow-core jupyterHubServiceType NodePort
Jupyter Hub login screen prompts but after authentication it just reloads the blank login screen.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Jupyter Hub instance Pod logs:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl logs tf-hub-0 -n kubeflow

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I figured the   may indicate where the issue's coming from, already checked  output (attached) but wasn't able to spot any errors. Should I perhaps have modified any configuration parameters because of exposing the service as NodePort? Thanks in advance.

		Did you mean ks param set kubeflow-core jupyterHubServiceType NodePort? The command you gave should have been caught as an error by ksonnet.
ERROR Could not find component identifier 'tf-hub-lb'
Perhaps check your version of ks (mine is v0.8.0) and regenerate the app per the instructions. At any rate, setting the param on kubeflow-core and applying that component results in a working NodePort for the hub load balancer and spawned a server for me. HIH

		Absolutely, my bad. I'll edit my post with the correct command.
My ksonnet version is 0.9.1, I will perform a downgrade to 0.8.0 and update the issue. Thanks!

		Is it possible your browser is blocking cookies? JH needs to set session cookies, and I can replicate what you're describing by enabling that security measure. The dummy login just reloads the login page with empty fields.

		I am now using ksonnet version 0.8.0 but the problem persists. I have noticed that, after a successful login, Jupyter Hub doesn't redirect to the user's home:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[I 2018-03-15 10:12:10.019 JupyterHub log:122] 302 POST /hub/login?next= → /hub/ (@a.b.c.d) 78.56ms
[I 2018-03-15 10:12:10.076 JupyterHub log:122] 302 GET /hub/ → /hub/login (@a.b.c.d) 0.85ms 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Instead, it reloads the login screen.
It seems the problem lies in the CHP configuration, I'll try to troubleshoot some more and post results. Has anyone experienced similar issues?

		Checked Chrome's privacy settings and I already allow cookies (also third-party). However, the proxy works correcly on Firefox, so it may have something to do with its configuration. On a side note, I also deployed Jupyter Hub via Helm following the '&lt;denchmark-link:http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;Zero to JupyterHub&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
' tutorial some weeks ago and experienced no problems accessing the UI on both browsers.

		BTW, going back to ks 0.9.1 should be fine. Works for me.

		What is the CHP configuration?

		@patricia92fa What is the status of this? Were you able to get it fixed or work around it?

		@patricia92fa Are you still blocked by this issue?

If so, what's the status now?
If not, please attach your solution to help others who face with the same trouble.
