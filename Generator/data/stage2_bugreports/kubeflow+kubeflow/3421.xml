	<summary>Terminal of Jupyter Notebooks from jupyter not working.</summary>
	<description>
I've just made a new fresh installation of kubeflow in  brand new AWS EKS cluster with kubeflow 0.5.1. When I start a new jupyter server I can't open a new terminal.

		So your able to access the Jupyter UI but when you click new terminal in the Jupyter UI nothing happens
Can you please provide the spec of the notebook
List the notebooks
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubect get notebeook
kubectl get -o yaml notebook &lt;YOUR NOTEBOOK&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Upload the YAML to the issue.
You can get the logs for the associated notebook pod
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl logs &lt;YOUR NOTEBOOK&gt;-0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can you upload those to the issue as well please?
Does the chrome JS console show any errors when you try to start a new terminal?

We back port few changes to v0.5.1 and update official documentation. I've tested istio parts it looks good to me. Please have another test and let me know if your issue is resolved

		I was using kubeflow v0.5.1 when this issue happened. But somewhat the terminal got back working. I will reopen this issue if the problem gets back.
