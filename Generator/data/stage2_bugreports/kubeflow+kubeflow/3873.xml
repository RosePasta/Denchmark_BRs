	<summary>KF 0.6: 'configurations' missing from spawner_ui_config.yaml</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

Posting this to help others who may face this issue + hopefully get a quick fix on this
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kimwnasptd&gt;@kimwnasptd&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I deployed Kubeflow 0.6 by following the ISTIO method (&lt;denchmark-link:https://master.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&gt;https://master.kubeflow.org/docs/started/k8s/kfctl-k8s-istio/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
Most things deployed correctly, but trying to create a server in the Jupyter web app was throwing a Key Error for defaults['configurations'] . I found the fix as well, just simply added an empty value for that key in the spawner_ui_config.yaml for example:
  configurations:\n    # fake input to bypass error\n    value: \"[]\"\n
Thanks

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abbyearnin&gt;@abbyearnin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

By taking a look at the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/config/kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml&gt;kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I see that it uses this uri for the manifests:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/archive/master.tar.gz
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When I untar it, the config that gets deployed for the jupyter-web-app (manifests-master/jupyter/jupyter-web-app/base/config-map.yaml) has this key.
Was the cluster that you used kfctl on a clean one or did it have a previous installation of kubeflow?
