/kind bug

[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
I am trying to deploy kubeflow on prem openshift cluster using  ksonnet
the issue looks similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3441&gt;#3441&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 though I am not getting cert error in the logs however it says self signed certificate in certificate chain. There is no other errors in the centraldashboard or notebook logs.
What did you expect to happen:
In Central dashboard when you click on new server , it would have opened page to select image however it is giving error The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.
Anything else you would like to add:

		I was able to fix above issue .. it was related to storageclass.. one of the storageclass was not having any annotations and it had an error in jupyter-web-app, somehow I missed that. However now after connecting to tensorflow notebook (tensorflow-1.13.1-notebook-cpu)  when I launch python notebook, it gives error: A connection to the notebook server could not be established. The notebook will continue trying to reconnect. Check your network connection or notebook server configuration.
shows following in chrome devtools. There is no error in pod.
kernel.js:461 WebSocket connection to 'ws://ambassador-kubeflow.devgpu.tent.trt.csaa.pri/notebook/kubeflow/user1/api/kernels/faf4a293-c4dc-4352-bdf2-c20518bb5452/channels?session_id=a100a48bbf3749d181ae7a6fc8095afc' failed: Error during WebSocket handshake: net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET

		what kfctl version are you using?
we don't support ksonnet in v0.6+ - did you try using kubeflow/manifests/jupyter?

		I was able to resolve the issue by configuring ambassador service with nodeport instead of using clusterip.
