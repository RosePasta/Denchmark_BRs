	<summary>Seldon-Core Quickstart is not working</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

After Installing Kubeflow in GKE, everything works fine part from Seldon.
I am following the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/serving/seldon/#simple-example&gt;quickstart example in Kubeflow Docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so I am:

adding the new namespace
adding a new istio gateway
deploying the dummy model
port-forwarding

when I send my prediction with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -s -d '{"data": {"ndarray":[[1.0, 2.0, 5.0]]}}'    -X POST http://localhost:8004/seldon/testseldon/seldon-model/api/v1.0/predictions    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I get:
Origin authentication failed
Inspecting the Logs of istio ingress-gateway I can see that the returned error code is 401 - Unauthorized so I think the problem is at istio ingress-gateway level.
I've tried several times with different Kubeflow versions but I am still getting the same error.
Environment:

Kubeflow version: 1.0.1
kfctl version: kfctl v1.0.1-0-gf3edb9b
Kubernetes platform: GKE
Kubernetes version: 1.14.10

		Are you using any kind of authentication service?
I posted a similar issue just now for AWS.
It says here for port forwarding that authentication can be an issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/overview/#using-kubectl-and-port-forwarding&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/central-dash/overview/#using-kubectl-and-port-forwarding&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yes I am using Google Identity Aware proxy when interacting with the endpoint.

		I've found a solution for the problem.
The request needs to be sent with IAP authentication (JWT token).
For that is possible to use a Python script similar to what suggested in the tensorflow serving page:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/serving/tfserving_new/#sending-prediction-request-through-ingress-and-iap&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/serving/tfserving_new/#sending-prediction-request-through-ingress-and-iap&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Something similar to the page I linked above can be done also for the Seldon Quickstart.

		I can update the docs but looks like a lot of that script is generic IAP processing. I could try to generalize it and add a Seldon specific addition?

		The only thing I've changed in the script is adding
Content: application/json to the headers of the request.

		I'm getting the same issue even with the Python script. I've created a separate service account with access to all that is related to IAP. Could you please provide more details on how did you fix that?

		It's because of the wrong service account. You need to add more permissions. Try the following: IAP-secured Web App User,
ML Engine Admin
