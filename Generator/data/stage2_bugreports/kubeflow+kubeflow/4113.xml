	<summary>Dashboard deployed on eks does not show manage contributors in navigation</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

Following documentation on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/deploy/install-kubeflow/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Successfully completed step 5 and proceeded to post installation step of creating user profiles. However, noticed that the dashboard deployed does not match the dashboard shown in docs at &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/multi-user-overview/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The dashboard deployed on our cluster shows  in the bottom left corner with no manage contributors tab available on the side navigation
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11370398/64735984-79821400-d49e-11e9-989e-7bd32e2bc11f.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
Expected to have the dashboard corresponding to build version v0.6.2 with the manage contributors tab on the menu available
Anything else you would like to add:
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard): v1beta1
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): v0.6.2
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube) AWS EKS
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): v1.15.3 (client), v1.13.10-eks-5ac0f1 (server)
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): darwin

		The version problem is because of this change,
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/commit/6dc0c0d10a8060ff748a74da650776da1ba4e3b7#diff-e23ef4b176ec21de1d67c8de4789720d&gt;kubeflow/manifests@6dc0c0d#diff-e23ef4b176ec21de1d67c8de4789720d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Actually the master version is v1beta1 and 0.6-branch is isv0.6.2. Since you use master manifest, then you see v1beta1 there.

		I cherry-pick &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/360&gt;kubeflow/manifests#360&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to 0.6-branch and once you use 0.6-branch for manifest repo. This issue should be resolved automatically.

		For Manage Contributors, it's invisible because of



kubeflow/components/centraldashboard/public/components/main-page.js


        Lines 197 to 202
      in
      64f4f79






 const {user, hasWorkgroup, hasAuth} = ev.detail.response; 



 this._setIsolationMode(hasAuth ? 'multi-user' : 'single-user'); 



 if (hasAuth &amp;&amp; !hasWorkgroup) { 



 this.user = user; 



 this._setRegistrationFlow(true); 



 }

     aside.divider 



     a(href$='[[buildHref("/manage-users", queryParams)]]', tabindex='-1') 



         paper-item.menu-item Manage Contributors 





Aws deployment is still being considered as  at this moment and I will make some improvements on profile env to enable this feature. Thank you for reporting,

		Not sure it's related since I am installing Kubeflow using kfctl_k8s_istio.0.6.2.yaml, centraldashboardversion image is v20190823-v0.6.0-rc.0-69-gcb7dab59 in the UI it shows v0.6.2, but we also don't have Manage Contributors

only multi-user case will enable Manage Contributors. v20190823-v0.6.0-rc.0-69-gcb7dab59 already has this feature

		I understand, I do use profiles and it seems multi-user works but “Manage contributors” is not available. Should I create a separate issue?

		do we have a path to close this issue in v0.7?

 I am evaluating the gap and I will try to close it before we cut branch
