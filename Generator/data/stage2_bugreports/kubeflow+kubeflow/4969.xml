	<summary>GRPC Auth problem with GCP IAP</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
Hi all,
Working with Google Cloud and Kubeflow, I would like to establish a GRPC connection with a pod in my cluster.
My current setup includes a  configured with &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/concepts-overview&gt;Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as authorization layer.
I already have in place a virtual service to redirect my traffic from the ingress-gateway to the GRPC pod port.
When I local port-forward to my ingress-gateway http2 port, I am unable to send requests getting the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;grpc._channel._InactiveRpcError: &lt;_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:
        status = StatusCode.UNAUTHENTICATED
        details = "Origin authentication failed"
        debug_error_string = "{"created":"@1587401119.875413000","description":"Error received from peer ipv6:[::1]:8080","file":"src/core/lib/surface/call.cc","file_line":1056,"grpc_message":"Origin authentication failed","grpc_status":16}"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

From the error code I can notice that is a problem in authenticating my GRPC Channel.
The problem looks even stranger when I look to my ingress-gateway logs, where I can see the following for my failed request:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"POST /seldon.protos.Seldon/Predict HTTP/2" 200 - "-" 0 0 0 - "10.52.7.24" "grpc-python/1.27.2 grpc-c/9.0.0 (osx; chttp2; guantao)"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

which in the logs looks successful.
My current security policy is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;apiVersion: authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |

  targets:
  - name: istio-ingressgateway
    ports:
    - number: 80
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Using REST I was able to authenticate successfully my requests, adding a token to my request following what described &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto#authenticating_from_a_service_account&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I've tried various ways to authenticate my requests in GRPC with no success:

https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/#authenticate-with-google-using-a-jwt
https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/#authenticate-with-google-using-an-oauth2-token
Adding as metadata of the request ('authentication', 'Bearer {}'.format(token)

Is there any example in creating a secure channel with Cloud IAP?
Many Thanks
Environment:
Kubeflow version: 1.0.1
kfctl version: kfctl v1.0.1-0-gf3edb9b
Kubernetes platform: GKE
Kubernetes version: 1.14.10

		The ISTIO Gateway is configured with a security policy that checks for a valid JWT that is attached by IAP. This is required to ensure traffic went through IAP.
So if you port-forward to the ISTIO ingress gateway you will get an authenticated error because you don't have a valid JWT.
You can check out the policy here.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;kubectl -n istio-system get policy -o yaml ingressjwt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

You can check out the ISTIO docs to learn more about policies and how to possible configure exceptions.
If you are trying to send traffic to your cluster you can route that over the external endpoint and go through IAP (see the &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authentication-howto&gt;IAP docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi&gt;@jlewi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
The issue I am having is only happening when I try to send a gRPC request with a  JWT IAP token.  The same thing doesn't happen using REST JSON.
It's like Istio is not able to check the JWT when my request is sent trough gRPC.
The problem is not caused because I am port-forwarding.
Can you provide an example of an authenticated IAP gRPC request to the Kubeflow endpoint?

Sounds like it might not be an issue with Kubeflow but an issue with ISTIO and gRPC. I have you searched the ISTIO forums to see if this is a known issue?
