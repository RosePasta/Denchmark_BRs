	<summary>[Central Dashboard] Shows user as anyonmous@kubeflow.org when logged in via IAP</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
[A clear and concise description of what the bug is.]
I'm logged into Kubeflow 0.6.2  (RC 0.2) using this &lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/c3199d931b9b82c8717057c7aca883d76bb5e1d5/bootstrap/config/kfctl_gcp_iap.0.6.2rc.yaml&gt;kfctl_gcp_iap.0.6.rc.2.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. When I log into the central dashboard via IAP it is showing I am .
This looks like a bug in the kustomize manifest. It doesn't look like the environment variables USERID_HEADER is set correctly.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  - env:
    - name: USERID_HEADER
      value: $(userid-header)
    - name: USERID_PREFIX
      value: $(userid-prefix)
    - name: PROFILES_KFAM_SERVICE_HOST
      value: profiles-kfam.kubeflow
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

See: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3900#issuecomment-524343425&gt;#3900 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Full pod spec is attached
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/files/3535036/centraldashboard.spec.yaml.txt&gt;centraldashboard.spec.yaml.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avdaredevil&gt;@avdaredevil&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 What is impacted by the failure to set USERID_HEADER and PREFIX correctly? Is it just which user is displayed in the centraldashboard? Does it have any impact on the profiles users will see.

		It looks like this breaks the automatic profile creation login when I login as a different user.
&lt;denchmark-link:http://bit.ly/2ZgOE1v&gt;http://bit.ly/2ZgOE1v&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I login as a different user it thinks I'm &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:anonymous@kubeflow.org&gt;anonymous@kubeflow.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so doesn't redirect me through the login flow.

		It looks like the configuration file on the branch is different from the one on master
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v0.6-branch/common/centraldashboard/base/params.yaml&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v0.6-branch/common/centraldashboard/base/params.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/common/centraldashboard/base/params.yaml&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/master/common/centraldashboard/base/params.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We are missing the section
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;- path: spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value
  kind: Deployment
- path: spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/1/value
  kind: Deployment
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think that means we are overriding the default targets for variable substitution since we are specifying a configuraiton file. But since we didn't include all of the defaults we are no longer substituting into environment variables for deployments.

		I'm stumped. Running kustomize build in kubeflow/manifests common/centraldashboard/base seems to generate the correct value but when I run it in ${KFAPP}/kustomize/centraldashboard/
it doesn't get substituted.

		Ok it looks like the problem might be that we are missing vars references for userid-header and userid-prefix in kustomization.yaml
Compare what's on master
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/76bd875d65d39960ab2d75daa2ba2b7a2a9e82a4/common/centraldashboard/base/kustomization.yaml#L38&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/76bd875d65d39960ab2d75daa2ba2b7a2a9e82a4/common/centraldashboard/base/kustomization.yaml#L38&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To what's on 0.6
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/104c5b8c8e1df2bd09a827c4e25295ce945e3459/common/centraldashboard/base/kustomization.yaml#L23&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/104c5b8c8e1df2bd09a827c4e25295ce945e3459/common/centraldashboard/base/kustomization.yaml#L23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

So here's what I think we are doing.

We are defining a configmap named params from params.env
We are defining vars inside kustomization.yaml whose values will be set by the configmap generated from params.env
We need to specify a configuration file params.yaml  because we want the targets for variable substitution to include ISTIO virtual services and those are not targets by default

		It looks like if we define vars that aren't in the config map we get an error so we should probably set default values in params.yaml to the empty string.
Do we need to include the lines
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;- path: spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value
  kind: Deployment
- path: spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/1/value
  kind: Deployment
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

in params.yaml?

		Trying to figure out how v0.6 and master got out of sync

#298 added on master USERID headers to the deployment

It looks like this didn't include changes to kustomization.yaml to add vars


#302 cherrypicked this onto v0.6-branch
It looks like #274 was the change to master that parameterized a whole bunch of apps by userid

Looks like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/274&gt;#274&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was never added to the v0.6-branch.

		It looks like setting USERID_HEADER and USERID_PREFIX environment variables to the empty string disable identity awareness; it doesn't fall back to GCP config.
Here is where the values get ovewritten by environment variables



kubeflow/components/centraldashboard/app/server.ts


         Line 31
      in
      06b4cb4






 } = process.env; 





And here is where the code ignores things if its the empty string.



kubeflow/components/centraldashboard/app/attach_user_middleware.ts


         Line 12
      in
      06b4cb4






 if (userIdHeader &amp;&amp; req.header(userIdHeader)) { 





So the solution is to override the USERID_HEADER and PREFIX values in kfctl_gcp_iap.0.6.2.yaml

		I tested &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/399&gt;#399&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with IAP see &lt;denchmark-link:http://bit.ly/2ZgOE1v&gt;http://bit.ly/2ZgOE1v&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and that appears to address the problem.

		I tested &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3994&gt;#3994&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with IAP and that appeared to fix the problems with anonymous user and IAP.
