	<summary>Issues with executor image and executor runtime - Kubeflow 0.5 on OCP 3.11</summary>
	<description>
We are trying some simple Argo based experiments like - Hello World and DAG. We have configured the workflow controller config map to use executor image as Argo 2.7.0 and executor runtime as k8sapi. While running the workflow yaml we see that executor image got changed to 2.7.1 and sometime executor runtime gets changed to docker. This happens randomly and we do not find a good reasoning behind this behavior. Can someone explain?
Also, how can we upgrade workflow controller to v 2.7.4? In kubeflow we have 2.2.0

 Hi, did you get this resolved.   Do you need to run on Kubeflow 0.5.   I think you will get more consideration if you could run on Kubeflow 1.x

 Is this still a valid issue or should we close this ?

		Hi Josh - I was still not able to run workflows in Kubeflow 0.5 on OCP
3.11. Will it run on OCP 4.3? Do you have any reference document to run
workflow on 4.3?

Thanks,
Soumo
