	<summary>Istio components are not getting installed on a private GKE cluster</summary>

/kind bug
I'm trying to install Istio on a private GKE cluster. I have downloaded the version 1.4.3 of Istio and then applied the default profile. But not all the components are getting installed from the manifest. Below are the error logs.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ istioctl manifest apply

This will install the default Istio profile into the cluster. Proceed? (y/N) y

Component Pilot - manifest apply returned the following errors:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also, the ingress gateway is not getting created from any of the sample applications (helloworld, bookinfo). Below is the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml

Error from server (Timeout): error when creating "samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml": Timeout: request did not complete within requested timeout 30s
Error from server (Timeout): error when creating "samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml": Timeout: request did not complete within requested timeout 30s

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, I tried to use istio along with GKE on the same private cluster by following the guide &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/installing#creating_a_cluster_with_istio_on_gke&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This worked and all the components are installed successfully, along with the ingress gateway.
I have enabled the ports 80,8080,1000-2000,22,443,9443 on the network as well.
Can please someone tell us what would be the issue causing this error.
