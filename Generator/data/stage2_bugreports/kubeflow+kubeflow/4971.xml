	<summary>katib-mysql startup brittle</summary>
	<description>
There are several issues around katib-mysql failing to start. e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/1049&gt;#1049&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/1156&gt;#1156&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4541&gt;#4541&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and more.
Common pattern seems to be, that the init procedures for mysql doesn't succeed and therefore tables are missing or similar effect. Workarounds involve fiddeling with the storage (changeing to an ssd drive, using a different PV,...) or probes. Myself I got it working by removing the livenessprobe and increasing the initial delay of the readynessprobe to 60s. I run kubeflow on a rather slow machine with rather slow disks (4core i3, 12GB KVM). There obviously seems to be something brittle about the startup procedure of katib-mysql. Probably for slower systems, the init procedures cant complete before the pod is killed due to failing probes.
