	<summary>microk8s enable mongo-db address</summary>

/kind bug
I was hoping someone can kindly help me answer a problem I am having when running the command microk8s.enable kubeflow. The process gets stuck that the step "Deploying Kubeflow" and if you look at the pods, one of the controllers is crashing.
NAMESPACE         NAME                                                  READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
controller-uk8s   pod/controller-0                                      1/2     CrashLoopBackOff   4          3m12s
So if we open up the logs its the controller-0 mondodb pod, and it looks like the issue is the --ipv6 flag. I have no idea how to disable ipv6 because as far as I know the wrapper handles it. Can I pass a config option when running microk8s.enable kubeflow which would force it to not use ipv6 for the mongo container, or resolve the issue some other way?
user:/# microk8s.kubectl logs -n controller-uk8s -p pod/controller-0 mongodb
