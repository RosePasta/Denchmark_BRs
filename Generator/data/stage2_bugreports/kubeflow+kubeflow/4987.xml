	<summary>OAuth Authorized redirect URIs</summary>
	<description>
When I try to edit newly created OAuth credential and click the pencil icon. I go to Authorized redirect URIs box and update it with link in document with my client id and press return key, I do not see  the URI  as confirmed item under Authorized redirect URIs. (The URI should no longer be editable.) URI is still in editable phase. Hence I sm not able to redirect to  Kubeflow dashboard once my project link is created

 I'm confused about where all of this happens.

When I try to edit newly created OAuth credential and click the pencil icon. I go to Authorized redirect URIs box and update it with link in document with my client id and press return key, I do not see the URI as confirmed item under Authorized redirect URIs.

This doesn't sound like a Kubeflow UI, so it seems that some context is missing.
Could you provide more information/context about what you are trying to do and what is failing?
