/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I created a brand new VM, on GCP, with an Ubuntu 18 image. I was following the 0.7 docs to install Kubeflow on GCP from a CLI, except subbing in 1.0 RC equivalents.  The build appears to have worked (generates files), but the apply step...
kfctl apply -V -f kfctl_gcp_iap.v1.0.0.yaml
...failed with the following output:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
The apply command to setup a cluster and install kubeflow.
Anything else you would like to add:

I'm relatively new to GCP, Kubernetes and Kubeflow, this could easily be user error.
I got 0.7.0 to install in December, and a 0.7.1 release to install in early January using similar steps.
I deleted a 0.7.1 installation in the GCP project, from the GKE UI with the same name.  Is there something I would have to manually decommission/remove?
I tried a 0.7.1 install multiple times and had other issues which made me try this.  If somebody knows of a combination of a tagged kfctl release, and a sha for a gcp iap yaml file that works for 0.7.0/1/2 for mac (or worse case linux), that'd be sufficient to get me going.

Environment:

Kubeflow version: v1.0.0
kfctl version: v1.0-rc2
Kubernetes platform: GKE
Kubernetes version: 0.14.8 GKE 33
OS: Ubuntu 18.0.4.3 LTS

		I think I figured out the issue.  I'm just going to do a fresh end-to-end cycle, and report back.

		fwiw, I'm 80% sure a precarious/manual deletion of the GKE cluster combined with manual changes in the GCP project over the prior installation's lifecycle led the above error upon installation.
The solution, was to completely remove the "deployment" from GCP's deployment manager.
Fwiw, in the off chance the info below helps the project, my end-to-end test worked on a mac with the following:

https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v1.0-branch/kfdef/kfctl_gcp_iap.v1.0.0.yaml as of SHA d194a96
https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/v1.0-rc.2 ga3d07b4 tagged against SHA a3d07b4
