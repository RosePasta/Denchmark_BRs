	<summary>Errors installing Kubeflow on an existing K8S/Istio cluster</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I have an existing Kubernetes cluster (1.14) with Istio (1.3.3), Knative and a few other applications running in it. I followed the instructions for installing Kubeflow for my situation.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ wget https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases/download/v0.7.0/kfctl_v0.7.0_linux.tar.gz
$ tar xzf kfctl_v0.7.0_linux.tar.gz
$ mv kfctl ~/.local/bin/
$ export KF_NAME=kubeflow
$ export BASE_DIR=/home/ken.rider/.cache
$ export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/manifests/v0.7-branch/kfdef/kfctl_k8s_istio.0.7.0.yaml
$ cp kfctl_k8s_istio.0.7.0.yaml kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.yaml
$ vi kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.yaml
$ mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
$ cd ${KF_DIR}
$ kfctl apply -V -f ~/kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.yaml
$ kubectl get all -n kubeflow
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I see several errors/warnings in the output where kubeflow is attempting to make changes to resources in another namespace (knative-serving in all the ones I see) that it shouldn't be impacting.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
kubeflow installed without errors.
AND, not make changes to resources already deployed for other applications.

I didn't capture all of the output but what I did is attached as kfctl_apply.log.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/files/3810684/kfctl_apply.log&gt;kfctl_apply.log&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I've also attached the kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.yaml (with a .txt extension) I used with the apply.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/files/3810688/kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.txt&gt;kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 thanks for reporting this.
I have a few questions:

Could you also please mention your installed Knative version?
Could you try installing by removing knative-crds and knative-install applications in the KfDef spec you've shared? I think your K8s cluster already has them installed and we shouldn't need to re-install them through KfDef again.

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/animeshsingh&gt;@animeshsingh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in case this is relevant to how we install or need to upgrade knative.

v0.10.0

I've commented them out of the spec. I'll try it again as soon as the previous kubeflow namespace has been deleted. It's had a terminating status for about 30 minutes now which seems like an extremely long time to delete a namespace. I'll update the issue when I have a chance to try the apply again.

		Attempting to delete the namespace, via kfctl delete -V -f ~/kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.yaml and kubectl delete ns kubeflow, has left the cluster in a bad state.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kubectl get ns
NAME                 STATUS        AGE
default              Active        2d15h
istio-system         Active        2d15h
knative-eventing     Active        2d14h
knative-monitoring   Active        2d14h
knative-serving      Active        2d14h
kube-node-lease      Active        2d15h
kube-public          Active        2d15h
kube-system          Active        2d15h
kubeflow             Terminating   45h
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm using &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52369247/namespace-stuck-as-terminating-how-do-i-remove-it&gt;Namespace “stuck” as Terminating, How do I remove it?&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kubectl api-resources
error: unable to retrieve the complete list of server APIs: custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: the server is currently unable to handle the request
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kubectl get apiservice | grep False
v1beta1.custom.metrics.k8s.io               knative-serving/autoscaler   False (MissingEndpoints)   2d15h
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I may end up having to delete the cluster and start over if I can't figure out what's been screwed up.

		I took the approach above to delete the namespace that was stuck terminating.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(
NAMESPACE=kubeflow
kubectl proxy &amp;
kubectl get namespace $NAMESPACE -o json |jq '.spec = {"finalizers":[]}' &gt;temp.json
curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT --data-binary @temp.json 127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/finalize
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I applied the updated KfDef spec (without the knative-crds and knative-install applications I just commented out and the Istio ones I'd previously commented out). It appears to have been successful.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ kfctl apply -V -f ~/kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.yaml
INFO[0000] No name specified in KfDef.Metadata.Name; defaulting to ken.rider based on location of config file: /home/ken.rider/kfctl_k8s.0.7.0.yaml.  filename="coordinator/coordinator.go:202"
INFO[0000]
.

.
application.app.k8s.io/seldon-core-operator created
INFO[0068] Applied the configuration Successfully!       filename="cmd/apply.go:72"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'll play around with it to see if it's really working then I'll delete the cluster and create a new one to see if it works on a "clean" system.

, sorry. I forgot to update this issue. I did successfully install Kubeflow on a new, clean system, i.e. new K8S install, new Istio install and new Knative install. I followed that with a Kubeflow 0.7.0 install without the Knative and Istio applications.

 should we close this issue then?

		<comment id='12' author='CapKenR' date='2019-12-11T15:50:24Z'>
		I would suggest updating the documentation to reflect the need to comment out the Knative applications if you already have Knative installed.
