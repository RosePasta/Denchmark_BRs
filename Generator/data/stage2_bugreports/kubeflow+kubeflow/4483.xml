	<summary>Problems deploying Kubeflow on GCP  -- Please set the type prefix to be "serviceAccount:"., badRequest"</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug

Previously I had no problems deploying kubeflow following the tutorial for CLI on GCP,&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/&gt;https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/gke/deploy/deploy-cli/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  But currently when redeploying within a new project I am experiencing some strange problems with:
"(kubeflow.error): Code 500 with message: coordinator Apply failed for gcp:  (kubeflow.error): Code 400 with message: gcp apply could not update deployment manager Error Set New IamPolicy error: googleapi: Error 400: Account &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:iotpubsub-1536350750202@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&gt;iotpubsub-1536350750202@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is of type "serviceAccount". Please set the type prefix to be "serviceAccount:"., badRequest"
What did you expect to happen:
Expected the deployment to succeed.
Anything else you would like to add:
Been successful deploying kubeflow previously without any problems :)
Environment:

Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
kfctl version: (use kfctl version): 0.7.0
Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube): GKE
Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): 1.14
OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): Mac

 could you please run
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;gcloud projects get-iam-policy ${PROJECT}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and look for iotpubsub-1536350750202@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
If you feel comfortable please upload the output here?
This isn't a service account that Kubeflow is creating. Kubeflow does a Read-Modify-Write for the IAM policy.
My conjecture is that somehow the iam policy on the project already has that account listed without the prefix serviceAccount. So Kubeflow ends up trying to write it back to the project and that ends up generating the error.

		Apparently I had issus with the authentication to GCP. When running the command
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;gcloud projects get-iam-policy ${PROJECT}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

,it turned out that I had to rerun:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;gcloud auth login
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then everything worked fine!
Thank you for you help &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi&gt;@jlewi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I really appreciate it!
