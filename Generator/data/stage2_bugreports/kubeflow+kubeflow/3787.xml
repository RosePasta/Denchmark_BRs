	<summary>Can't generate CHANGELOG.md for releases</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I tried to generate new change logs for v0.6 releases by running scripts/update-changelog.sh with my personal Github token, but the script failed with errors
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;RETRY - Octokit::AbuseDetected: 'GET https://api.github.com/repos/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/2022/events?per_page=100: 403 - You have triggered an abuse detection mechanism. Please wait a few minutes before you try again. // See: https://developer.github.com/v3/#abuse-rate-limits'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Tried to use --since-tag flag to reduce the traffic, but still hit the rate limit of Github.
Seems related to
