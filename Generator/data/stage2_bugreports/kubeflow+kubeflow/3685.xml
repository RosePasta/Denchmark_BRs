	<summary>kustomize.go delete doesn't check that its pointing to the correct cluster</summary>
	<description>
kustomize.go delete will use the current kubernetes client



kubeflow/bootstrap/v2/pkg/kfapp/kustomize/kustomize.go


         Line 463
      in
      d0c11dd






 if err := kustomize.initK8sClients(); err != nil { 





This means that if the current context isn't pointing at the cluster corresponding to the ${KFAPP} directory they are running kfctl in they will delete the wrong cluster.
kfctl should at a minimum check its k8s client is pointing at the right cluster and if not throw an error.

 Any thought how we should handle this?
Do we need to persist information about what cluster Kubeflow is deployed to in KFDef.Spec or KFDef.Status so that we can check that we are pointing at the correct cluster?

		Currently, since we are not persisting the cluster context in the KfDef.
Having a kubeContext field might be helpful for this.
Skaffold does something similar wherein you have a  field in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/blob/master/pkg/skaffold/config/options.go#L57&gt;config&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can see the &lt;denchmark-link:https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/&gt;Skaffold YAML Spec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 here, all the way in the bottom.
WDYT?
