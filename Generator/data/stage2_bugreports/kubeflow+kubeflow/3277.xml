	<summary>basic-auth: kflogin doesn't work with NodePort service</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to make basic-auth work with a NodePort Service.
The reason is because LoadBalancer is not always available in on-prem scenarios.
However, when kflogin posts the credentials to the gatekeeper, it doesn't specify the correct port, which makes NodePort not work.
