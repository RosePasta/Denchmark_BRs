	<summary>Centraldashboard can not load right profile</summary>

/kind bug
What steps did you take and what happened:
I create several profiles and namespaces are created successfully. When I login using one of the user kf11 in this case , I can not see users' namespace. Instead, anonymous namespace is selected as the owner and user's namespace is not in the drop down list.

Trying to understand more details on the frontend logic to debug the issue.
Seems this issue doesn't happen all the time, I didn't see this problem for last few days.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/api/workgroup/exists/
{"hasAuth":true,"user":"anonymous","hasWorkgroup":true}

/api/workgroup/get-all-namespaces
[
  [
    "anonymous",
    "anonymous@kubeflow.org",
    ""
  ],
  [
    "kf10",
    "kf10@amazon.com",
    ""
  ],
  [
    "kf11",
    "kf11@amazon.com",
    ""
  ]
]

/api/workgroup/env-info/
{
  "user": "anonymous@kubeflow.org",
  "platform": {
    "kubeflowVersion": "unknown",
    "provider": "other://",
    "providerName": "other"
  },
  "namespaces": [
    {
      "user": "anonymous@kubeflow.org",
      "namespace": "anonymous",
      "role": "owner"
    }
  ],
  "isClusterAdmin": false
}

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I use identity pools in AWS, I think the only connection is user's email address. Not sure why it links to the wrong user after login.
Here's the example of profile I created.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: Profile
metadata:
  name: kf10
spec:
  owner:
    kind: User
    name: kf10@amazon.com
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What did you expect to happen:
Choose the right user to show on the namespace drop down list.
Anything else you would like to add:
