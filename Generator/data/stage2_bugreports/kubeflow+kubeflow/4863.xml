	<summary>Notebook Images : Change owner to jovyan of /home/jovyan</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
We create the home directory /home/jovyan here



kubeflow/components/tensorflow-notebook-image/Dockerfile


         Line 90
      in
      296bf14






 mkdir -p $HOME 





but we don't change the owner and group to be jovyan and users respectively.
When using the docker image with Kubeflow notebooks that doesn't matter because we end up overwriting /home/jovyan with a volume that will have user and group set correctly.
However it can lead to unexpected behavior when people use the image directly; e.g. as the base image with func_to_container_op.

 I believe this is already fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4867&gt;#4867&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I believe we still need to build updated docker images and then update the configmap on master to use them.

		This might not make it into 1.1 as the continuous builds &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4789&gt;#4789&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is still in the works.
