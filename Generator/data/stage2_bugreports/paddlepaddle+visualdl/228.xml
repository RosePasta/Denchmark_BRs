	<summary>Image Sampling Error</summary>
	<description>
When we set image sampling number to be 10 but only generate 5 images, it would throw an error. Once the total image amount is less than the sample amount, we should use the total amount or at least prompt a warning to inform the user.

		We use the same sampling strategy on Image data as TensorBoard to fix this bug.
