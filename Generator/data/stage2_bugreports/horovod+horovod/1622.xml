	<summary>Keras shape error when utilising multiple devices</summary>
	<description>
Environment:

Framework: Keras
Framework version: 2.2.5
Horovod version: 0.18.2
MPI version: 3.1.4
CUDA version: 10.1
NCCL version:
Python version: 3.6
OS and version:
GCC version:

Bug report:
When running Horovod with multiple devices with the Yolov3 model, I get the error expected input_2 to have shape (15, 20, 3, 54) but got array with shape (3, 4, 3, 54) on all processes except the main process (rank 0). When running horovod on a single device, I am able to train the model.
Additional details: I am running using  using singularity containers as is documented here (&lt;denchmark-link:https://devblogs.nvidia.com/how-to-run-ngc-deep-learning-containers-with-singularity/&gt;https://devblogs.nvidia.com/how-to-run-ngc-deep-learning-containers-with-singularity/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Sorry, I've realised it has something to do with my code and the way that rank is used.
