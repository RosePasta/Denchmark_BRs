Environment:

Framework: Pytorch
Framework version: 1.4.0+cu100
Horovod version: 0.19.2
MPI version:
CUDA version: cu100
NCCL version:
Python version: 3.6
OS and version: ubuntu 18
GCC version: 7


I train a simple CNN model with MNIST data in k8s cluster. and my k8s info as follows:
total nodes: 3, 2 for GPU node and 1 for CPU node
and GPU nodes each have 8 gpu.
when i create a mpijob, run command like:

and i open the generated timeline.json with chrome://tracing, the picture is:

and i execute ```nvidia-smi`` in each GPU node, i found there only 13 processes running, and i don't know where are the other 3 processes?
And i also found because the process will download the MNIST data from network, and i print the log, there are only 13 processes have download MNIST successã€‚
And the container logs as follows:
