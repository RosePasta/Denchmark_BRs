		The rootcause of this issue is because the pip release of MXNet is built using GCC 4.8.4 and Horovod pip release is built using GCC 5.x. There is a function call from Horovod to MXNet using  which has different function signature between &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/gcc-4_8_4-release/libstdc++-v3/include/std/functional#L2069&gt;GCC 4.x&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/gcc-5_4_0-release/libstdc++-v3/include/std/functional#L1854&gt;GCC 5.x&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
A similar issue was disovered in Tensorflow: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/13308#issuecomment-450202176&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#13308 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We are working to resolve this incompatibility. In the meanwhile, please build MXNet from source following this &lt;denchmark-link:https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/install/build_from_source.html&gt;guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to workaround the segmentation fault. Sorry for the inconvenience!

		The fixes have been merged into MXNet and Horovod. Users can now use MXNet nightly build and Horovod master branch to avoid the GCC incompatibility issue.
