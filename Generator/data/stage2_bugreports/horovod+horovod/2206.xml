	<summary>horovodrun autotune does not log the parameters explored</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to get myself familiar with the autotune feature provided in horovodrun, however, the option --autotune --autotune-log-file log.cvs did not return what I expected. In log.csv, there is only one head line hierarchical_allreduce,hierarchical_allgather,cache_enabled,cycle_time_ms,tensor_fusion_threshold,score. I tried increasing training steps from 100 to 200, still got the same log file. Am I supposed to get a log file with all the parameters explored in performance tuning?

		I tried 1000 steps, and saw some parameters output.
