	<summary>TensorFlow master branch (tf-nightly) compatibility</summary>

See: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35138&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#35138&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In TensorFlow 2.1, experimental_run_tf_function was removed from tf.keras.Model.compile at this commit: c73c99c#diff-de9b96ac2d81503324cbbbe21732031fR1159
In Horovod, this flag / graph mode is necessary in order for Optimizer.get_gradients() to be called, which aggregates gradients across workers. Since this flag has been removed, distributed training in Horovod with tf.keras isn't working in the example scripts for TensorFlow 2.1.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abditag2&gt;@abditag2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is currently investigating a workaround.  Note that we cannot perform the allreduce aggregation in apply_gradients due to interactions with gradient clipping and loss scaling (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/pull/1347&gt;#1347&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		To be clear, TF 2.1.0 release works fine because the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c73c99ca3e0bacf2bca313f270bb3eae28869530&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow@c73c99c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 commit is not included in it. It is currently in , so the next release of TF will have the issue.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nvcastet&gt;@nvcastet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, good catch.  I'll update the issue.

		we have a temporary fix for this in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/pull/1692&gt;#1692&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, we are working with TF team to come up with a better solution here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36398&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#36398&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I will meet the same error when use TF2.1 and horovod 0.19.0.
I am not use the 2.1 release BTW.

  Yes, I set .
Downgrade the TF t0 2.0 fix this problem.
