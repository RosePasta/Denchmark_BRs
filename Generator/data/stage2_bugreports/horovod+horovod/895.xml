Bug report:
Please describe errorneous behavior you're observing and steps to reproduce it.
If the shape of a parameter has to be inferred after a batch of data is seen, the parameter will not be broadcast. Therefore, the correctness of the program depends on whether all workers are initialized with the same random seed. So the following program will not work:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;random.seed(hvd.local_rank())
data = ..
model = mx.gluon.nn.Dense(10)
model.initialize()

// no parameters are broadcast, because initialization is deferred.
hvd.broadcast_parameters(model.collect_parameters())

for batch in data:
    // params are initialized after shape is known
    pred = model(batch.data[0])
    ...
...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 append "using Gluon API" in the title to avoid confusion?
