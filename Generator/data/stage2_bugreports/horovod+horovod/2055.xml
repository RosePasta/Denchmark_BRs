	<summary>PyTorch and MXNet unit tests are missing absolute values</summary>
	<description>
Unit tests that compare "actual" and "expected" tensors use a pattern of subtracting one tensor from the other and taking the max values:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;max_difference = actual.data.sub(expected).max()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This difference is then compared against a threshold (for floating point values):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;assert max_difference &lt;= threshold, 'hvd.allreduce produces incorrect results'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, because this value does not take the absolute value, it is possible that all values are negative, and the "max value" reported is also negative, resulting in the test passing when it should fail.
