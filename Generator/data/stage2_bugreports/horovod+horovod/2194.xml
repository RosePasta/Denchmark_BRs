	<summary>horovod docker build file is broken</summary>
	<description>
The docker build fails at multiple points:


With the default latest wheel the code python -c "import wheel.pep425tags as w" fails, so I had to roll back to
pip install wheel==0.34.2


MXNET pip install fails to find the specified version


horovod install inside the docker fails with error:
libcudart.so.10.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
