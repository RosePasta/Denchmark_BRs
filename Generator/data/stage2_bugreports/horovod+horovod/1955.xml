	<summary>Account for dynamic world size when averaging gradients in TensorFlow</summary>
	<description>
Currently, the TensorFlow graph is constructed with the world size embedded as a constant tensor.  When running in elastic mode, this results in problems with averaging as the size is not updated as workers are added / removed.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/pull/357&gt;#357&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 provides an implementation of size ops that account for dynamic world sizes.  We should rebase and merge in this change to fix this.
