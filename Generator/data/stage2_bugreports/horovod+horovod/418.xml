	<summary>Horovod image build failure</summary>
	<description>
When attempting to build the horovod docker image following the steps in docker.md, the build fails due to the following error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The following held packages will be changed:
  libnccl2
The following packages will be DOWNGRADED:
  libnccl-dev libnccl2
E: Packages were downgraded and -y was used without --allow-downgrades.
0 upgraded, 40 newly installed, 2 downgraded, 0 to remove and 13 not upgraded.
The command '/bin/sh -c apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends         build-essential         cmake         git         curl         vim         wget         ca-certificates         libcudnn7=${CUDNN_VERSION}         libnccl2=${NCCL_VERSION}         libnccl-dev=${NCCL_VERSION}         libjpeg-dev         libpng-dev         python${PYTHON_VERSION}         python${PYTHON_VERSION}-dev' returned a non-zero code: 100
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When adding the --allow-downgrades it returns another error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The following held packages will be changed:
  libnccl2
The following packages will be DOWNGRADED:
  libnccl-dev libnccl2
0 upgraded, 40 newly installed, 2 downgraded, 0 to remove and 13 not upgraded.
E: Held packages were changed and -y was used without --allow-change-held-packages.
The command '/bin/sh -c apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends --allow-downgrades         build-essential 	        cmake 		        git 			        curl 				        vim 					        wget 						        ca-certificates 						        libcudnn7=${CUDNN_VERSION} 								        libnccl2=${NCCL_VERSION} 									        libnccl-dev=${NCCL_VERSION} 										        libjpeg-dev 										        libpng-dev 												        python${PYTHON_VERSION}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

it seems it requires --allow-change-held-packages as well but i am not sure if this flag is intended to be used. Is there a new NCCL version that should be used?
