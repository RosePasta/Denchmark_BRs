		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ashiqimranintel&gt;@ashiqimranintel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, TensorFlow made an update to Eigen on master that required us to upgrade.  This has been fixed on master, so please install Horovod from master to use TensorFlow master.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tgaddair&gt;@tgaddair&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, when will you publish the latest master on pypi.org ?

		Since this version of TensorFlow is unreleased, I don't think we should push a hotfix release for this right now.
In the meantime, you can install Horovod from master like so:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[HOROVOD args...] pip install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/horovod/horovod.git@master
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		IMO this just hints at a much larger problem: You are mixing 2 different versions of Eigen: The one TF installed and which gets included via -I&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/include and the one you vendored as a submodule and include too.
Now depending on the file included you get either of (or even mix) those which can lead to ODR violations. Now updating the Eigen submodule to the same version TF uses resolves the problem but only for that combinations of versions. But it makes it unable to use the next Horovod with the currently released TF or any prior version. Even worse: It may work. And fail at some point under almost impossible to track conditions.
Similar reasoning applies to flatbuffers: TF uses flatbuffers itself any may use another version than Horovod includes again causing ODR violations. However this will only manifest at runtime as TF doesn't seem to install the flatbuffer headers.
I'd strongly suggest to search for a TF or system installed version of the vendored libraries before using them. find_path in combination with NO_DEFAULT_PATH can be used for that.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Flamefire&gt;@Flamefire&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I agree with the high level idea, which is something the maintainers have been discussing lately, so thanks for raising the issue.  I've opening &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/issues/2429&gt;#2429&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to track.
