Bug report:
try to pip install Horovod with source build TensorFlow, but an error was reported:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;error: ‘bfloat16’ in namespace ‘Eigen’ does not name a type
   typedef Eigen::bfloat16 bfloat16;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I believe it's caused by missing build dependency for Horovod after TF upgrade the usage of Eigen::bfloat16. Maybe need to fix BUILD file somewhere in Horovod.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Zantares&gt;@Zantares&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this was resolved in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/pull/2184&gt;#2184&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  To workaround, you can install from master, or wait for the upcoming v0.20.0 release, which should hopefully come out later today.

Thanks for the answer, I will use master first.
