	<summary>Docker example fails</summary>
	<description>
Environment:

Framework: Any of frameworks
Framework version:
Horovod version: 0.19.1
MPI version: 3.0.0
CUDA version: 10.0
NCCL version: 2.4.7-1+cuda10.0
Python version: 2.7
OS and version: ubuntu16.04
GCC version: g++-2.8

Bug report:
I build a docker image of the latest horovod sources from Dockerfile.test.gpu with a slight addition to support ssh (took a couple of lines installing OpenSSH-server from Dockerfile.gpu).
Running training on a single node inside a docker container worked perfectly.
Then started 2 containers on separate machines following instructions in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/master/docs/docker.rst#running-on-multiple-machines&gt;documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Passwordless ssh was established.
The issues are two-fold.
The first one looked like a typo &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/master/horovod/run/driver/driver_service.py#L148&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. "Settings doesn't have attribute nic". There must be "nics".
When I fixed it, the second problem came out.
I'm trying to on host1 with following line:

It looks similar to issues &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/issues/975&gt;#975&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/horovod/horovod/issues/971&gt;#971&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Though, the error messages says it can't connect not to remote servers but to localhost:

And following error traceback:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; self.RequestHandlerClass(request, client_address, self)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/SocketServer.py", line 652, in __init__
    self.handle()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/horovod/run/common/util/network.py", line 107, in h$ndle
    req = server._wire.read(self.rfile)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/horovod/run/common/util/network.py", line 80, in re$d
    message_len = struct.unpack('i', rfile.read(4))[0]
error: unpack requires a string argument of length 4
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When I try to run the following way:
 horovodrun -np 4 -H host1:2,host2:2 -p 1234 python pytorch_synthetic_benchmark.py
It fails with following error:
ssh: connect to host host1 port 1234: Connection refused. Though, documentation doesn't state
to run ssh in container starting the training. When I start sshd on host1 the problem described above comes out.
Building docker image not from sources, but using Dockerfile.gpu, everything works fine. So there must be a problem with a current version.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ilmarkov&gt;@ilmarkov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for raising the issue.  It does look like there is indeed a typo following a recent refactor on master.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/abditag2&gt;@abditag2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can you take a look, and add a unit test to ensure we are properly testing this code path?
