	<summary>AssertionError: daemonic processes are not allowed to have children</summary>
	<description>
Environment:

Framework: (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, MXNet) tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
Framework version: tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
Horovod version: 5fa1d7aea2c89fdfa15a688aa413ea49a480ab38
MPI version: N/A
CUDA version: 10.0
NCCL version: tip of master
Python version: 3.6.9
OS and version: Ubuntu 18.04
GCC version: 4.8 (I think that's what gets selected)

Checklist:

Did you search issues to find if somebody asked this question before? yes
If your question is about hang, did you read this doc? N/A
If your question is about docker, did you read this doc? N/A
Did you check if you question is answered in the troubleshooting guide? yes

Bug report:
There appears to be some regression introduced by the commit 5fa1d7aea2c89fdfa15a688aa413ea49a480ab38.  At some point some process is doing something that is apparently not acceptable, and the whole job crashes.  I have no problem with the commit just before it.
I have two GCP ubuntu machines with the configuration above.  Horovod was installed like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git co --recurse-submodules 5fa1d7aea2c89fdfa15a688aa413ea49a480ab38
env \
    HOROVOD_WITHOUT_MPI=1 \
    HOROVOD_WITH_GLOO=1 \
    HOROVOD_WITH_TENSORFLOW=1 \
    HOROVOD_WITHOUT_PYTORCH=1 \
    HOROVOD_WITHOUT_MXNET=1 \
    HOROVOD_GPU_ALLREDUCE=NCCL \
    pip install . -v
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then I ran it like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;horovodrun -np 2 -H localhost:1,rb2:1 --network-interface ens8 --gloo --verbose --verbose python3 learn_horovod.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And here is the full output:
