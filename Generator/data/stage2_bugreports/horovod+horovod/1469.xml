I installed tensorflow 1.15.0 ( shows ) and then installed horovod 0.18.1. After that, I got an undefined symbol error when running tests:  (unmangled). However, I found this version of tensorflow was compiled with the older ABI and only  (non cxx11) exists. And I have to apply this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hanyucui/horovod/pull/1&gt;patch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to force horovod use the older ABI. I suspect there is a bug in the ABI detection code.
I dug deeper and found tensorflow actually has two definitions for that function built against different ABIs (using the nm command):

0000000000cf2b80 T tensorflow::OpKernel::name[abi:cxx11]() const (lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/libtensorflow_framework.so.1)
0000000000c6c100 T tensorflow::OpKernel::name() const (lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/libtensorflow_framework.so.1)

I suspect Horovod is trying to load the one in tensorflow_core/, which uses the old (pre-C++11) ABI.

		OK, false alarm. There is something wrong with my tensorflow installation.
