		Logs suggest that the issue was with 20190905 nightly build, but it seems that they pulled it since now the latest is 20190903. I reran the test and it worked.

		Looks like 20190906 also has an issue though, this time another set of objects is missing.  I've raised &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32293&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#32293&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
