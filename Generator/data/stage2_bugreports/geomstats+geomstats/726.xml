	<summary>Geodesic method is not vectorized</summary>
	<description>
The following code does not run (where self.space=Hypersphere(4)):
n_geodesic_points = 10
initial_point = self.space.random_uniform(2)
vector = gs.array([[2., 0., -1., -2., 1.]] * 2)
initial_tangent_vec = self.space.to_tangent(
    vector=vector, base_point=initial_point)
geodesic = self.metric.geodesic(
    initial_point=initial_point,
    initial_tangent_vec=initial_tangent_vec)

t = gs.linspace(start=0., stop=1., num=n_geodesic_points)
points = geodesic(t)
In fact it won't be possible to fully vectorize the path method of geodesics, because it would require exp and log method to take input of shapes [n_times, n_samples, {dim [n,n]}], so there is an extra dimension we are not ready to deal with. We can either

update the doc to mention it's not vectorized
call path separately for each sample with a for loop.
