		Testing this with a 1.9 gb file and it appears to have been fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepforge-dev/deepforge/pull/861&gt;#861&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (I believe it was fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/webgme/webgme/commit/bd0369aba4a2810153f8fbf63e503bd1b4811fd9&gt;webgme/webgme@bd0369a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
