	<summary>Pipeline not starting on SciServer Compute</summary>
	<description>
It appears that for some users (such as kmoore), running a pipeline on SciServer Compute hangs indefinitely. Looking at the server logs shows:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-08-06T16:59:31.823Z - error: [gme:server:worker:simpleworker:pid_514591:WorkerFunctions:PluginManagerBase:plugin:ExecutePipeline] Could not execute "GetCifar10Data": Error: SciServer Files request failed: Error in job definition
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As this appears to be specific to this user, I suspect the error is happening on the SciServer side. However, this should be handled better by deepforge so we don't need to go to the server logs.

		The issue seems to be that the sciserver docker image DeepForge is accessible to some users while not for other users. So, I would recharacterize this issue not to be a code related bug in deepforge but rather an issue with sciserver's docker image for deepforge access to every account.

		Thanks, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/umesh-timalsina&gt;@umesh-timalsina&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for finding the source of the issue. I am going to leave this issue since the error is not handled properly in deepforge. (The pipeline should show the error when an error occurs during job creation.)
