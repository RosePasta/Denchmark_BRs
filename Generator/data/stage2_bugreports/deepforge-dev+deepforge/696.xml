	<summary>Output toggler overlaps xlua progress bar</summary>
	<description>
when using an xlua progress bar, the output toggler overlaps the text making it so you can't read the progress bar.
An easy fix would be to add extra space at the bottom of the log viewer so the user can scroll the last couple lines past the bottom of the terminal window.
