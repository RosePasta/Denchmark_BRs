	<summary>multiple library update queries</summary>
	<description>
If someone has updated their seeds then the seeds are updated again, the new clients will be uploading to the old version of the library still (it updates to the hash from the old library).
The hash.txt file should also contain the version info so it can be detected when it is out-of-date
