		Can you check out the branch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dfst/deepforge/tree/660-job-not-starting&gt;660-job-not-starting&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? If you can replicate this issue on that branch, it should give a better idea of what is causing the error.
If you can't replicate it, I will probably merge that branch so that when it happens again, we can get a better idea of the cause...
