	<summary>Cannot read property 'title' of undefined (PlotlyDescExtractor)</summary>
	<description>
There is currently an error thrown by the plot visualizer that occurs when restarting an individual job:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4982789/75995147-9df50100-5ec1-11ea-9eb2-0b1668054ea2.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Even if there is something happening incorrectly in the restart logic, this should fail gracefully and not throw an exception...

		For this to work correctly, the else block should only be executed if and only if desc has a subPlot.
