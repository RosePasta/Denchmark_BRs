	<summary>Data upload fails when connecting Input-&amp;gt;Output w/ different storage backends</summary>
	<description>
Currently, the Output operation expects the incoming data to already exist on the target storage backend. This is not the case when an Input has data on a different storage backend and is connected directly to an Output operation.
