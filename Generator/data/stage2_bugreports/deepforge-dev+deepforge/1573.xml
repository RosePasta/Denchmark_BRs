	<summary>Unexpected end of JSON input for metadata info</summary>
	<description>
When parsing graph/image metadata JSON from the worker, sometimes we can get JSON parsing errors - especially when sending large JSON objects.
It appears that this is due to trying to parse partial lines from the stdout received from the worker.
