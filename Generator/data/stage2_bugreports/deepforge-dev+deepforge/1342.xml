	<summary>Running Execution Deletion throws error in the server</summary>
	<description>
As of right now,

User initiates execution deletion (sending "abort" message to plugin)
Plugin receives abort and sends "cancel" to the running jobs
Execution is deleted
Plugin save completes and it updates the node references in memory. Since some of the nodes have been deleted, they are replaced with null
Plugin receives status update that running job has been canceled and tries to update the node. However, as the node was deleted it results in an error.

To recreate the issue, you would need to (and this should be done in a test):

Call onAbort
Delete job nodes (or the entire execution)
Call save (wait until complete)
Respond with end messages from the compute backend
