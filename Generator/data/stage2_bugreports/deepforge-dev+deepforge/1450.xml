	<summary>Bad formatting for subfigure titles</summary>
	<description>
When creating multiple subfigures (with titles), the title can overlap the label for the x-axis as shown below:

		Upon closer inspection, it also appears that the titles are not placed in the same position above each subfigure. In the left column, the titles are further to the right than in the right column...

		This could be resolved by using the property  of the  x and y axis. Though, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/2746&gt;plotly/plotly.js#2746&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has a pretty solid discussion on why this will be a challenge to generate a dynamic subplot title without bad formats. A thorough look should be given to plotly.py and how it implements subplots title.

		I think we are better off by adding plot number (a.), (b.), (c.)... and adding a text area at the end with all the subplots title.
