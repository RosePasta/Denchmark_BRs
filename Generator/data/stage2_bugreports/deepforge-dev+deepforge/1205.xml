	<summary>"Metadata about result types not found." when process exits involuntarily</summary>
	<description>
The spawned process for the job can exit involuntarily (at least in WSL) resulting in a null exit code. This can result in the process appearing successful to the monitoring script (start.js).
The monitoring script should be robust to processes which exit involuntarily.
