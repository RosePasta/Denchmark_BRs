	<summary>Invalid reference options are being loaded after adding deepforge-keras</summary>
	<description>
The valid references for operations are determined based on nodes that have code generation plugins (and adhere to the convention of naming these plugins as "Generate_____"). Since we have libraries available in the deployment, we should be able to filter using the nodeTypes provided by the supported libraries in the deployment.
If the library is not supported by the deployment, it will not be able to execute the pipeline anyway (since the code generation plugin will not be available).
