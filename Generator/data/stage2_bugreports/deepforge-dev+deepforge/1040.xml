	<summary>Code edits don't update the operation interface editor</summary>
	<description>
The operation parsers should always return an array when getting the attributes. Currently, this is causing a bug when the method doesn't exist and the operation interface is not updated.
This is a bug in the v2.0.0 branch and is not an issue in v1.x
