		There are three cases where this can be a problem:

Two lines w/ the same name in one graph
Two graphs using the same line names shown in the execution index
Two graphs for the same execution w/ colliding names of lines

I think they should be handled as follows:

lines w/ the same name in a single deepforge.Graph should simply add (2), (3), etc

based on some arbitrary tie breaking rule (say the sorting of the relids)


lines colliding between graphs of different executions

add (&lt;execId&gt;) where the &lt;execId&gt; is also shown in the ExecIndex
this should probably be done for all the lines regardless of collisions
should probably be an abbreviation rather than simply a count

this will allow them to be distinguishable from the earlier bullet (in case both cases happen at once)




lines colliding between graphs of same execution in ExecIndex

handled the same as the first bullet

		For now, I am just going to address the second bullet point.  The first bullet point is easy to modify from the user's point of view (just given the lines on a single graph unique names!)
It could come up later as a feature to add but as the second bullet point is the most relevant and the others are quite minor, I will simply solve the second point for now.
