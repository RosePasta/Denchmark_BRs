	<summary>Conda worker environment not activated if no job dependencies specified</summary>
	<description>
Currently, the job will create the deepforge worker/ job conda environment if it doesn't exist and it will use it correctly. However, if the deepforge worker environment exists already and there are no job dependencies, it will not activate the worker environment.
