	<summary>Blob retrieval console errors when using ArtifactIndex</summary>
	<description>
The Artifact index is not respecting the embedded property passed into it and is subscribing to state updates through WebGMEGlobal.State which results in a race condition when changing nodes. Also, it is not filtering out the current node and is trying to retrieve the (non-existent) data from the blob for it.
