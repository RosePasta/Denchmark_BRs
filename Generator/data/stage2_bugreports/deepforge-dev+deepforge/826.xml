	<summary>Graph missing points</summary>
	<description>
Graphs can sometimes lose intermediate points.
It looks like this is due to an issue where the point information is querying while applying the changes to nodes in a project (just before saving). We need to introduce another tier of diffs in the plugin which record the currently being applied changes.
