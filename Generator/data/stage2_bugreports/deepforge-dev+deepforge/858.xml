	<summary>Shouldn't open artifacts in artifact index</summary>
	<description>
Currently, users can open artifacts from the artifact index. This will be a nice feature in the future but currently there are no good visualizers for the data in the indices (it just allows users to edit the serializer/deserializer currently) so it should probably be disabled for now
