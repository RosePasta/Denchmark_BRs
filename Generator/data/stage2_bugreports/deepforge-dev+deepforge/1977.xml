	<summary>Multiple Graph nodes are created form same matplotlib figure</summary>
	<description>
It looks like the  backend for matplotlib is sending multiple figure updates even though one should be enough. As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/brollb&gt;@brollb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  suggested, one Idea is to send figure number along with plot's json data. That way we can differentiate the figures and create correct number of  nodes. However, if possible it might be worth it to investigate more and send it only once when its necessary.

		The issue was not with plotly backend but with metadata parsing.
