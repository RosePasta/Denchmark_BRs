	<summary>Deleting execution should remove the associated tag</summary>
	<description>
This is somewhat minor but can be annoying when looking at the project history and seeing tags for executions that no longer exist. This also results in the name not being reused (as the execution name must be unique w/ respect to the tags and the current existing executions)
