	<summary>Cannot merge forks of running jobs that update frequently</summary>
	<description>
When running two training tasks (2 separate architectures). The branches will not merge because the status bar is committing while the merge is attempted.

		As of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepforge-dev/deepforge/issues/785&gt;#785&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the stdout should not be committed to the project so the status bar should not cause issues w/ merging
This could still be an issue if you are the branches are doing something like updating a graph (deepforge.Graph) every second but I suspect this scenario is much less likely.
Thoughts?
