	<summary>Lines (in plots) are not always resolved correctly</summary>
	<description>
Lines in plots can be duplicated (as they are not resolved correctly). This can result in apparent missing points as an incomplete, earlier line is plotted rather than the most recent.

		I believe this has been fixed as of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepforge-dev/deepforge/commit/ee75184c40589368cf6cb734eb6740648b148e21&gt;ee75184&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (I suspect the fix was added in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepforge-dev/deepforge/pull/1459&gt;#1459&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
