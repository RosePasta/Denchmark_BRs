	<summary>"Download" button broken for artifacts</summary>
	<description>
This is a pretty minor issue since artifacts cannot be opened currently. However, with the introduction of interactive editing capabilities, this will likely return so this should be fixed.
Essentially, this just needs to be updated to use the storage adapters.
