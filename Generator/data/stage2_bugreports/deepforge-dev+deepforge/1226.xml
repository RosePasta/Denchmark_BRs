	<summary>Cached nodes not updated on SYNCED save result</summary>
	<description>
This is a subtle bug that I suspect was introduced by a subtle change in behavior upon updating webgme. Essentially, cached nodes are only updated if the save result is MERGED when they should also be updated on SYNCED.
The bug is definitely in this code base but I suspect previous versions of webgme were returning MERGED more frequently so this wasn't a problem.
