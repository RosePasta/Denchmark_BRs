	<summary>Creating a new Criterion should default to nn.Criterion</summary>
	<description>
Currently any new layer or criterion defaults to nn.Module and a criterion should default to nn.Criterion .

		Additionally, how do you pass arguments to criterions?

		Unfortunately there isn't a good way right now if you are using them as simply a criterion reference. You should be able to put them in an architecture for the time being and reference the arch as a work around (though it is not ideal)

		I don't think that will work, unfortunately. Mainly because an architecture takes 1 argument and a criterion takes 2 on forward prop. Right now I'm just defining it locally.

		good point. yeah, then you will just have to use it in the op for now :/ not ideal but should be effective for now.
Custom layers (including criterion) are available in the operation code so there shouldn't be any problems there (I think I mentioned that a while ago but figured it would be good to mention it here for future reference, etc)
