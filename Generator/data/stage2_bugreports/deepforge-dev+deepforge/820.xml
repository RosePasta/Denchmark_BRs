	<summary>Worker continues to run execution when cancel pressed</summary>
	<description>
The worker continued to run an execution after it was cancelled. Not entirely sure how to replicate this but suspicions is I hit the cancel button before the execution started!

		I'm having this issue as well.
Additionally, I often lose the connection between the worker feedback and the server (this might already be an issue). I can view the worker log and see that it is still running.

		Looks like the same as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepforge-dev/deepforge/issues/783&gt;#783&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Did you cancel the pipeline execution or the job? I was just able to replicate the quickly canceling the pipeline execution after starting it. I was still able to cancel the job by opening it and canceling it from there.
It that is the same problem you had, canceling the job might be a temporary workaround until I straighten out the main issue.
