	<summary>census/tf-keras training tensorflow2</summary>
	<description>

The tutorial &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/getting-started-keras&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 works correctly for the following command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;gcloud ai-platform local train \
  --package-path trainer \
  --module-name trainer.task \
  --job-dir local-training-output
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Model training occurs and epochs are shown in the console.
However, I need this pipeline to work in tensorflow2. When I change &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/blob/master/census/tf-keras/requirements.txt&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to tensorflow 2.1.0 and re-install, I get the following output for the gcloud command above
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&lt;subprocess.Popen object at 0x106cdb650&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Nothing else appears in the console and no training occurs.
Describe the solution you'd like
A (probably small) code change to make this tutorial work correctly for tensorflow 2
