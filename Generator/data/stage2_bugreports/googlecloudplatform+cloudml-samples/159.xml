	<summary>Reddit_tft example_id does not appear in prediction outputs from cloud ml</summary>
	<description>
I can see in the reddit_tft example &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/blob/c84c39c0fcd9889718e1b00ef10fdb699ec4b6f0/reddit_tft/trainer/task.py#L36&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that there seems to be scope for an  built into the code. However it does not seem to be being used, is not pulled into the prediction data and hence not served up with predictions in batch or online.
There is an id field in the source BQ reddit tables that could fairly easily be added to the beam preprocessing.
Then it would just be a matter of adding the key to the serving outputs or whatever way makes most sense to get the key back with predictions when running via cloud ml.
This is a little bit similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/issues/67&gt;this issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but i think it merits a seperate issue as the census example is a bit different than the reddit one in being csv files vs beam+tf records.
So adding a key to the reddit example as part of this issue would give a tfrecords based approach to adding a key, which seems to me to be a little different to the census example in being set up a bit different and having slightly different serving function approaches.

 Thanks for reporting the issue.  I plan to update the reddit_tft to be compatible with tf 1.4 soon, and might be able to incorporate some changes as you suggested.
On the other hand, if you already have a proposed implementation, please feel free to create a PR!

 Cool - that would really really be useful...i'm twisting and turning trying to figure it out myself but failing.
My attempt is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andrewm4894/my-google-cloudml-tensorflow-examples/tree/master/reddit_classifier&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Specifically &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andrewm4894/my-google-cloudml-tensorflow-examples/blob/da10dafe879132befe1336049c8e6745b8de0b80/reddit_classifier/trainer/task.py#L257&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 trying to wrap a custom estimator and use &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/forward_features&gt;forward_features&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as per suggestion from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dawu76&gt;@dawu76&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/issues/67#issuecomment-362117778&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
My related &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48543299/converting-google-cloud-ml-github-reddit-example-from-regression-to-classificati&gt;SO question&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as well.
I don't think it's too far off as it trains for a step or two and then fails with this error (more info &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/issues/67#issuecomment-362260539&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
):
NotFoundError (see above for traceback): /tmp/tmp2jllvb/model.ckpt-1_temp_9530d2c5823d4462be53fa5415e429fd; No such file or directory
[[Node: save/SaveV2 = SaveV2[dtypes=[DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT, DT_INT64], _device="/job:ps/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0"]
Not sure what it even means though - think might be related to me missing something in the estimator spec or something.

 Thank you for all the useful information!  Let me know if you were able to make more progress and how I might be able to help.  Meanwhile I will get started on updating the reddit_tft sample to tf 1.4 soon.

		I'm afraid I'm still stuck on the error i mentioned, no idea how to even debug it :(

		Simplified things a bit for testing - set it to BASIC set up and got more informative error - see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/issues/67#issuecomment-366034596&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		have the bones of an example with key in predictions here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andrewm4894/my-google-cloudml-tensorflow-examples/tree/master/reddit_score&gt;https://github.com/andrewm4894/my-google-cloudml-tensorflow-examples/tree/master/reddit_score&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It does not use tft though (i gave up) and i still need to figure out getting the comments into an embedding feature.

 thanks!
I tried to run the tft preprocessing steps and found that the preprocessing steps went through fine with tensorflow==1.4.0 and tensorflow-transform==0.4.0.  But the actual training failed with NaN loss.

 hmm not sure what that might going on there.
I'm having trouble getting the comments into a bag of words and then embedding.
I made a fresh SO question &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49507676/tensorflow-dataset-how-to-get-my-features&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to show what i mean.

 looks like checkpoint dir path isn't provided. can you confirm?
