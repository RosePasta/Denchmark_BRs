	<summary>No handlers could be found for logger "oauth2client.contrib.multistore_file"</summary>
	<description>
For problems running the sample code please provide the following information.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Mac
TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.2.1
Python version: 2.7.13
Exact command to reproduce: See below
Tensorflow Transform environment (if applicable, see below): 0.1.10

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to run the reddit_tft preprocess.py file and I got the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;No handlers could be found for logger "oauth2client.contrib.multistore_file"
2017-10-07 14:04:08.637282: F tensorflow/core/platform/cloud/http_request.cc:334] Check failed: that-&gt;post_body_read_ &lt;= that-&gt;post_body_buffer_.size() 
Abort trap: 6
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I downloaded the most recent cloudml-samples, unzipped it and switched to the reddit_tft folder. Then I typed in the command instructed on the readme:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python preprocess.py --training_data fh-bigquery.reddit_comments.2015_12 \
                     --eval_data fh-bigquery.reddit_comments.2016_01 \
                     --predict_data fh-bigquery.reddit_comments.2016_02 \
                     --output_dir "${PREPROCESS_OUTPUT}" \
                     --project_id "${PROJECT}" \
                     --cloud
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I recognize that the requirements technically say tensorflow 1.2.0, but I am running this on the cloud and the error does not seem to have anything to do with tensorflow so I don't think the fact that I have 1.2.1 should have an effect.
Any ideas why this sample is not working for me?
