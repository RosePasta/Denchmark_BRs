	<summary>flowers requirements install fails</summary>
	<description>
Cloud Shell
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorflow==1.8.0
tensorflow-tensorboard==0.4.0
apache-beam==0.6.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to follow the tutorial here and run the flowers example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/flowers-tutorial&gt;https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/flowers-tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I do the install requirements step and the tensorflow install step I get these:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;google-cloud-storage 1.10.0 has requirement google-cloud-core&lt;0.29dev,&gt;=0.28.0, but you'll have google-cloud-core 0.22.1 which is incompatible.
google-api-core 1.1.2 has requirement setuptools&gt;=34.0.0, but you'll have setuptools 33.1.1 which is incompatible.
google-cloud-translate 1.3.1 has requirement google-cloud-core&lt;0.29dev,&gt;=0.28.0, but you'll have google-cloud-core 0.22.1 which is incompatible.
google-cloud-logging 1.6.0 has requirement google-cloud-core&lt;0.29dev,&gt;=0.28.0, but you'll have google-cloud-core 0.22.1 which is incompatible.
tensorboard 1.8.0 has requirement protobuf&gt;=3.4.0, but you'll have protobuf 3.2.0 which is incompatible.
tensorflow 1.4.1 has requirement protobuf&gt;=3.3.0, but you'll have protobuf 3.2.0 which is incompatible.
google-cloud-datastore 1.6.0 has requirement google-cloud-core&lt;0.29dev,&gt;=0.28.0, but you'll have google-cloud-core 0.22.1 which is incompatible.
google-cloud-spanner 1.3.0 has requirement google-cloud-core&lt;0.29dev,&gt;=0.28.0, but you'll have google-cloud-core 0.22.1 which is incompatible.
tensorflow-tensorboard 0.4.0 has requirement protobuf&gt;=3.4.0, but you'll have protobuf 3.2.0 which is incompatible.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After various pip cycles I got it down to
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;google-cloud-bigquery 0.22.1 has requirement google-cloud-core&lt;0.23dev,&gt;=0.22.1, but you'll have google-cloud-core 0.28.1 which is incompatible.
apache-beam 0.6.0 has requirement protobuf==3.2.0, but you'll have protobuf 3.5.2.post1 which is incompatible.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi,
Thanks for catching this. Hopefully we can get this resolved, but in the meantime, mind trying this alternative?
I got the same issue too, but was able to get around it by switching
pip &gt;&gt;&gt; pip3
python &gt;&gt; python3
Let me know if that works for you!

		I was able to workaround this issue by setting apache-beam version to 2.5.0 in requirements file. This allowed me to successfully run the sample.sh script with a following list of dependencies
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;apache-beam[gcp]==2.5.0
pillow==4.0.0
tensorflow==1.4.1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Similar as issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/issues/205&gt;#205&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
