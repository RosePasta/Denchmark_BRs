	<summary>Unable to get "OBJECTIVE_VALUE" while performing Hyperparameter Tuning in CloudML</summary>
	<description>
Error explained:
Trying to run hyperparameter tuning in CloudML for the following values: (maxTrials: 25, maxParallelTrials: 5). I can see that status for the tuning is green (successful). But there is no "OBJECTIVE_VALUE" in the Training output. Hence I am unable to find out which trial is the best one to choose.
Bug is related to Hyperparameter Tuning in CloudML.
Observation:
If I change the parameters for YAML file to (maxTrials: 4, maxParallelTrials: 2), I can see the "OBJECTIVE_VALUE" in the Training output.
System Information

python-version 3.5

Query:
Is there any specific combination of parameters which are to be used if perfroming hyperparameter tuning in CLoudML ?

  thanks for helping me out. But I have found the solution to the problem.
Looks like scale-tier is to be changed from BASIC to STANDARD_1 as I increase the number of parallel batches.
Solved.
