trainning coco is ok, but when I use the custom dataset, I met an issue. Could you help me fix it?
thanks a lot

		Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 &amp;&amp; cd yolov3 # clone latest
python3 detect.py  # verify detection
python3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in a GCP Quickstart Guide VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, PyTorch &gt;= 1.4 etc. You can also use our Google Colab Notebook and our Docker Image to test your code in a working environment.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

 Hi Sir
I do not think so. this may be not a solution.  Previous version  was ok, But for the new version, it always happens.
File "/home/jingwei/yolov3/utils/utils.py", line 967, in plot_images
cls = names[cls] if names else cls
IndexError: list index out of range
I just used my custom dataset
If I set epoch as 3, it is ok but if I set it to 10, it is not ok.  something like this. Thanks
I tried several times, when epoch is 10, it is not ok, why?sometimes epoch 10 is ok but sometimes it is not ok.  Did you set anything in the new version.  could you check this?
Less than 10 for epoch is ok,but more than 10 for epoch is not ok.
there is something wrong with your current version. Thanks a lot.

 see the section of code you pasted where it says your code is behind?
Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 18 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
(use "git pull" to update your local branch)
Suggest you follow the recommendation the code is giving you. Before raising any issues you should make sure you are using the latest code.
