I can't see the predict bounding box at all, how can I solve this problem?

		detect.py outputs are saved to /output folder. If images there have no boxes then no objects were detected.
You can use our &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8T-VFxQkjDe4idzN8F-hbIBqkkkQnxw&gt;Google Colab Notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to evaluate detect.py in a working environment.

		Thank you for your reply. I found that the network I trained was able to display the detection box after drastically lowering the confidence threshold. What do you think of this situation? Is it possible that it is caused by too little training data?

 I can't comment on your data since every custom dataset is different. You might try training longer.

Thanks for your suggestions. As shown in the figure, after 100 rounds of training, my training loss and test loss have stabilized. So is it necessary to continue training?

 hmm interesting. Everything seems good, no need to continue training, as your mAP seems to be near 0.99.

 Did you make any progress on this? I am facing the same issue with my custom dataset.
