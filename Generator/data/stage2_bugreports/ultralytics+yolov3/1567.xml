	<summary>The cfg file doesn't work.</summary>

I want to train the network with 1 channel input and 4 classes.
I followedï¼š
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/192&gt;#192&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Here, I modified the classes= 4. and change the filter. But my network still takes 3 channels until I set
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    output_filters = [1]  # input channels
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

in model.py
Seems like the yolov3-spp.cfg does not make a difference for model creation.
If it is not the right way, how can we modify the training scheme to support 1 channel input and 4 classes?
