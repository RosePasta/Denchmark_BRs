	<summary>how to use the GPU using detect.py</summary>
	<description>
hello when i use detect.py it will only says "using cpu"
is it possible to use the gpu instead ? is some parameter or file to change to do so ?
i have read several times the tutorial but can't figure it out
i have installed cudnn and cuda, i am on windows 10, i have gtx 1070
i am currently at 0.8sec per frame for a 2560*1440 video
thanks for answer !

		I ran a detection just now and GPU is correctly recognized, maybe you should check your local environment.

		so it's supposed to run on the gpu automatically if it is available ? or does it need to specified it with some argument??
how else can i check than my installation of cuda is well done ?
if i run
nvcc --version
i get

 your environment is incorrect. All available GPUs are automatically used by default.
Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove exising repo
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 &amp;&amp; cd yolov3 # git clone latest
python3 detect.py  # verify detection
python3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in a GCP Quickstart Guide VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, Pytorch &gt;= 1.0, etc.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!
