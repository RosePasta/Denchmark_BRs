	<summary>About batchsize and epoch</summary>
	<description>
Why did I set batchsize and epoch, but the number of steps was not consistent, such as 100 pictures, batchsize=1, epoch=1, so there should be 100 bacth, but no matter how I set it, bacth is 50, may I ask what caused this?
Please！！！！！！

 --accumulate specifies the number of batches to accumulate before an optimizer step, you may want to set this to 1. Default is 2.

Hello, thank you for your reply. I mean that regardless of the size of the data set or how to set the batch, it is all 50 steps
