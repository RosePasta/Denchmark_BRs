	<summary>GIoU is above 1</summary>
	<description>
When I run train script I get that the GIou parameter is between 0 to 4.
It is excepted that GIou is between -1 to 1

 GIoU is the GIoU loss

		All the losses shown (GIoU, obj, cls) are averaged for all loss elements in a layer, then summed for all layers, and then multiplied by their respective hyperparameters.

		How is the GIOU loss calculated?
		</comment>
		<comment id='4' author='alontrais' date='2019-12-03T03:28:51Z'>
		GIoU loss is:
hyp['GIoU'] * (
mean(GIoU_losses_yolo_layer1) +
mean(GIoU_losses_yolo_layer2) +
mean(GIoU_losses_yolo_layer2)
)
