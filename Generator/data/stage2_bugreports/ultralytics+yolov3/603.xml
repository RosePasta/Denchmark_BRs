	<summary>probelm about pre-training weights?</summary>
	<description>


1、on the https://pjreddie.com/darknet/  pre-training weights  include darknet53.conv.74  and yolov3.weights and darknet53_448.weighs  and so on .
i print the these file'weights, but the values are different。


import numpy as np

weight_path = "../weight/yolov3.weights"
fp = open(weight_path, "rb")
weights_1 = np.fromfile(fp, dtype=np.float32)

weight_path = "../weight/darknet53.conv.74"
fp = open(weight_path, "rb")
weights_2 =  np.fromfile(fp, dtype=np.float32)

weight_path = "../weight/darknet53_448.weights"
fp = open(weight_path, "rb")
weights_3 =  np.fromfile(fp, dtype=np.float32)
fp.close()

i = 6
print(weights_1[6])
print(weights_2[6])
print(weights_3[6])


2、in the new commit, why in models.py  load_darknet_weights(),   fp only reads 4  not 5  ??


3、if i only want to set backbone's weights by pre-training weights , how to init others weights, for example fpn or yolo detector layer?

 I assume they are different because the backbones are different. The header contents are explained in the comments:



yolov3/models.py


        Lines 302 to 309
      in
      470ef6b






 # Read weights file 



 with open(weights, 'rb') as f: 



 # Read Header https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/issues/2914#issuecomment-496675346 



 self.version = np.fromfile(f, dtype=np.int32, count=3)  # (int32) version info: major, minor, revision 



 self.seen = np.fromfile(f, dtype=np.int64, count=1)  # (int64) number of images seen during training 



 



 weights = np.fromfile(f, dtype=np.float32)  # The rest are weights 



 





In any case, if you are training a large network performance is better at final epoch (i.e. after 500,000 batches at batch-size 64) if no backbone is used. Our results exceed darknet training without using a backbone. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310&gt;#310&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
