Hello, I am training in my own training set. The loss is reduced and the map appears in one scene. Do you know what this is：
Computing mAP: 100%|██████████████████████████| 100/100 [00:07&lt;00:00, 12.93it/s]
all       200       338         0         0         0         0

 the bug was caused by a sigmoiding of the predicted wh during training. It is fixed now.
git pull and retrain and everything will work.
