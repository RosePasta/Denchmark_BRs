	<summary>The program is aborted maybe because of thread.</summary>
	<description>
After running detect.py with "python3 detect.py --source 0" and pressing q to exit, it becomes "terminate called without an active exception" and "aborted"
or "fatal exception not rethrown" and "aborted".
This is thought to be a problem caused by Thread.
Is there any solution?

		--source 0 is a webcam source. It is meant to run forever untill the q or escape key is pressed, or you can also kill the thread with ctrl c
