	<summary>Training model using weights/last.pt</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I training a model by using my custom data with
.
I should get the model weights file in  when I finish all epochs.
But I find the result is not convergence, then I want to use  weights and training continuously.
Hence, I use
 command but get the error blow.

I try to use
python train.py --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg --weights "weights/last.pt" --data data/coco.data --epochs 20 --resume and
python train.py --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg --weights "weights/last.pt" --data data/coco.data --epochs 20 --pre but still error.
What can I try, thanks.

  is simply a shortcut for .  should only be used at the very beginning of training, never on resuming training. If at all possible I highly recommend you train fully from start to finish, without stopping.

		这个问题我遇到过。把你默认权重改大一点就好了。现在已经训练了20个epoch，如果你想再训练20个，把默认的epoch数改成40.

 there is an LR scheduler built-in that reduces your LR at 80% and 90% of your total weights, so it is not recommended to train fully and then resume training.
