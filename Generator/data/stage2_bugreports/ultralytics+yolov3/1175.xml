Before submitting a bug report, please ensure that you are using the latest versions of:

Python 3.7
PyTorch 1.4.0
This repository (run git fetch &amp;&amp; git status -uno to check and git pull to update)

Your issue must be reproducible on a public dataset (i.e COCO) using the latest version of the repository, and you must supply code to reproduce, or we can not help you.
If this is a custom training question we suggest you include your train*.jpg, test*.jpg and results.png figures.

 thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 &amp;&amp; cd yolov3 # clone latest
python3 detect.py  # verify detection
python3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in a GCP Quickstart Guide VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, PyTorch &gt;= 1.4 etc. You can also use our Google Colab Notebook and our Docker Image to test your code in a working environment.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

		I have met the same issue. Could you tell me how did you solve it? Thank you in advance.
By the way, I ran a docker container with the newest version(v0) and in a multi-GPU environment.

 we are running docker containers with multi gpu training also right now without issue. You're going to have to include much more information if you expect any help.

		I found my mistake.
There would be some problems if you did not modify the config correctly.
In my case, I only modified filters three times but classes once, which is my negligence.
Hope this helps others.
