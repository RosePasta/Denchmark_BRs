&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When you run train.py script you get an exception, which I put in the title.
File "train.py", line 439, in &lt;module&gt; train()  # train normally File "train.py", line 259, in train plot_images(imgs=imgs, targets=targets, paths=paths, fname=fname) File "/home/pskalski/Documents/REPOS/YOLO_ROLLS/yolov3/utils/utils.py", line 936, in plot_images fig.savefig(fname, dpi=200) File "/home/pskalski/Documents/REPOS/YOLO_ROLLS/yolov3/.env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py", line 2180, in savefig self.canvas.print_figure(fname, **kwargs) File "/home/pskalski/Documents/REPOS/YOLO_ROLLS/yolov3/.env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/backend_bases.py", line 2021, in print_figure canvas = self._get_output_canvas(format) File "/home/pskalski/Documents/REPOS/YOLO_ROLLS/yolov3/.env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/backend_bases.py", line 1963, in _get_output_canvas .format(fmt, ", ".join(sorted(self.get_supported_filetypes())))) ValueError: Format 'jpg' is not supported (supported formats: eps, pdf, pgf, png, ps, raw, rgba, svg, svgz)
Locally this can be fixed by changing the extension of the saved image from .jpg to .png. But I've located the problem source here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/16083&gt;matplotlib/matplotlib#16083&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Just run train.py script.

 hi there, thanks for the bug report. We've seen this as well, it's caused by the matplotlib issue you linked to. The temporary fix we used for this was to uninstall pillow and reinstall pillow == 6.0:
pip uninstall pillow
pip install pillow==6.0
Then you should see this, and everything will work:
import PIL
PIL.__version__
'6.0.0'

 but in terms of what exactly we should do right now, I suppose it makes sense the change the output format to png, otherwise newcomers won't be able to use the repo out of the box?

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher&gt;@glenn-jocher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I think so. In fact, tomorrow I am publishing an article on the Medium, in which I write about your implementation of YOLO. And I have several scripts, which are based on your implementation. At the moment, if someone installs the environment in the default way, then they face a problem. I already have about 5 months of experience in working with your code, and therefore it's easier for me to find bugs. If you want I can make quick pull request changing these extensions?
