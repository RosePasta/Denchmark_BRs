	<summary>Tensorboard not writing on --resume</summary>
	<description>
Tried this last night and it created a new run file, but didn't write in it. I'm on Windows, I'll check whats up with this later this week and PR.

 ohhhhhh. So you are saying if you train 10 epochs, restart your computer then , Tensorboard will not recognize this as resumed training, and will instead start a new run folder?
This makes sense, I don't see an easy automatic way out of the problem.

		Ye it was creating a new run file, but wasnâ€™t even writing result to it (which is not normal).
Easy solution to this could be to allow us to tell the tensorboard writer what run it is when resuming or may be automate it and storing in the .pt aomething about tensorboard ? Probably not supportes yet by pytorch tho.

		Ok, I checked again this morning and it looks like the --resume writes in the new run folder it creates correctly. (May have to restart tensorboard for it to take effect)

		ah ok. Well I guess we'll just leave this open for now.
TODO: --resume to the same tensorboard run folder.

		I'll close this issue for now as the original issue appears to have been resolved, and/or no activity has been seen for some time. Feel free to comment if this is not the case.
