	<summary>Bug- Transfer learning is not working</summary>
	<description>
Hi Ultralytics,
Thanks a lot for sharing with us this YOLO code. It is amazing!
I am following this tutorial to learn YOLO: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Example:-Transfer-Learning&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Example:-Transfer-Learning&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

During testing, I used the command like this:

I got the error saying :
usage: train.py [-h] [--epochs EPOCHS] [--batch-size BATCH_SIZE] [--cfg CFG]
[--data DATA] [--multi-scale]
[--img-size IMG_SIZE [IMG_SIZE ...]] [--rect] [--resume]
[--nosave] [--notest] [--evolve] [--bucket BUCKET]
[--cache-images] [--weights WEIGHTS] [--name NAME]
[--device DEVICE] [--adam] [--single-cls]
train.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --transfer
I checked the train.py file, it does not have the parameter "transfer", so I think maybe this function is been removed in the latest version. Maybe my command is wrong.
May I know whether transfer learning is available in current code?
Thanks a lot for your help!

 —transfer has been removed.
You can train from pretrained weights simply by specifying them normally:
python train.py —weights ...
