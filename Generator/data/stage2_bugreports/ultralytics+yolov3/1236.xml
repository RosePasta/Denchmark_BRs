	<summary>Train a custom data set (flower), and use the trained weight file to detect objects. The result is wrong, and the detection results are cars and people.</summary>

		you forget to change class names. check your .names file and correct it as flower of some other classes. The order in .names file means classs0, class1,.......etc

I have modified the *,cfg  *.data *.names file.And the labels file and train.txt test.txt file are generated.
I have tried the following training commands, all of which generate weight files, but the above error occurs when detecting objects.
python train.py --data data/cell.data --weights weights/yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt --batch-size 4 --cfg yolov3-spp.cfg 
python train.py --data data/cell.data --weights weights/yolov3-spp-ultralytics.pt --batch-size 4 --cfg yolov3-spp.cfg
help me!

		oh okay, the train.py has parse --names, you may try to change the default or just add --names &lt;your .names file dir&gt;

		Hi, i was wondering how did you create the custom dataset ? I'm working on  a similar subject with dataset oxford flower with 102 species, but I didn't find a dataset with the annotations for object detection
