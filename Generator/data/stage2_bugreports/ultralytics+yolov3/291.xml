Traceback (most recent call last):

AssertionError: File Not Found data/samples/images/aaaaaa.jpg
Description:
After training process stopped, I wanted to test model performance on the weights best.pt I got. Firstly it will load my test images, but error information above always occurred after loading some images. In fact, the image aaaaaa.jpg existed in the data/samples/images and I can find it. In addition, other images were loaded without error. So, what's the reasion of it? I don't want to solve the problem by deleting that image. Any suggestion? I need help.

		I got it. This error caused by the corruption of my images. Remove the corrupt images and everything goes well.
