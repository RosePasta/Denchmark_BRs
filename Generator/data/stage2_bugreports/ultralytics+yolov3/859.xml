	<summary>Train single class/Transfer learning on custom dataset</summary>
	<description>
When i try to train a model on my custom dataset following instructions on Training single class/Transfer learning in evaluation time exception throws "RuntimeError: invalid argument 0: Sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 1. Got 6 and 85 in dimension 2". The training process runs like it is supposed to but when the evaluation is coming (test.py) in first insertion images to model it throws this exception. Firstly i tried changing the sizes of test dataset but it didn't help.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Train on one class
python3 train.py --data data/coco_1cls.data --cfg cfg/my_new_file.cfg --weigths weights/yolov3.pt

I also noticed that in transfer learning tutorial you put --transfer flag on train,py but when i check code i don't see this flag and when ruining with this flag it throws error.
