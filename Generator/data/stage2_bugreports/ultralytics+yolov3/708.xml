	<summary>Different computers, different results on detect script</summary>
	<description>
When I run the detect script with the same code, input and parameters on different computers with different CudaDevice I get different results. On the second computer, the program detects more objects than on the first computer.
On computer 1 Windows:
Namespace(cfg='cfg/yolov3-spp-3cls.cfg', conf_thres=0.1, data='data/coco.data', device='', fourcc='mp4v', half=False, img_size=2176, nms_thres=0.5, output='output', source='data/samples', view_img=False, weights='weights/best.pt')
Using CUDA device0 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='GeForce GTX 1650', total_memory=4096MB)
On computer 2 Linux:
Namespace(cfg='cfg/yolov3-spp-3cls.cfg', conf_thres=0.1, data='data/coco.data', device='', fourcc='mp4v', half=False, img_size=2176, nms_thres=0.5, output='output', source='data/samples', view_img=False, weights='weights/best.pt')
Using CUDA device0 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='GeForce GTX 1050 Ti', total_memory=4038MB)
The results:
On computer 1:
video 1/1 (1/9820) data\samples\original.MOV: 1248x2176 49 cars, 4 trucks, Done. (2.328s)
On computer 2:
video 1/1 (1/9820) data/samples/original.MOV: 1248x2176 191 cars, 4 trucks, Done. (0.949s)
What could be the reason, can it be solved?

		Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 &amp;&amp; cd yolov3 # clone latest
python3 detect.py  # verify detection
python3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in a GCP Quickstart Guide VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, PyTorch &gt;= 1.3 etc. You can also use our Google Colab Notebook and our Docker Image to test your code in working environment.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

		There has to be more to this than that. Do you have the correct weights? And was it just a clone of your script?

		Yes, it's the same weights, it's the same script.

 as I said above, if your error is not reproducible on a common dataset (COCO), in a common environment (the 3 above), we can not debug it.

		I'll close this issue for now as the original issue appears to have been resolved, and/or no activity has been seen for some time. Feel free to comment if this is not the case.
