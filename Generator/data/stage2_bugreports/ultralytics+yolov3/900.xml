	<summary>Ambiguity in understanding bounding box tensors</summary>
	<description>
In compute_loss function
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49546514/76075215-9cf7c880-5fc2-11ea-96be-b534a704041e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


While iterator is iterating , is it pointing one image at a time or not?
2 . If one image is being pointed at a time , then can someone explain what do the bbox and tbox tensors signify (because  for single variable , it is holding list of values instead.) .
For example , box1[0] should have one value which is x, but it is printing multiple values in list as you can see below , similarly same thing is happening for y,width,height


Please give me a clear explanation on why these random multiple values are being created for each values of box1 (predicted box) and box2(tbox).
in my case no of classes = 1. I have followed everything according to the custom data train plan given by you.

 the for loop iterates over the 3 output layers. All images are processed simultaneously.  is the image index, it states it in the comment.

		Your answer is not clear according to my question. Please give me solution
for this issue with clear explanation.




Thanks and best regards,

 I guess the question isn't clear. The loss function computes the losses between the labels and the predictions. All images are computed simultaneously, there is no for loop over images.

 so there's no 'random' values anywhere. There's the true boxes  and the predicted boxes .

		Yeah thanks for that. My batch size is 32
For every layer that we are iterating , pbox ,tbox values like 4*14 and
4*14 .(1st output layer)
4*26 , 4*26 (2nd output layer)
4*40 , 4*40 (3 rd output layer)
I want to know why length of tbox and pbox are same and  even want to
confirm whether the values inside the pbox and tbox are that of images or
does it have anchors too?

 yes, that looks fine. That means that you have 4 box coordinates in dimension 0, and then 14, 26, and 40 targets in the 3 yolo layers (among all your 32 images).

 the values here are for the objects in your image. pbox is the predictions, tbox is the targets that you have labelled. They are designed to both be the same shape of course.
