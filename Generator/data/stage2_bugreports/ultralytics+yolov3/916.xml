	<summary>iDetection iOS App Performance on  iPhone 8?</summary>
	<description>
Smartphone:

Device: iPhone 8
OS: iOS 13.3.1

Using YOLOv4-tiny I get about 12.5 FPS, but using YOLOv4 from 6 FPS to 4 FPS and seems FPS is not constant, i.e. it's reducing over time to some value is this result of overheating and throttling? or maybe performance depends on number of objects in the scene?
Does YOLO use ANE when runned on iPhone 8?

 great, thanks for your data point. The iPhone8 and iPhone X generation use the 0.6 TOPS capable A11 ANE.
The 30 FPS capability for both models is available starting with the 5.0 TOPS capable A12-A13 ANE devices, iPhone XS and iPhone 11.
Actual FPS will vary as well depending on background tasks, thermal state, and battery state of charge.

		Does YOLO use ANE when runned on A11? did you checked it? i.e. something like this &lt;denchmark-link:https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/does-my-core-ml-model-run-on-apples-neural-engine-d0a91d25297b&gt;https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/does-my-core-ml-model-run-on-apples-neural-engine-d0a91d25297b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

P.S. we can remove bug label, it's more like a question.

 no I didn't check it, but at your observed FPS it must be running. Like I said the A11 ANE is only 0.6 TOPS vs 5.0 TOPS now.
