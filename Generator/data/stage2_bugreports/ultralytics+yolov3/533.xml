	<summary>RunTime error using image_weights</summary>

with default argument, everything works fine but when image_weights set to True error happens

 img-weights are not recommended for training. The idea was to sample the dataset according to each image's weight, which would sample images with objects with worse mAPs more, such as toasters, but this led to early overtraining as the same images were sampled too often probably. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/310#issuecomment-517812648&gt;#310 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I am want to test and see the difference in results.
previous error is my mistake, and I fix it.
I have select 202 classes in open-image and train on them. when setting --img-weights this error occurred
File "..../yolov3/train.py", line 228, in train
w = model.class_weights.cpu().numpy() * (1 - maps) ** 2  # class weights
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (203,) (202,)
do you have any idea why this happen?
thnaks in advance

		I understand. If it works on the COCO data but not on your own it could be a problem with your data. Is your data zero indexed (the class numbers start from 0?).

 Yes zero indexed
in this line:


size of weights increase from 202 to 203

 ah yes! This adds the empty anchors to the weights vector for some experiments we did. If you comment this out does it fix the issue?
