Hello,
Is there a way to only initialize the 3 layers that do the classification to new weights/bias ?
Trying to change the cfg file for 21 classes (78 filters and 21 classes) gave me an error on the 81, 93 and 105 layers while trying to load the pre-trained weights (yolov3.pt). I know we had this in darkflow (Tensorflow version of yolov2), is there a way create new layers for the transfer learning ?

 the pytorch process is that the model is first initialized with random weights, and then optionally those can be replaced with a backbone, such as darknet 53, or a full model, such as yolov3.weights. If your class count is different from the standard, you will need to leave those layers unreplaced. There is a current issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/152&gt;#152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 open on the subject, so I'll close this as its a duplicate issue.
Additionally you can find more examples in our wikis:
