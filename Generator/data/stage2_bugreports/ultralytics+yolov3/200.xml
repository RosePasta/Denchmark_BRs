I randomly get the following error and execution stops:
"/var/spool/torque/mom_priv/prologue: line 41: echo: write error: Invalid argument"
This is since the new commits, I did not have this at commit:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/tree/f2cb8401236c130281ed94731e3f19dde0fdb211&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/tree/f2cb8401236c130281ed94731e3f19dde0fdb211&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have no idea which commit caused this, and it doesn't show any more information than just that error.  I run on Linux.
If i run the project from the commit mentioned above, it works fine, if run the latest, i get this error. Sometimes instantly, sometimes after a few commits. Is this something of this project or would this be an issue with my machine?

 the error seems to be in a file called mom_priv/prologue at line 41. We don't use this, I suspect its local to your environment.
In any case I just now fired up our GCP VM, git cloned a fresh copy of the latest repo, and ran detect.py, test.py, and train.py tests (test and train on coco_100img.data, train for 3 epochs).
Everything is operating as expected.
If you would like a stable environment you can try our GCP Quickstart guide:
