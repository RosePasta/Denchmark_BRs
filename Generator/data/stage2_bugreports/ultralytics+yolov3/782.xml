&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Export model as onnx and load this model in tensorrt. meet an error 'Segmentation fault (core dumped)'
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

change ONNX_EXPORT = True in model.py
load the onnx model in tensorrt. code is as below
import os
import sys
import cv2
import time
import numpy as np
import pycuda.autoinit
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import tensorrt as trt
from PIL import Image

def ONNX_build_engine(onnx_file_path):
G_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
EXPLICIT_BATCH = 1 &lt;&lt; (int)(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH)
with trt.Builder(G_LOGGER) as builder, builder.create_network(EXPLICIT_BATCH) as network, trt.OnnxParser(network, G_LOGGER) as parser:
print('1.1--Loading ONNX file from path {}...'.format(onnx_file_path))
with open(onnx_file_path, 'rb') as model:
print('1.2--Parsing ONNX model')
parser.parse(model.read())
builder.max_batch_size = 100
builder.max_workspace_size = 1 &lt;&lt; 30
print('1.3--Completed parsing of ONNX model')
with trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER) as builder, builder.create_builder_config() as config, builder.build_cuda_engine(network, config) as engine:
print('1.4--Building an engine from file {}; this may take a while...'.format(onnx_file_path))
serialized_engine = engine.serialize()
with trt.Runtime(TRT_LOGGER) as runtime:
runtime.deserialize_cuda_engine(serialized_engine)
print("1.5--Completed creating Engine")
#with open(engine_file_path, "wb") as fs:
#   fs.write(engine.serialize())
return engine
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Error&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt; Segmentation fault (core dumped)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 Hello, and thank you for your interest in our work! After reviewing your question we believe that this issue falls outside of the scope of this repository, which is limited to PyTorch and ONNX model training, inference and deployment.
We suggest you raise the issue directly under the package or source causing the problem. We will close this issue for now.
