	<summary>Coordinate clipping could be more precise?</summary>
	<description>
A question about coordinate clipping - in case where prediction bounding box is out of image, a coordinate clipping is performed (to "fix" coordinates less than 0 to be 0, and coordinates that are higher than image shape to be equal to image shape)



yolov3/utils/utils.py


         Line 164
      in
      4a4bfb2






 boxes[:, 3].clamp_(0, img_shape[0])  # y2 





But, since coordinates are given with indexes, a range of, say 416 pixels is given by [0, 415] (or more precisely [0, 416 - 1]) - would it not be more precise to clip it that way? This would require just four "-1" values on referenced line and above.
Should I make a pull request?

 oh! You may have just discovered a slight bug. Yes I see what you are saying, right now this clips from 0 to 416 for example, which is a range of 417 pixels. Are you sure the correct ranging would be 0-415 then and not 1-416? Yes please submit a PR!
Can you run test.py on coco with a before and after to see the mAP effect?

 says boxes are zero indexed, so I think your original answer is correct: 0-415 is correct.

		Will post test.py results in pull request comments
