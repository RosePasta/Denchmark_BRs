	<summary>84 Layer before convolutional layer must output image.: File exists</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I am trying to run launch yolo in ROS, based on the autoware package.
Unfortunately when I run the network with the config: yolov3-spp.cfg and the converted weights from yolov3-spp-ultralytics.weights I get an Error in layer 84:
84 Layer before convolutional layer must output image.: File exists
/vision/darknet/src/utlis.c:253: error: Assertion '0' failed.
The config input height and width are 608.
Loaded network config looks like this:
75 conv    512  1 x 1 / 1    19 x  19 x1024   -&gt;    19 x  19 x 512  0.379 BFLOPs
76 conv   1024  3 x 3 / 1    19 x  19 x 512   -&gt;    19 x  19 x1024  3.407 BFLOPs
77 conv    512  1 x 1 / 1    19 x  19 x1024   -&gt;    19 x  19 x 512  0.379 BFLOPs
78 max          5 x 5 / 1    19 x  19 x 512   -&gt;    23 x  23 x 512
79 route  77
80 max          9 x 9 / 1    19 x  19 x 512   -&gt;    27 x  27 x 512

82 max          13 x 13 / 1    19 x  19 x 512   -&gt;    31 x  31 x 512

		Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 &amp;&amp; cd yolov3 # clone latest
python3 detect.py  # verify detection
python3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in a GCP Quickstart Guide VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, PyTorch &gt;= 1.4 etc. You can also use our Google Colab Notebook and our Docker Image to test your code in a working environment.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

		I'll close this issue for now as the original issue appears to have been resolved, and/or no activity has been seen for some time. Feel free to comment if this is not the case.
