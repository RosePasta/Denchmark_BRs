 augmentation by definition will cause parts of the image to be offscreen if it includes rotation, shear, etc. Bounding boxes are transformed using the same affine transformation, and are clipped or removed if they fall off the edges of the augmented image. All of this should be correct.
If you believe otherwise can you provide specific augmented images you are concerned about?  provides the first batch of augmented training images for you to view once you start training:
