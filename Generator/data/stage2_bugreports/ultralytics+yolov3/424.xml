Describe the bug
Running python train.py from the repository's main directory (yolov3) on coco_1cls.data using 1cls config, I get the error File not found ../coco/images/val2014/COCO_val2014_000000121497.jpg even though I can see the data at the location.
I assume the file saved is ../coco/.. instead of coco/... as coco is inside the main path.
Could the author &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher&gt;@glenn-jocher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  tell which main directory he expects us to run train from?

I'm not the author ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I am sorry Gabriel, was by mistake.
I changed the txt file and it seems to work! But I want to understand this, I used transfer weights from coco, and did finetuning with coco 1 class, as mentioned in the tutorial for training with 1 class. After training, when I detect the image, I don't get any bounding box. Trying to figure out the possible reasons for that.

 what were your training results?

		Training result (mAP) is only 43%.

I guess it is because the finetuning is done only on 5 images? Actually I wanted to detect only people in my custom dataset, and my idea was to train the model using coco weights on coco dataset to only detect 1 class (person) and then use those weights and fine tune the model (and then maybe unfreeze some layers) to detect gender on my custom data.
Any knowledge regarding my idea or the issue is greatly appreciated.

		I would plot your results. But also 5 images is far too low to be of any use. To get coco-like results you will want 1000+ images per category, and/or 10,000+ instances per category.

Can you please tell it more specifically about changed the txt file ? Is that train.txt?
