	<summary>Cannot reproduce results in Example:-Train-Single-Class</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Running Example:-Train-Single-Class in google colab hangs and is not improving mAP
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Open Google Colab Notebook...
Run the following code (no change to yolo config files, random weights initialization)...
import time
import glob
import torch
import os
from IPython.display import Image, clear_output
print('PyTorch %s %s' % (torch.version, torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CPU'))




3.0+cu100 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='Tesla K80', major=3, minor=7, total_memory=11441MB, multi_processor_count=13)



!git clone &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  # clone
!bash yolov3/data/get_coco_dataset_gdrive.sh  # copy COCO2014 dataset (19GB)
%cd yolov3
!python3 train.py --data data/coco_1cls.data  --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg --batch-size 1 --accumulate 1
Real behavior
training hangs after 6 epochs.
If I provide additional argument --img-size 608 then it does not hang but mAP is 0 even after 200 iterations and is not improving.
Expected behavior
... is being trained and achieves stated results

 this tutorial hasnt been updated in a while, but if you look at the custom training tutorial it should have reproducible code. You can also look at this comment for the latest tutorial results with code to reproduce (recent from a few weeks ago):

 the single-class tutorial has been updated with the latest results and the latest code to reproduce. The biggest change was probably that backbones need to be specifically called for, before darknet53 backbone was loaded by default (now default behavior is no backbone).
