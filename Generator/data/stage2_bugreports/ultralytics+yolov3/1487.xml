	<summary>transfer to ONNX have warning</summary>
	<description>
hi, I transfer yolov4.pt to ONNX, but I have some warning as below:
Does these warnings inference the onnx result?
and I use onnx
**F:\Project\yolov3-master\utils\layers.py:60: TracerWarning: Converting a tensor to a Python boolean might cause the trace to be incorrect. We can't record the data flow of Python values, so this value will be treated as a constant in the future. This means that the trace might not generalize to other inputs!
if nx == na:  # same shape

if (self.nx, self.ny) != (nx, ny):
F:\Project\yolov3-master\models.py:157: TracerWarning: torch.tensor results are registered as constants in the trace. You can safely ignore this warning if you use this function to create tensors out of constant variables that would be the same every time you call this function. In any other case, this might cause the trace to be incorrect.

On the other hand, if all other views use the same memory chunk, but are disjoint (e.g. are outputs of torch.split), this might still be safe.

Hi..even i faced the same issue..did u find any solution for this? @cendelian
not yet , I turn to yolov3 and success

I face the same error with YOLOv3 also..Could u please guide me in solving it?

@cendelian

maybe you can try download the newest  code and train.
and then
1: set ONNX_EXPORT = True in model.py
2. run python detect.py
and it's OK.

Ok..Will try the same!

 I would recommend trying the YOLOv5 Export Tutorial:
