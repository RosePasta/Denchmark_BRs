 hey bud. This means that you've supplied class numbers in your labels that exceed the class count you specified in your *.data and *.cfg files. Classes are zero indexed, so for example if you specify classes=3 in *.data and *.cfg, your labels may only have classes 0, 1 and 2 present.

		So from what I can tell, my labels say 1,2,3 for classes. I can‚Äôt seem to
find any other numbers.

Should I just modify my classes to 3 then?

 your *.cfg and *.data simply need to match up in classes. It's ok to use the default yolov3-spp.cfg for example with 80 classes and supply labels that only go up to 15 classes (the remaining 65 spots on the output vectors will go unused, but it won't really hurt your training).
If you modify your classes to 3,  then your labels must either be 0, 1, or 2 (zero indexed).

		Were you able to solve this? I am starting to think that you might have reference it wrongly in the .data part. Assuming your .cfg file is properly formatted and being called properly.

		I updated Dark Chocolate, the COCOJSON -&gt; Darknet converter, so now classes are 0 indexed: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/joehoeller/Dark-Chocolate&gt;https://github.com/joehoeller/Dark-Chocolate&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and outputs:

My *.names file has 13 classes (the numbers are there as example, not actually in the file):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;0. person
1. bicycle
2. car
3. motorcycle
4. airplane
5. bus
6. train
7. truck
8. boat
9. traffic light
10. fire hydrant
11. stop sign
12. parking meter
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The *.data files has this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;classes=13
train=training_img_paths.txt
valid=training_img_paths.txt
names=data/training.names
backup=backup/
eval=coco
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tried the yolov3-spp.cfg as is and got same error as the copy I modified with all 3 [yolo] layers and the conv above it:
(4 + 1 + 13) * 3 = 54
[convolutional]
size=1

classes=13
num=9
jitter=.3
ignore_thresh = .7
truth_thresh = 1

The error still persists:

 that all looks right. Maybe I should update the error message to output more detail, hold on. Ok I've updated the assert statement in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/commit/0dd0fa7938f605833c85084f7f184445ca0b6fee&gt;0dd0fa7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Now it should give you more specific information. Can you git pull and try again?

Ok, nice!!! Now I know what the problem is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AssertionError: Model accepts 13 classes labeled from 0-12, however you labelled a class 17. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Let me go fix and I'll report back ;)

 if your terminal window is too short output from tqdm progress bar will wrap.
The images look like your labels need to offset the box centers by box width / 2 and box height / 2

		No prob, I am on it -&gt; "...box width / 2 and box height / 2", thnx for the tip!
Lastly, the img size says 416 as it's training, but in my *.cfg my img sizes are:

 the image size information in the cfg is not used. All of the files (train.py, detect.py, test.py) use the  argument, which is 416 default, and must be a 32-multiple.
Its hard to tell by eye if the new vals are correct, you just need to look at your test_batch0.jpg etc. to see that they overlay your objects correctly.

 yeah that looks a lot better. This happens because COCO box origins are in a corner (top left I think), while darknet format has origins in the center.
Note that the overlays you see are the labels, not the predicted boxes. Now you want to let it train for a few hours or a day or so and check your results.png.
So the best way to do it is to note the epoch your validation losses (on the bottom row) start increasing, and then restart your training again from zero to that --epochs number, to lock in the LR drops that are programmed at 80% and 90% of --epochs.

  4 Ques:
Q1. Is there a way to stop and then resume training?
Q2. You said, "note the epoch your validation losses (on the bottom row) start increasing, ", but this is all I get back:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5199900/70140673-e00c6d80-165a-11ea-907e-bb4be7674b0c.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Q3. When it is done, how to I access metrics like False Positive, False Negative, mAP etc? (Run the cmd for the utils or...?)
Q4. In the image above, is it really producing a mAP score of 0.841 by epoch 109, or is it overfitting?

  Please provide feedback - &gt;
Done training and got great results, mAP 0.96, which (I think) is competition grade.
My test results after running python3 detect.py --weights weights/last.pt --data data/custom.data --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-r.cfg --img-size 640  (notice -r is my version of spp.cfg) produced very accurate detection in image set.
So now I am wondering about the following:


Where is the final training loss and a graph showing training and validation loss over the epochs?


How can I get qualitative detection output images on validation set showing true positive
detections, false positives and false negatives (how can i do a validation set)?


How do I get a class-wise analysis of precision and recall of detections?


What would be the column headers for the results.txt file, I am unsure what numbers represent what(?)
For example, it just outputs this for last set of values:
272/272     8.13G      1.25     0.349     0.105       1.7       138       416     0.283     0.961     0.922  0.435      1.28      0.31    0.0511

 sorry I've been pretty busy lately. To answer your questions:

The final results should be in results.txt and results.png.
For the class by class results run python3 test.py --cfg ... --weights ... --data ... etc.

The column headers are in utils.utils.plot_results()

 Still the same error.
Is it because im training this only on the 8,800 16 bit thermal .tiff images?
Im not using any coco dataset.
I'm only training on 16bit thermal .tiff images
Do I also have to add coco to the training set with the thermal images?
If possible can you send me a path of folders you have placed those coco images to?

 yes ive updated the three  blocks of the filters, classes.
Do I have to include coco images in the training set?
Or just the ‚Äò.tiff‚Äô will do?

 ive added .tiff extension in the utils/dataset.py
Im just thinking if i should try training with .jpeg first tomorrow and see if I see the error again.
So one question to you, did u train both the 8bit jpeg and coco data for the Thermal object detection?

 yeah. I changed the filters and updated n=18.
Which means my filters would be (4+1+18)3 = 69
Ive updated the same in the cfg and tried. Doesnt work.
Some minor change is missing out.
So when you asked me to run ‚Äòpython3 train.py ‚Äîimg640.
I got an error stating ‚Äòcannot load ../coco/train2014/...
But im not using any coco dataset. Im only training the model on 8000 thermal images but no RGB.

 I just cloned your repository again and just added paths to the FLIR dataset with jpeg thermal images and the cfg you used for training.
I ran this command : python3 train.py --data data/custom.data --cfg cfg/yolov3-spp-r.cfg --weights weights/yolov3-spp.weights
when I Change the filters to 69 and classes to 18 in the cfg file. This is the error
Error : AssertionError: Model accepts 18 classes labeled from 0-17, however you labelled a class 18

 yes you can always use the default yolov3-spp.cfg (with no changes) to train custom datasets with up to 80 classes, like an 18 class dataset. It's not an optimal solution, but it works.

 Finally the training has started. I deleted all the 8000 images and their labels and only took 10 images with their labels and tried and it worked out. So, I'm assuming that the images in the train folder need their respective labels to train.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38422983/75415313-48fd3c00-5951-11ea-821c-0a27ada5072c.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Oh good!
The images used for training should not all need label files. We routinely take custom datasets and add COCO images sans labels for backgrounds. All that‚Äôs required is that the background images are listed in the *.txt file along with the rest of the (labeled) images.
