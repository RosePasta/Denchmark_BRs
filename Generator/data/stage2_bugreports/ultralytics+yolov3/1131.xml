	<summary>Question about the Calculation of predicted coordinates bx in code</summary>
	<description>
According to the calculation formula of bx: bx = sigmoid(tx) + cx, cx is the target upper left abscissa, so why not add gj and gi in this line of code?(In utils.py - 408)
pxy = torch.sigmoid(ps[:, 0:2])
If I don't add it, does it become bx = sigmoid(tx)?

 targets and prediction xy values are with respect to the nearest grid point. Adding cx to both would not alter the loss.
