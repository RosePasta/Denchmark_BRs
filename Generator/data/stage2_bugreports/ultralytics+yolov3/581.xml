	<summary>How or What is the use of  "--arc ARC  yolo architecture" argument ?</summary>
	<description>
you have done a wonderful job! Thanks for Sharing you work!
How can this argument help the training process --arc ARC  yolo architecture Should I need to pass the backbone weights because as per your recent comment backbone weights are also weights and not to pass at --ARC argument how this argument improves training process

 just leave this argument as the default. This modifies the network and training to different architectures, which affects whether BCE or CE loss is used for classification, and whether background is used as a seperate class or not, and whether positive weights are used for the obj and cls losses. The best performing results (which outperform darknet) are gotten using all default settings.
If you want to speedup training you can also use a backbone such as --weights weights/darknet53.conv.74 or --weights weights/yolov3-spp.weights
