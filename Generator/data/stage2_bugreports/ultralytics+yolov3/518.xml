	<summary>How to initial weights  when training Single Class?</summary>
	<description>
Hello, your code is very beautyful. I want to train Single Class, and following the "Example: Train Single Class" , it works. There is one question:
How to initial the weights ?
Is there some pretrained model for yolov3-spp-1cls.cfg?

 you can initialize with random weights, darknet53.conv.74 backbone, or yolov3-spp:

--weights ''
--weights weights/darknet53.conv.74
--weights weights/yolov3-spp.pt
