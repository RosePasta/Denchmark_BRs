		You may have incorrectly installed dependencies, or you may have incorrectly formatted your custom data.  Recommend you start off in a well understood environment and start training on COCO using the default settings, which are known to work correctly: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

From there its your responsibility to adapt your data correctly and provide a functioning environment that meets all the requirements outlines in the README. If you suspect issues due to the multithreaded DataLoader you always have the option to disable multithreading by setting --num-workers 0:
sudo rm -rf yolov3 &amp;&amp; git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3
cd yolov3
python3 train.py --num-workers 0
