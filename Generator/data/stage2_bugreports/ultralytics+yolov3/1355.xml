 thanks for the info. I'm sorry, I'm not sure what the cause may be. I would make sure you are not running out of system memory (free -h), and perhaps train with fewer GPUs to see if that alleviates the issue.

		Thanks for your answer ，train with fewer GPUs is alleviates the issue.

		I solve this problem
The number of dataset should be divided by batchsize.
If my number of dataset is 9999 but batch size is 4, it can ocuur error.
So you should be Set a multiple of 4. (delete three dataset).
Then you can use multiple GPU too.
======================================================
or
This code can help you

I hope the error will be solved well.

 thanks for the feedback. You should be able to train and test any size datasets with any size batches without problem. On the train side, COCO 2017 train is 118287 images for example, and we've trained this with no problems at batch size 8, 16, 64, 96, 30, etc. The test set there is 5000 images, and the testing is run at the same batch-size at training, so there are combinations which are clearly not evenly divisible, yet still train and test correctly.
