Hi, I am watching your code these days and I found it is very beautiful and I have some questions.
Such as:(The code in datasets.py)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39543924/82106763-a08f9480-9755-11ea-93a9-23d4a6916f62.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I want to know is here a function to do data augment.  'augment=False' Does it mean the aygment is closed as default?
And If I try 'python train.py' or 'python test.py'  How could I know whether I open the data augmentation?
Thank you for reply. Sorry to disturb you and maybe this is a simple question but I don't know the answer. Thank you for your advice.

 thank you, these are python default values that are used in the function in the absence of specifying an argument. So if you create an instance of LoadImagesAndLabels() without specifying a value for , it will be False.

Is that mean If clone the ropo and train the network ,the picture in the COCO will be enhanced as default .
Why I have this question, since I change the 'False' here to 'True' The training fails to start .

 don't alter these values. To get started see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
