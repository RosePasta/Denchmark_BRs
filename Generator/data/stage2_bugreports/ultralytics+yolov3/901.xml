	<summary>Target objectness</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;🐛 Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hello,
When using CIoU for the training, I got suddenly a nan objectness loss. When I looked in the code, I saw that the target objectness loss is the giou (or ciou in my case). However, the giou, diou and ciou can be negative, and thus produce nan in binary cross entropy. I think for the target objectness we should only use iou.

 there is a  in place here to prevent negative values. This produced better training results than using iou.
