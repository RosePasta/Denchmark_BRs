Dear @glenn-jocher ,

I have installed all the environment package, and I want to train my custom network using my custom dataset. However, when I input the following command, an error occur:
python train.py --cfg cfg/A.cfg --data data/obj.data --weights weights/A.conv.66

It seems that  not enough values to unpack, I don't know what it mean, What should I do now?

		Well I can’t say. If you can train normally given the default cfg, and the error occurs when you introduce the custom cfg, the source of the error would then be the changes you made.
Your backbone may also be the issue. You could try to train without it to see if the error goes away.

,
Thank you very much for your reply and help.
I confirm that I can train normally given the default cfg.
Yes, maybe my custom cfg has some problems, however, my custom cfg can be trained well on darknet.
So I don't know what should I do now....
Could you please give me your email address? and I think I can send my custom .cfg to you.
I would be appreciated if you can help me check it.
With best regards,
May
