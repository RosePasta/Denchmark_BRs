	<summary>Wrong result</summary>
	<description>
My dataset is a two-classes dataset.
train with yolov3 and detect,but only one class, the other class is detected wrong in every pic,but when train with yolov3-tiny and detect with the weights, the result is right.

@JawyZhang use tiny then?

then it performances well. So strange that yolov3 performances worse than tiny

 recommend yolov5 for all future work.

I got exactly the same error as yours. Could you please describe how you finally dealt with the problem on YOLOv3 (not tiny)?
