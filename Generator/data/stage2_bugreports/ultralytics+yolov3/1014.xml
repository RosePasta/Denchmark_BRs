	<summary>Boxes dont fit into the object  Yolov3-spp on thermal images</summary>
	<description>
Hi Glenn.
I have trained yolov3-spp on thermal images.
Default epochs are 273. When i trained it for 273, there were no detections. But when i trained it for 500 Epochs.
I get detections. But the boxes dont fit into the object.
Can you tell me if my x,y Iou is wrong? Or how can i look at it?

 your boxes origins seem to be offset by half of the width and height, which means your labels are likely similarly shifted.
You should check your train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg to verify your labels. The labels should be normalized xywh, where xy are the center coordinates of the box (looks like your origin is at a corner).

		Hello. How can I normalize all labels which are already labeled and saved with pixels (from LabelImg)?
Is it possible to you my labels also in xml or do I need to have only txt?
Thank you
