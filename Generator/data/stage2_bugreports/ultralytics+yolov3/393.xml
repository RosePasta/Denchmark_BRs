Hi, after I run train.py, I got this error:
(I downloaded yolov3-spp.pt from your google drive and opt.transfer=True )

 ah yes this makes sense, we need to update all of the *.pt models in this Google Drive folder with the updated dictionaries. In the meantime you can use the darknet yolov3-spp.weights file, which has identical weights to the yolov3-spp.pt.
The repo will automatically download darknet weights as needed, i.e. simply run python3 detect.py.

 you might also be able to simply do this conversion yourself. If you have downloaded yolov3-spp.weights then you should be able to convert it to a correct *.pt model with the following python code:
from models import *; convert('cfg/yolov3-spp.cfg', 'weights/yolov3-spp.weights')

 the *.pt models have been corrected and are now being uploaded to the Google Drive folder. Please wait about 15 minutes and then try to download the updated models. Thank you!
