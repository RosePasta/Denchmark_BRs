	<summary>Cannot visualize model structure in TensorBoard</summary>
	<description>
I want to look the network structure in TensorBoard, so I run following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import torch
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
from models import *

net = Darknet("cfg/yolov3.cfg")
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

with SummaryWriter(comment='yolo v3') as w:
    w.add_graph(net, x)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but got a very strange error:
TracerWarning: Converting a tensor to a Python float might cause the trace to be incorrect. We can't record the data flow of Python values, so this value will be treated as a constant in the future. This means that the trace might not generalize to other inputs!
what should I do ? can you give me some suggestion?

 that's not an error, that's a warning. I don't use this functionality myself so I can't advise you on it. Can you post a screenshot of what the network structure looks like (out of curiosity)?

		yes, that's a warning, but it will report a very strange error, I cannot paste the error. That's why I cannot open tensorboard, there is nothing can be written into tensorboard. Could you please run the following code?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import torch
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
from models import *

net = Darknet("cfg/yolov3.cfg")
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

with SummaryWriter(comment='yolo v3') as w:
    w.add_graph(net, x)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

then you will get a very strange error...

 yes if I use your code I also get a very long error. If I run the demo everything works well:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html#torch-utils-tensorboard&gt;https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html#torch-utils-tensorboard&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If I try to reproduce the demo, using yolov3 model in place of resnet model, I get the same error. Well I don't really know how to solve it.
The actual warnings are related to taking the shapes of objects are runtime. ONNX export shows similar warnings at these locations.

  There is a little question about anchors, I noticed that there are 9 anchors in  file, but only predice 3 anchors each grid, so ,  I cannot unterstand that, could you tell me why we cluster 9 anchors but only predict 3 anchors ?

 3 anchors are used at each of the 3 yolo outputs, 9 anchors total. Suggest you read the YOLOv3 paper on arxiv.

 I got this to work. The trick was to run the model first, which defined some of those constants.
img = torch.zeros(1,3,512,512)
_ = model(imgs)
tb_writer.add_graph(model, imgs)
