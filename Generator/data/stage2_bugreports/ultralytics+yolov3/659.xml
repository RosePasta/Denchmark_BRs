	<summary>Unstable training speed</summary>
	<description>
It's really strange that my training speed used to reach 15s for each epoch, and GPU usage 96%.
However, I can never reach so good GPU-util again(about 10% when training ) after I rebooted my computer and modified some irrelevant code just now.What's wrong with the code ,or my GPU?

		Are you sure your paths are correct? Because we had a similar problem. We were getting crazy load times. And then realized that it was not loading properly. So after we fixed that we started getting more stable times.
Of course what code did you modify?

Thanks for your advice, umm paths means  image paths? I''ve  checked it , and no problems found.
This question really frustrates me. In fact, I've been suffered from low gpu-util for a long time, but it suddenly soared these day, unlucklly it went wrong again.....
btw, I just modified code about data augmentation , hyperparameter, and anchor rejection part(in utils.py), and withdrawed all ops above still didn't work .

Sorry for my carelessness, I forget opening my anchor visualization code, which is time-consuming, close it and the problem is solved! :p
Thank you all the same.
