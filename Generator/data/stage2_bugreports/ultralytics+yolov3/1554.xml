	<summary>Remove cached labels before training</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

My custom dataset is too large to fit into RAM with --cache-images option enabled. So, I decided to split it into multiple parts and run training procedure sequentially with each part. On the second pass, I found that mAP and F1 dropped significantly (mAP ~ 0.9 -&gt; 0.008). When I started to figure out what was going on, I discovered that the labels are not cached again and I need to delete them like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!rm -f data/my_custom_dataset/training/labels.npy
!rm -f data/my_custom_dataset/validation/labels.npy
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create a small custom dataset and split it into multiple parts, then train model sequentially with each part.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python train.py ... --data data/my_custom_dataset/part1.data --epochs 75 ...
$ python train.py ... --data data/my_custom_dataset/part2.data --epochs 150 --weights weights/best.pt ...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Invalidate labels cache for subsequent runs.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
