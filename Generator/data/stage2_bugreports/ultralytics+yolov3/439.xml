Hi!I am a beginner.First of all, thank you very much for your excellent code.
I downloaded your code and installed the environment as required.I directly ran the train.py,and then I had the above problem.I didn't know how to handle it.
I did the following work：

Go to install your code without doing any changes.
Click on the train.py.
At first,I saw the "Download https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74".And I had been waiting for a while.
Then the above error message appeared.

How can I solve it?Please enlighten me.Thank you very much!

 I don't know, this is not reproducible in a working environment. It could be your download failed, try deleting the downloaded file and trying again, or simply delete the whole repo and try again.

num means the anchor box number.
you just change the filters = (5+classesnum)*3 before each yolo layer and classes=7
