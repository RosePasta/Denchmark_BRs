	<summary>COCO API RESULT is ZERO</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;
Your computing resutl is TRUE yet  the result of COCO API is Nothing&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

BUT
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34357479/79696238-1bc46e80-82ae-11ea-9500-46c19550bec6.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I try some other pictures, it works then.

 the pycocotools mAPs are only intended for testing on COCO, if you have other data they will not work correctly.
Also your testing speeds seem very slow, perhaps single or double GPU testing might be faster:
python3 test.py --device 0
python3 test.py --device 0,1

 I don't quite understand. To reproduce the correct COCO mAPs you can run the code here:

If I input a batch of 100size, it would run error.
BUT I split the same batch images into small parts and then test the each small part, it would run out the correct results.

 oh, are you saying you get different results with different batch sizes?
We've validated that batch size has no effect on test.py in CPU and single GPU modes, I don't know if multiple GPU has been tested. If you test with python3 test.py --device 0 do you get the same result?
