&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Training custom dataset.
python3 train.py --cfg cfg/yolov3-boat.cfg  --data data/boat.data --weights weights/yolov3-boat_last.weights

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Python 3.5 , cuda 10, cudnn 7.4.1
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS:  Ubuntu
Version 16.04

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

i am training custom dataset, my dataset is in another directory . when i run train.py it cached labels but throw error for images.
I am able to train with another Fork with same dataset structure (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/erikguo/yolov3&gt;https://github.com/erikguo/yolov3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
I do not know why it throw the error while reading images. any suggestion?
As I observe it not reading only image values it is reading whole path. Please see attached screen short as well
train()  # train normally
File "train.py", line 207, in train
cache_images=opt.cache_images),
File "/home/littro/yolov3/utils/datasets.py", line 297, in 
s = np.array(s, dtype=np.float64)
ValueError: could not convert string to float: '/home/littro/darknet/build/darknet/x64/data/cocoBoat/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/JPEGImages/000000528411.jpg'

 it is trying to read *.shapes files. If they become corrupted this could happen. Please delete all *.shapes files in your data and yolov3 directories and try again.

Sir thank you for your response. what do you mean by .shapes file? There is no .shapes file in my dataset. there are only labels in the .txt format and images in the .jpg format.

 .shapes files are created when training. Simply search your folders for *.shapes files, delete any found, and retrain.

     I found a deleted .shapes file but it still show same error . I check this is the very first  image in the training list, so it can not read the images , i think there is something wrong with the code, not with the data because as i said it is working with some other fork.

 there is nothing wrong with the repo. We are training multiple custom datasets for multiple customers at this moment, and all are operating correctly.
In any case, you don't have the latest code, because your line 297 is not the same as the current line 297. I'll past you our default response.
Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 &amp;&amp; cd yolov3 # clone latest
python3 detect.py  # verify detection
python3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in a GCP Quickstart Guide VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, PyTorch &gt;= 1.3 etc. You can also use our Google Colab Notebook and our Docker Image to test your code in working environment.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

		This happens because 'valid' in '.data' is in a different extension than '.txt'
