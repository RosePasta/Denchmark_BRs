		Dear Author
Three days, I asked you a question.  I could not get the result files since I commented out several lines about" SummaryWriter".  If I did not comment out these lines, I would meet the errors above. That is, when I run the code from your repository(I do not change any thing), I meet this issue.
Could you tell me how to solve this issue? Thanks a lot.
By the way, if I can run this successfully, I will get some txt files. Do you also release a script to draw these results.txt files?
Best regards
Jingwei

 you have environment issues unrelated to this repo. You need to install the latest versions of all requirements.txt dependencies. I'll also link you to working environments here:
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Reproduce Our Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

To access an up-to-date working environment (with all dependencies including CUDA/CUDNN, Python and PyTorch preinstalled), consider a:

GCP Deep Learning VM with $300 free credit offer: GCP Quickstart Guide
Google Colab Notebook with 12 hours of free GPU time: Google Colab Notebook
Docker Image from https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/yolov3. See Docker Quickstart Guide

Hi!have you solved the problem?

		utils.utils.plot_results() plots results.txt files, as the readme clearly states.
