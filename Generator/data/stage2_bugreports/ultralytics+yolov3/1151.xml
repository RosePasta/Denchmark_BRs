	<summary>RuntimeError: DataLoader worker (pid 3855) is killed by signal</summary>
	<description>
Thanks for your great work! I met this problem when I train my costume dataset. My environment is Linux, python=3.7.4 pytorch=1.5 torchvision=0.6. I train normally before the 55th epoch. Do you know how can I deal with that? I use default num_works=8.

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "train.py", line 412, in 
train()  # train normally
File "train.py", line 267, in train
loss, loss_items = compute_loss(pred, targets, model)

RuntimeError: DataLoader worker (pid 3855) is killed by signal: Bus error. It is possible that dataloader's workers are out of shared memory. Please try to raise your shared memory limit.

		BTW, the RAM is 32G, and the GPU is V100 with 32G memory.

		You are out of system RAM (not GPU ram). Type  to see details. Suggest you create swap mem: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart#4-optional-extras&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/GCP-Quickstart#4-optional-extras&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, I use a server instead of my PC so that I can't use
the sudo command. But I decrease the num_workers to deal with that. Thanks!

 ah yes, that works as well. Also if you are using --cache to cache images that will eat up your system RAM quickly on large datasets. For COCO this uses up to 150GB RAM for example.
