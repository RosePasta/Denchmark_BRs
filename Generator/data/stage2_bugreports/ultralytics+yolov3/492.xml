	<summary>how to convert darknet53.conv.74 to yolov3 format?</summary>
	<description>
Actually, I have converted yolov3.weights to yolov3.pt by using the convert function.
but when I tried to convert darknet53.conv.74  does not work.
Do you know how should convert darknet53.conv.74   weights!?
thanks

 oh, this is not a use case we had tested, so it may not work.
darknet53.conv.74 is not an object detection network in itself, it's basically yolov3 up through layer 74, which includes all of the feature extraction convolutions. You can use it as a backbone for training.
