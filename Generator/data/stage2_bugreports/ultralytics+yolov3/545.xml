	<description>
Thanks for your great work!!
It seems to be a small flaw on follow code :



yolov3/utils/utils.py


        Lines 528 to 537
      in
      ee319ae






 elif nms_style == 'MERGE':  # weighted mixture box 



 while len(dc): 



 if len(dc) == 1: 



 det_max.append(dc) 



 break 



 i = bbox_iou(dc[0], dc) &gt; nms_thres # iou with other boxes 



 weights = dc[i, 4:5] 



 dc[0, :4] = (weights * dc[i, :4]).sum(0) / weights.sum() 



 det_max.append(dc[:1]) 



 dc = dc[i == 0] 





In NMS mode MERGE, once dc[0]'s iou with other boxes are less than nms_thres , all elements in i will be False ,leading to weights=0 ,further weights.sum()=0!
In the end , dc[0] is equal to nan , and the program will get stuck in a loop.

 ah thanks for the feedback! Have you tested a fix? How does the fix affect mAPs on yolov3-spp.weights? Thanks!

 thanks ming. Let me know if you figure this out, it would be very important to fix any bugs in the NMS code!
