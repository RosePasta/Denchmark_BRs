		If ntargets is 0 then no labels are found during training. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 also if targets is 0 during testing mAP, then there are no labels found for the images during testing, which is why your mAP is probably 0. This just means that your labels are not being properly found. There are checks for this in the latest version, you should  to get the latest and try again (or git clone a new copy of the repo), and make sure that your labels are properly formatted per the tutorials.
