	<summary>IndexError: list index out of range when training custom data</summary>
	<description>
Hi, thank you very much for your contribution in this nice repo.
I met a problem when training custom data showing IndexError: list index out of range
I trained custom data with the bash code:
python3 train.py --epochs 300 --cfg ./cfg/yolov3-spp_endo.cfg --data ./data/edd_20200213.data --device 1 --weight ''
After all the epochs are finished , the error message shows that:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "train.py", line 425, in 
train()  # train normally
File "train.py", line 375, in train
plot_results()  # save as results.png
File "/home/hzy/yolov3/utils/utils.py", line 977, in plot_results
results = np.loadtxt(f, usecols=[2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 10, 11], ndmin=2).T
File "/home/hzy/.conda/envs/pt14/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py", line 1159, in loadtxt
for x in read_data(_loadtxt_chunksize):
File "/home/hzy/.conda/envs/pt14/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py", line 1080, in read_data
vals = [vals[j] for j in usecols]
File "/home/hzy/.conda/envs/pt14/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/npyio.py", line 1080, in 
vals = [vals[j] for j in usecols]
IndexError: list index out of range

I tried to quote the plot_result() function in train.py in line 373-374, and it works well without error.
Any advice to solve this problem? Thanks a lot!!!

 that's really strange! It will search for any file called results*.txt in your yolov3 directory and your downloads directory (if it exists), and plot them all togethor, so if you have other similarly named files this will cause an error.



yolov3/utils/utils.py


         Line 976
      in
      2cf23c4






 files = glob.glob('results*.txt') + glob.glob('../../Downloads/results*.txt')

		We haven't seen this before, but we could always put a try except clause there for each file it tries to plot.

		Can you try to modify your plotting function like this to see if another file is causing the error?
    for f in sorted(files):
        try:
            results = np.loadtxt(f, usecols=[2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 10, 11], ndmin=2).T
            n = results.shape[1]  # number of rows
            x = range(start, min(stop, n) if stop else n)
            for i in range(10):
                y = results[i, x]
                if i in [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]:
                    y[y == 0] = np.nan  # dont show zero loss values
                    # y /= y[0]  # normalize
                ax[i].plot(x, y, marker='.', label=Path(f).stem, linewidth=2, markersize=8)
                ax[i].set_title(s[i])
                if i in [5, 6, 7]:  # share train and val loss y axes
                    ax[i].get_shared_y_axes().join(ax[i], ax[i - 5])
        except:
            print('Plotting error for %s, skipping file' % f)

		Thanks for your reply and advice.
Thereâ€˜re results.txt and results_helmet.txt in the directory yolov3 as it is cloned from GibHub indeed.
I run the train.py after removing them and it really works. If there are other similarly named files, it will cause an error.
The problem is solved by removing all the files as ./results*.txt and ../../Downloads/results*.txt.
Thanks a lot!!

 great, good to know! I've made a commit so this shouldn't happen again in the future:
