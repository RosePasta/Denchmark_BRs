Could you provide yolov3-asff pretrained ?
thank you!

 Thanks for quick reply. I have a question, in yolov3-asff.cfg, I see with 80 class -&gt; 258 filter. May be formular (6 + num_class) * 3 = filter ?

 yes, this is 85 * 3 plus 3 output channels for the asff operations.
Honestly though we could not get performance improvements with ASFF, I would recommend training with yolov3-spp with all default settings if you are training a custom dataset. If you are doing research, then go ahead and experiment!

 After pull latest code, the bug still remain. I only change num_class in yolov3-asff.cfg from 80 -&gt; 2 &amp; filter from 258 -&gt; 24. It seems pretrained model doesn't compatible with asff config. Do you know why ?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30823943/80299168-797c1d80-87bc-11ea-8a4c-4dc6905dc128.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 asff is a special cfg, it needs 3 extra output channels at each output layer, so you'd need 27 channels in each place you have 24 now.

 ah nevermind, it seems you already did this. Then as the error message says, your pretrained weights are not compatible with the cfg. You need to train from scratch:
python train.py --weights ''

 I train my custom dataset which has 4 classes, and I set the  in [yolo] and change all the  to  in the yolov3-asff.cfg as you said. I train it:

But I got this:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42533211/81792575-d0168500-953a-11ea-8b7a-3c118ee038b2.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Do you know where I am wrong？

 yes you are correct, they are not compatible. If you want to use this cfg you should train from scratch

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ChrisLiiiii&gt;@ChrisLiiiii&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ah, I see the problem. asff needs 3 extra filters per output layer, which is why there are 258 and not 255. So add 3 filters: filters=33.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher&gt;@glenn-jocher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I have tried your suggestion to change 30 to 33, but I still get this similar results:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42533211/81893142-7fa53300-95df-11ea-84f4-76beddb8a5c1.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In my opinion, the dataset has 4 classes so the filters need to be changed to (4+5)*3+3=30 instead of 33, is that right?
And another thing I'm not sure about is whether I should change all the filters=258 to filters=30? Other than that, I only change the [yolo] classes to 4.
I'm sorry I bothered you when you were so busy, I really appreciate your help!

 ah, yes if the default would have been 27 filters with yolov3-spp then yes you should simply add 3 to that value. If its not working then it may be an error somewhere else in the cfg. I'd start with yolov3-spp.cfg anyway, we could not gete asff to show improvement in our own tests.

I have the same problem as the friend above. When I + 3, I reported the same error. Please tell me how to solve it. Thank you.

I had this problem because I didn't set ASFF = True in the models.py



yolov3/models.py

Thank you very much for your suggestion. I can do the experiment now！Could you tell me  your precision when you run yolov3-asff? Does it have a high precision?Thank you again!

I did the experiment on my custom dataset.
To be honest, ASFF did not improve the accuracy of my experiment, probably because of the lack of pre-trained weights.

If there is no pre training weight, the results of more training rounds should be the same. Thank you for your answer. I will communicate with you after the experiment. Before + 3, the accuracy is about 0.06, and I hope to have a good experimental result after the change.

 Do you mean the accuracy of your experiment is only 6%? That's quite bad. Maybe your targets are very difficult to be detected?

Haha，It is before the number of filters is increased by 3, the dataset can reach 97% in v3. After the change(+3) is in training now, hope to have a good result.
