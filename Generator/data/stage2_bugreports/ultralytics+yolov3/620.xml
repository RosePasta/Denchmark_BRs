	<summary>Resume with transfer</summary>
	<description>
Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher&gt;@glenn-jocher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I was training coco only for 3 class using yolov3-spp weights and transfer, since I don't have much time to train from scratch. I stopped my training process several times in between and restarted using --resume. But when I do --resume, it takes the weigths from last.pt. I was wondering if it still uses the weights from yolov3-spp or it just lost that track and trains with the last weight? Since that will worsen the result as my model wasn't converged at last.pt.

		Oh, I realised the answer to this question, this was baseless. Sorry for raising issue for this.
For those who might ever wonder like me, the model uses weights only in the first epoch to get started with the weights, in this case the last.pt would have captured the essence of yolov3-spp in its feature extractor already, with additional changes to the final part.
