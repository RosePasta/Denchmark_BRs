	<summary>Why do i train  with  no transfer learning have biger mode parameter than transfer learning?</summary>
	<description>
Thanks for you great work!
I find that i get the weight about 250MB when I use transfer learing from begin,but if i don't use transfer learning,i will get about 500MB from begin,i do nothing other change.why?

 the weights size is exactly the same in both cases. The backup checkpoints contain the optimizer state at that epoch, which is another 250 MB. If you train untill the last epoch, then last.pt has it's optimizer stripped, reducing the filesize from 500 to 250 MB.

but i have get the 500m .pt file,how can i delete the other parameters, like epoch,best_fitness,optimizers, i just need the model key

Thanks a lot! It worked!
