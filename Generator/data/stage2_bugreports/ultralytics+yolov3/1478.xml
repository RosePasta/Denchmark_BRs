	<summary>RuntimeError: shape '[256]' is invalid for input of size 0</summary>

I'm trying to convert the yolov4.cfg and yolov4.conv.137 weights to yolov4.pt but i'm running into the following error while using the convert module:
Model Summary: 327 layers, 6.39377e+07 parameters, 6.39377e+07 gradients Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "/home/praneet/yolov4_pytorch_kaist/yolov3/models.py", line 437, in convert _ = load_darknet_weights(model, weights) File "/home/praneet/yolov4_pytorch_kaist/yolov3/models.py", line 373, in load_darkne                                                                                                                         t_weights bn.bias.data.copy_(torch.from_numpy(weights[ptr:ptr + nb]).view_as(bn.bias)) RuntimeError: shape '[256]' is invalid for input of size 0 
Any idea why this issue arises at the end because I feel the conversion has suceeded
