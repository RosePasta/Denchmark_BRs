When using webcam, a window is displayed for each frame.
The window name on line 107 of detect.py is a variable.
This causes another window to be displayed each time the frame changes.
Shouldn't the window name be a fixed value?

 sorry this should be fixed now. We noticed this error a couple days ago, so its likely you pulled within the last week, but the latest code should not do this. Please git pull and try again.
