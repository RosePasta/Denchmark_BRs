	<summary>question about "hyp adjust" when resuming training</summary>
	<description>
after training my custom dataset, I have a question. Does resuming simply just resume the weights or as well as the hyp?

		Resume resumes the weights and the optimizer gradients. hyps are initialized the same way whether or not --resume is used.
--resume is exactly the same as --weights weights/last.pt
