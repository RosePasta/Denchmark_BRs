 I downloaded and compiled the lastest version of this repository, but the torch_utils.py has been changed and now it automatically selects cpu to train, I have checked torch_utils.py and i think it should automatically selects all GPUs of my computer. What's the problem and how can i use GPU to trian ?

		Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This is an automated response. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov3  # remove exising repo
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 &amp;&amp; cd yolov3 # git clone latest
python3 detect.py  # verify detection
python3 train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for exact details on how to format your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in a GCP Quickstart Guide VM we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, Pytorch &gt;= 1.0, etc.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!
