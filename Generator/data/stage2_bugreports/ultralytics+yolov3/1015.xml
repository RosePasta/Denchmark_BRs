Hi,I have translated a VOC2007 dataset to coco's style.
And when I start to train with this code:
python3 train.py --weights weights/yolov3.pt --cfg cfg/yolov3.cfg
I encounted this problem
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39543924/78518128-241ea300-77f2-11ea-9406-28fd0a795f60.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you teach me how to handle this bug?

 I don't recognize the error. You should git clone the latest repo and ensure your dependencies are up to date. I'll link you to working environments here.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Reproduce Our Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

To access an up-to-date working environment (with all dependencies including CUDA/CUDNN, Python and PyTorch preinstalled), consider a:

Ok  Maybe be I  want to use many GPUs to run this program.Can you tell ne which file contains the code that I can used to run the program in serval GPUS, I cnnnot find this in train.py.Thank you four reply.
I tried some ways such as(add this code in train.py):
` devices_ids = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = nn.DataParallel(model,devices_ids=devices_ids)

# Initialize model
model = Darknet(cfg).to(device)`
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But it didn't works. Thank you

 yes of course. For 4 devices do this. Also remember to install nvidia apex for fastest training.
python3 train.py --device 0,1,2,3
