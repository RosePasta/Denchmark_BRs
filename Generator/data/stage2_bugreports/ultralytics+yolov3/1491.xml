I am training a electric meter counter recognition using Yolov3.
However after following the tutorial on custom dataset and training for 1 epoch the bounding boxes that gets generated in
test_batch0_gt.jpg (which is the ground truth for training generated by the library is incorrect as show in bottom) is out of position while the actual bounding are actually like on the top.
This is resulting in incorrect prediction even tho my mAP is very high as the target is getting wrongly generated.
Is there a bug in generating target boxes?

		Your annotations are incorrect, as your images show. Your box center coordinates are off by half width and height.

		I have the same issue, and I am sure, that my annotations is correct, that confirm test_batch0_gt.jpg
So, if you view train_batch0.jpg, you see, that bouding boxes is incorrect, but test_batch0_gt.jpg is showing that annotations is correct

		Actually I made a mistake in annotation.Your annotations should be
xcentre,ycentre,width and height and not the edge coordinates.
