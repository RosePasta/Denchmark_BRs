	<summary>getting a 404 on coco2017demos.zip</summary>
	<description>
Following along with the custom training tutorial, this:
$ python3 -c "from yolov3.utils.google_utils import gdrive_download; gdrive_download('1h0Id-7GUyuAmyc9Pwo2c3IZ17uExPvOA','coco2017demos.zip')"
gets me a 404 not found on that file.  Did this get deleted or moved?
