	<summary>[BUG] Missing load_mean_dict function for in case use_6d is False</summary>
	<description>
First, thank you for your great research and making the code available.



VIBE/lib/models/spin.py


         Line 335
      in
      731c273






 from lib.models.hmr import load_mean_dict 




 the function load_mean_dict is imported from lib.models.hmr
But there doesn't seem to be a  module in the code, I assume it is based on the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr/blob/537f1b2c91beb71cb61a388bf8f6504516b875a8/src/trainer.py#L179&gt;original&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  code?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mtngld&gt;@mtngld&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for your interest. That part is unused, I forgot to delete that part. We only use 6D representation as the output. We used an HMR model reimplemented in pytorch to perform ablation experiments, but it is not included in this repo.
