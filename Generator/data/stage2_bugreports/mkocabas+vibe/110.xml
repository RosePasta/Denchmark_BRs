 Hi, according to the 3dpw descriptions of the readme of 3dpw, the 2D joint detections in Coco-Format for each actor.  I think the below order is right.
def get_coco_joint_names():
return [
"nose",      # 0
"neck",       # 1
"lshoulder",       # 2
"lelbow",       # 3
"lwrist",       # 4
"rshoulder",       # 5
"relbow",      # 6
"rwrist",       # 7
"lhip",       # 8
"lknee",       # 9
"lankle",       # 10
"rhip",       # 11
"rknee",       # 12
"rankle",       # 13
"leye",       # 14
"reye",       # 15
"lear",       # 16
"rear",       # 17
