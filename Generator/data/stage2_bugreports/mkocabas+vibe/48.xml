	<summary>[BUG] Demo code crashing with temporal tracking</summary>
	<description>

OS: running the demo notebook on google Colab
your python version: 3.6.9
your pytorch version: 1.4.0

When running the demo instruction below, I have an error. It occurs when I try to run with the temporal SMPLify algo as per the demo document:
!python demo.py --vid_file sample_video.mp4 --output_folder output/ --tracking_method pose --display --run_smplify
then I get the following error (it seems some files are missing in the repository):
Running "ffmpeg -i sample_video.mp4 -f image2 -v error /tmp/sample_video_mp4/%06d.png" Images saved to "/tmp/sample_video_mp4" Input video number of frames 300 Traceback (most recent call last): File "demo.py", line 383, in &lt;module&gt; main(args) File "demo.py", line 83, in main tracking_results = run_posetracker(video_file, staf_folder=args.staf_dir, display=args.display) File "/content/VIBE/VIBE/lib/utils/pose_tracker.py", line 91, in run_posetracker staf_folder=staf_folder File "/content/VIBE/VIBE/lib/utils/pose_tracker.py", line 32, in run_openpose os.chdir(staf_folder) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/mkocabas/developments/openposetrack'
Please can you help? thanks a lot

		Pretty cool model, works reasonably well. I have run a couple of inferences on this video:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://youtu.be/xyo5gl5GLEI&gt;https://youtu.be/xyo5gl5GLEI&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Some artifacts but overall the quality is good I think.
