Operating system: ubuntu 18.04

When processing amass dataser, the error happened:

KeyError: 'poses is not a file in the archive'
I donnot know why this is happening. And in my amass folder, only the bodydata part of the amass dataset is included.
Hope someone can help me about this, thanks in advance

No I didnot find the solution. I skip CMU dataset and it worked, so I think something is wrong with the CMU dataset... If you find other better solution, please tell me as well, thanks.

		Hi,
Some sequences in CMU is formatted differently than the rest. Please pull my latest commit to avoid this issue. Thanks.
