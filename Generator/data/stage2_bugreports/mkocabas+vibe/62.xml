	<summary>256 x 144: CUDA out of memory. Switch to CPU?</summary>
	<description>
Running the demo with a 256 x 144 video, I'm getting an out of memory error:
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 16.00 MiB (GPU 0; 3.95 GiB total capacity; 2.49 GiB already allocated; 18.88 MiB free; 2.51 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch)
This is running on a 4gb 1050.
I can setup a 6gb 1060.
If need be, I can get things going on a 13gb 1080.
Are any of these large enough to run VIBE?
If not, how can I run it on the CPU?  Is 32gb enough?

		What is the batch size you use? Reducing it will linearly reduce the GPU memory usage (args
vibe_batch_size)

		That fixed it. Thank you!
