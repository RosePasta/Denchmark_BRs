	<summary>3D Convolutional Layers not included in __init__ files</summary>
	<description>
I am not able to import conv_3d and 3d pooling layers. When I checked the __ init __.py files for both the tflearn folder and the layers folder, I realized 3D layers aren't included in those files. Is this intentional? Are those layers ready to use?

		Yes they are working, we just forgot to add them into init file! If you want, you can make a pull request to add it, and I will merge it :) Or I will update the code later.
