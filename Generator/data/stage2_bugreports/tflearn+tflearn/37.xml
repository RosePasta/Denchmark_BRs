	<summary>WARNING:Passing a `GraphDef` to the SummaryWriter is deprecated. Pass a `Graph` object instead, such as `sess.graph`.</summary>
	<description>
When running an lstm_generator*.py and TensorFlow 0.8.
Guessing this an 0.8 issue and will go away once tflearn is upgraded but thought I would post it in case not.

		Yes, this is because GraphDef is deprecated in new TF version. We need to change SummaryWriter argument to a Graph instead of a GraphDef. This should be a quick fix, just have to be sure that TF 0.7  is still compatible with it.
