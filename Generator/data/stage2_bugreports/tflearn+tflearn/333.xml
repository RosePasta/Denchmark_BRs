	<summary>Temp workaround for tensorflow 0.7.0 relative path issue causes an issue when path is specified correctly</summary>
	<description>
This comment and corresponding code in trainer.py at lines 369-370 checks the file path for if it starts with / or ~ and otherwise prepends ./ . However, this means that if the file_name actually starts with ./ you end up with ././ . Is this still needed and if so I think this case needs to be handled.

		True, we can remove that check, TensorFlow 0.7 is too old now.
