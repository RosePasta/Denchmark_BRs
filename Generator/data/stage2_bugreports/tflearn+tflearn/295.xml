	<summary>cifar10.load_data(dirname="/tmp/data") does not work</summary>
	<description>
the command cifar10.load_data() does not work if I specify the dirname paramenter.
It downloads the data in the dirname directory but it extracts them in the current directory (regardless of dirname) and thus it does not work.
example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tflearn.datasets import cifar10
(Xtr, Ytr), (X_test, Y_test) = cifar10.load_data(dirname="/tmp/data")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Downloading CIFAR 10, Please wait...
('Succesfully downloaded', 'cifar-10-python.tar.gz', 170498071, 'bytes.')
File Extracted in Current Directory

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi, thanks for reporting that issue, it is fixed now, please reinstall TFLearn (bleeding edge version)

		you can just navigate to /tmp/ and unzip the file called data.tar.zip which will replace the /data/ file with a fixed one. This worked for me!
