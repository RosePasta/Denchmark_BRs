 My Nvidia driver crashes when I change the HU threshold too fast:

This is with a Quadro K2200.

		I think this was fixed yesterday, with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/smistad/FAST/commit/409671f8b2b117c3a260a4104023cca1574ea34c&gt;409671f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Did you use this patch?

		Hm, works fine here. See in commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/smistad/FAST/commit/409671f8b2b117c3a260a4104023cca1574ea34c&gt;409671f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, try to uncomment the line in the freeAll method in the mesh object starting with VertexBufferObjectAcceess. Does that fix the problem?

 That helps with the issue above, but when I go below a certain HU threshold (about -21) I get an access violation.
Also the driver just complete freezes whenever I try to change the smoothing at all.
Additionally, when I monitor GPU usage I see that my Quadro is at 90% utilization when running the simpleGUI example. Could this be just the card running out of memory?

		This example can use up your memory. But smoothing should work. I will have at look at it on my Nvidia+windows machine tomorrow

		Sounds good.
