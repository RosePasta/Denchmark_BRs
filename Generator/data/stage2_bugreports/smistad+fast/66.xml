	<summary>Building tensorflow in Debug mode does not work</summary>
	<description>
Either fix it, or give a warning when trying to build in debug mode.
On windows you will get the following when building tf_protos_cc:
1&gt;    Building Custom Rule C:/Users/Erik/workspace/FAST/build5/external/tensorflow/src/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/cmake/CMakeLists.txt
1&gt;    CMake does not need to re-run because C:\Users\Erik\workspace\FAST\build5\external\tensorflow\CMakeFiles\generate.stamp is up-to-date.
1&gt;    Running C++ protocol buffer compiler on tensorflow/core/debug/debug_service.proto
1&gt;    The system cannot find the path specified.
This is because it looks for protoc.exe in the folder C:/Users/Erik/workspace/FAST/build5/external/tensorflow/protobuf/src/protobuf/Release/protoc.exe and not in the Debug folder
