	<summary>Last frame flag not set in MovieStreamer</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
MovieStreamer does not set the last frame flag. The MovieStreamer should be changed to output the previous frame instead of the current frame, because we only know that the last frame has been received after it was sent.
