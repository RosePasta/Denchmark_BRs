	<summary>Unused variables in histogram matching</summary>
	<description>
In the hist_match of Convert_Masked.py, masked_source and masked_template are defined but not used. Therefore, the mask is never applied to the template image (including get_new_face). Is this behaviour intended?
Simply replacing masked_template = template * mask to template = template * mask in hist_match gives much better results, removing white spots commonly appearing on the face with -mh option.

		yeah seems like a bug. although mask  is used only for GAN convert and this bug shouldn't have any effect on other trainers. Which trainer did you tried it with?

		I made a mistake T_T.. I'm using Original trainer. Image sets used were different, please forget about

hist_match gives much better results

Should I close this issue? Maybe this would be accidentally helpful for GAN users.

		If there is a bug, it should be corrected. What do you think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bryanlyon&gt;@bryanlyon&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
