	<summary>Using hog and rotate produces wrong alignments</summary>
	<description>
Using hog to extract and using rotate on or own angle values produces alignfile with wrong information aka wrong location for the face in the convert process.
cnn method does not have this problem.
This can be seen as using convert without seamless mode, the overlay goes into a wrong place.

		Is this definitely not false positives? The extractor used should have no effect on how the alignments are produced.
There was a push committed today to fix a bug in rotate, so you may want to test again.

		This should be fixed in latest commit (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/commit/958493a64a317388301e8e8a71202b90e6af2f2e&gt;958493a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
