	<summary>Wrong Extraction with Rotation</summary>
	<description>
Extracted using cnn and rotation on -&gt; Converted result shows the mask is in the wrong location
I am no coding expert so I may be wrong but... could this be an issue with alignments??
I have tripled checked this with a clean repository of the most recent one with the supposed fix of rotation angle list parameter &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/pull/380&gt;#380&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which still showed this issue
I also tested with an older repository with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/pull/365&gt;#365&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/tree/67009d0315fd6aaa2386f4a21fb9ee6b89cc05f3&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

which seems to work fine
It's my first time writing an issue on github so I'm not sure if I'm supposed post this here
