	<summary>Don't reload models everytime `convert_one_image` is called</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Use the convert command to convert a directory. convert_one_image loads the model once.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Use the convert command to convert a directory. convert_one_image loads the model every time that it is called.

		I'm adding a Convert class which will load models on __init__
It will be in my branch until I do a PR, but feel free to have a look

		The class is in my PR as the Convert_Adjust.py plugin. However, I did not address the fact that the model is reloaded for each image.

 , let me know if you want to tackle this separately, or if you are ok with my  folder. If so I'll make it run so it can be integrated quickly
