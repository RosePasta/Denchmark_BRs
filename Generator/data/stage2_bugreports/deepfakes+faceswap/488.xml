Extract with dnn-lib on mac OS X 10.13.5 failed:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Failed to extract from image: NoneType is not iterable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1080, 8GB
CUDA: 9.1
Python: 3.6.5
Reason is NVML library is not supported on macOS, so GPUStats.initialize() in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/blob/master/lib/gpu_stats.py&gt;gpu_stats.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fail with pynvml.NVMLError_LibraryNotFound, self.handles = None, get_free() gets Exception: "NoneType is not iterable" when extracting with dlib-cnn, no face will be dectected.
Can we work around it?

		NVML is kind of integral to extract. It may be that we may have to add some kind of manual config for macOS, but unfortunately it's not a priority right now. I will look into it when I have a chance (or someone else can raise a PR).
In the meantime you can rollback to the last pre-nvml build (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/tree/f90cd92ec36a0860c58a75631f762069419149de&gt;https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/tree/f90cd92ec36a0860c58a75631f762069419149de&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
