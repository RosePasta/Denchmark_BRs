		We have not seen this issue before, and it really shouldn't happen (especially since it must have successfully snapshotted  4 times before.
Did you roll back to a previous backup/snapshot prior to hitting this error? This is the only way I can see that this might have occured?

Yes but around the 90k and up to the 124k I've had no problem

		Ok. Thanks for the feedback. I think I know why this happens then and will look to push a fix
