		They changed the structure with last update.
In version before command for docker install was :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;COPY ./requirements-python35.txt .
RUN pip3 --no-cache-dir install -r ./requirements-python35.txt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As there were different requirement-files they now have been bundled in a single file called "requirements.txt"
I would suggest to simply replace "requirements-docker.txt" with "requirements.txt" in the docker-file(s).

		Simplely updating the file name is enough to fix it.
Dont forget it while merging staging branch, which has not been fixed.
That dockerfile should work cos I even successfully built that on docker hub.
