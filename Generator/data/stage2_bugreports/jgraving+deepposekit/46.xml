	<summary>Updated imports break compatibility with older versions of tensorflow</summary>
	<description>
This does seem to break compatibility with tensorflow 1.12. Downgrading to 0.3.5 (before this pull request) seems to fix this.
It would be nice to have the imports change dynamically.

 Reopen if you're still having problems.
