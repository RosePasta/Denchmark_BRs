When trying to import deepposekit, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
File "C:\Users\benco\Anaconda3\envs\deepposekit\lib\site-packages\deepposekit_init_.py", line 20, in 
from deepposekit.io import TrainingGenerator, DataGenerator
File "C:\Users\benco\Anaconda3\envs\deepposekit\lib\site-packages\deepposekit\io_init_.py", line 25, in 
from deepposekit.io.video import *
File "C:\Users\benco\Anaconda3\envs\deepposekit\lib\site-packages\deepposekit\io\video.py", line 16, in 
from tensorflow.python.keras.utils import Sequence
ImportError: cannot import name 'Sequence'
As far as I can tell, TensorFlow 2.1.0 is installed fine. It's certainly able to find my GPU.
Thanks,
Ben

		This should already be fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/commit/b3bb5398b23358fd41e6fa9a38743874a2233775&gt;b3bb539&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Make sure you have the latest release of DPK installed

		I seem to have. 0.3.6? Reverting back to tensorflow 2.0.0 seems to have fixed the issue.

		I pushed the wrong version to pip. Should be fixed now.
