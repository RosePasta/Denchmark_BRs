	<summary>PyYAML dependency</summary>
	<description>
It appears like this code requires installation of the PyYAML package, but this is not properly listed in requirements.
After installing deep pose kit following instructions, importing the package results in the error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'
manually doing
pip install pyyaml
fixes this

		Thanks for pointing this out. If you want to submit a PR to update setup.py I'd appreciate it. Otherwise I'll add this later when I have time to push some updates.
