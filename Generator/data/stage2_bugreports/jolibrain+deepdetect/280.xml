&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Configuration&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Version of DeepDetect:

 Locally compiled on:

 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 Mac OSX
 Other:


 Docker
 Amazon AMI


Commit (shown by the server when starting): Whatever is the latest tag

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your question / the problem you're facing:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm a new user of DeepDetect and am trying to set it setup. I'm on an Azure machine running Ubuntu 16.04. I have done the following steps for the CPU version, as well as the GPU version of the Docker image.

docker pull beniz/deepdetect_cpu
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 beniz/deepdetect_cpu
docker ps (no containers running)
docker logs {container_id}

For the output of step 4, I get the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./dede: error while loading shared libraries: libcurlpp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It appears that this may be related to recent commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/commit/39bd4a0706cc61a03ed8361f096d946099eb0b02&gt;beniz@39bd4a0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which compiles  instead of using the  package.
Am I running the container incorrectly, or is this an issue with the newest version? I don't see any version tags so I'm unable to test on an older version from Docker Hub.
Thanks!

		Hi, thanks for reporting this. Updated containers have been rolled out, and they work fine for us, let me know if the issue does persist. We haven't looked into container versioning yet.

		Much appreciated &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz&gt;@beniz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I just pulled the latest version and things are working smoothly. Looks like your fix did the trick.
