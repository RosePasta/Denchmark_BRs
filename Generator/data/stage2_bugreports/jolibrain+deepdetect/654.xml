	<summary>RefineDet fails with `nclasses`=3</summary>
	<description>
Issue: refinedet_512 caffe template fails when nclasses=3. I can't find the source of the issue in the parameter automatic scaling in caffelib.cc. I guess it thus might be in Caffe itself.
Workaround: use nclasses=4 and ignore class number 3.

		issue come from some cudnn curse. workaround is to set  params.mllib.engine either to: CUDNN_SINGLE_HANDLE , CUDNN_MIN_MEMORY of CAFFE (no cudnn)
[ CUDNN fails, and so does DEFAULT, which is same as CUDNN when caffe is compiled with cudnn ]
