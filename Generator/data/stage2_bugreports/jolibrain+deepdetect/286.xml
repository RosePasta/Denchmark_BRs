	<summary>OpenImages TF model update to use a sigmoid instead of softmax layer</summary>
	<description>
Based on a long series of discussion with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz&gt;@beniz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I managed to produce a  model file based on the original OpenImages Inception v3 model that works with DeepDetect and outputs confidences from a sigmoid layer (as the original model used) rather than a softmax.
A lot of info was inspired by this comment: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openimages/dataset/issues/21#issuecomment-276107322&gt;openimages/dataset#21 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and other helpful information from: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openimages/dataset/issues/3#issuecomment-259552328&gt;openimages/dataset#3 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

A very rough how-to is available here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/cchadowitz-pf/f1c3e781c125813f9976f6e69c06fec2&gt;https://gist.github.com/cchadowitz-pf/f1c3e781c125813f9976f6e69c06fec2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thank you, I've checked the model and it appears to work very nicely. Model link has been updated.
