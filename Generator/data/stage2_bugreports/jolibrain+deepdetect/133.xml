Hi,
I keep getting this error when trying to setup CSV training:
[libprotobuf FATAL /usr/include/google/protobuf/repeated_field.h:625] CHECK failed: (index) &lt; (size()):
Full Error:
ERROR - 16:17:33 - service regserv training call failed

CSV columns:

Please could someone help me, I am new to deep detect.
Kind Regards,

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jthrelfall777&gt;@jthrelfall777&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 please state your platform, whether you are following the &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.deepdetect.com/tutorials/csv-training/&gt;CSV training tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or using your own data, and in the latter case, what your  and  calls are. Also, in your model repository should be  files, and it is useful to share these as well in gist for instance. Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz&gt;@beniz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for your quick reply. I have got a gist with everything in. No this is my own data I made up. The data is dummy data to test setting deepdetect up before looking at potential uses for it.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/jthrelfall777/f28a5475e95a4a6b1fa22ed9330e7926&gt;https://gist.github.com/jthrelfall777/f28a5475e95a4a6b1fa22ed9330e7926&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Kind Regards

 thanks for the thorough report. It looks like a bug in our regression model template generator, that may confuse the protobuf reader.
To test this hypothesis, could you try to remove one of the  statements at line &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/jthrelfall777/f28a5475e95a4a6b1fa22ed9330e7926#file-output-txt-L273&gt;https://gist.github.com/jthrelfall777/f28a5475e95a4a6b1fa22ed9330e7926#file-output-txt-L273&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ? And then rerun your  without the  line. Then issue the  call.
Please let me know how this goes.

 Thanks that fixed that problem. Got a new one now. I am not sure if it's related so I included the output for you.

		Great, let me clear the first one as it may affect the second one.

 thanks again for the thorough report, such a good example of a well-informed issue that can be tackled quickly!
The commit above fixes the original problem and another one I quickly found after that. Running your original commands should go through fine, at least it does on my side.

Not sure if related, but yes the original issue has gone.
Kind Regards.

		Is this with the original data and script you shared ?

		Ok really sorry, it's been a long day. I was running the wrong dataset. It works perfectly now. Thank you so much for your help.
