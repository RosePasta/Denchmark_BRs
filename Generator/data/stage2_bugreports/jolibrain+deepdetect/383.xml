	<summary>crash when `remain_time` is not available</summary>
	<description>
Last version of DeepDetect with ETA features stopped working in my pipeline. There's an issue when I try to create LMDB file and in the same time make call to get stats for training. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/YaYaB&gt;@YaYaB&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has more information about that and quick fix ;)
Cheers

		One of the measures in output is not a float anymore, and you may have to adapt to this (we did on our side).

 Thanks for the latest feature with Estimated Time, it's really nice. However when I try to run a training it fails and returns the following error:

It's due to the fact that DD tries to compute estimated remain time each time it collects measures (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/blob/2306677f720ead4872ae7e5b158021b1536c0553/src/mlservice.h&gt;https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/blob/2306677f720ead4872ae7e5b158021b1536c0553/src/mlservice.h&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 line 257). It needs the measure   however it's not always computed. At the very beginning of the training it does not appear.
