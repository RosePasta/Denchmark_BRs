DeepDetect [ commit ab7bae2b9a0b994efeb95be4aa836385beccd6f8 ]
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Problem :&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The None, Null, N/A values in request to DeepDetect could affect it's training. I think that it's good practice to use default value or accept None when it's provided.
In example below DeepDetect are core dumping when stepsize set to null.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Error message (if any) / steps to reproduce the problem:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Hello, that's a good question. At the moment, the rational behind the server is that an unused parameter should be unset (i.e. not appear). The fact that the server can be killed remotely by giving null values qualifies as a bug, and ignoring the null values would be a solution. Thanks for catching this!

		From looking at DD internals, null values are already ignored (i.e. removed). I believe the issue comes from specifying "lr_policy": "step" while setting stepsize and gamma to null. Could you retry your initial example with a non-null stepsize and gamma and report whether the crash still occurs ? Thanks.

		Yes we had investigated in this issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/YaYaB&gt;@YaYaB&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , looks like a caffe had some difficulties of raising an error if some parameters are not correctly set. I will try what you suggested and will come back to you

		Indeed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz&gt;@beniz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I created a pull request in Caffe's repository.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/6104&gt;BVLC/caffe#6104&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Basically in DD you catch the log FATAL of Caffe and raise an error instead of core dump. I found that they do not raise a log FATAL in case of updating the learning rate in sgd_solver.cpp so I added it in the code using the CHECK method.
I tested it using DeepDetect build on a Caffe with my modifications and it works well. An error is sent to the user, no more core dump.

		Checked with setted params stepsize and gamma, works fine without core dump

		Yep, basically it comes from this very specific line:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/536851c00e44d545649648b372503f52a89c0499/src/caffe/solvers/sgd_solver.cpp#L33&gt;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/536851c00e44d545649648b372503f52a89c0499/src/caffe/solvers/sgd_solver.cpp#L33&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Here they divide by  that when not specified seem to be initialized to 0, thus create core dump

		This has been merged into our custom Caffe, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jolibrain/caffe/commit/ee7247f5c64d732b7b3e4cad1146dc025f700997&gt;jolibrain/caffe@ee7247f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
