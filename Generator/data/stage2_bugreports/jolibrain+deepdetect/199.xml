I got that response always when querying from the browser (for instance, localhost:8823/info) or the demo imgdetect (on the ajax query).
However, a curl -x works just fine.

		OTOH, the errors message runs just fine:
{
status: {
code: 404,
msg: "NotFound"
}
}

		...and it seems that the headers are right. Really weird.

		Definitely is related with the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/pull/180&gt;PR 180&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. On browsers on which I cannot disable the gzip accept encoding, i got that error. However, on firefox, works like a charm after disabling gzip.

		Commenting the blocks starting &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/blob/master/src/httpjsonapi.cc#L190&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/beniz/deepdetect/blob/master/src/httpjsonapi.cc#L202&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and thus disabling the gzip encoding, solved the error. Obviously, not the solution, but it works now.
