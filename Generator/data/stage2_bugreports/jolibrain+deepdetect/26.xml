	<summary>Default `localhost` does not seem to bind properly in some settings / "ERROR - empty resource"</summary>
	<description>
Typically, starting dede defaults on localhost:8080 and in some cases querying localhost from API returns nothing. Switching to 127.0.0.1 clears the problem.
This issue in case it is a possibility that the binding issue comes from deepdetect embedded web server (based on boost).

 start server with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./dede -host 127.0.0.1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Still not sure where the problem comes from.

		Some progress... this is due to ipv6 binding on localhost. Typically, commenting out:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;::1 localhost
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

in /etc/hosts fixes the issue.
Still looking for better fix.

		More analysis reveals that this is very likely to be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib/pull/448&gt;cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib#448&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib/issues/447&gt;cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib#447&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for versions of cpp-netlib prior to 0.11.1. Ubuntu 14.04, which is the supported platform for dd, appears to ship with 0.11.0. In the meantime I'll commit a quick fix internal to dd that clears the issue for  binding to  as .
