	<summary>Python client post_train needs service name as lowercase</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I was trying to create and train a service with python and the following happened:
put_service works
get_service works but shows name in lowercase
post_train fails with service not found unless I lowercase the service name. Once I lowercase the service name, it works fine.
Couldn't find anything in the documentation relating to service names should be lowercase. But not sure if should always be.
Thanks,
Isaac

		Good catch, thanks! The service name is automatically turned into lowercase, which is common practice in REST API because URLs are themselves case-insensitive, so lowercase becomes the default. Commit above fixes the issue, which was server-side.
