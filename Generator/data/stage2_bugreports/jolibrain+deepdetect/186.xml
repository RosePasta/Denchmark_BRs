	<summary>Error building docker cpu image (boost package changed)</summary>
	<description>
Looks like something has changed in boost library and so deepdetect can no longer be built when running docker build . from deepdetect/docker/cpu
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:1131 (message):
  Unable to find the requested Boost libraries.

  Boost version: 1.54.0

  Boost include path: /usr/include

  Could not find the following Boost libraries:

          boost_iostreams

  Some (but not all) of the required Boost libraries were found.  You may
  need to install these additional Boost libraries.  Alternatively, set
  BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the directory containing Boost libraries or BOOST_ROOT
  to the location of Boost.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:53 (find_package)


&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thanks for spotting this one. Fixed by commit above, due to new &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jolibrain/deepdetect/issues/176&gt;#176&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
