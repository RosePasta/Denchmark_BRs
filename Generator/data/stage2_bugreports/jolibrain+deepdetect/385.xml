I am using docker beniz/deepdetect_cpu image on windows 10. Able to run process and add image classifier to it. While making a predict request getting following error:
{
"status": {
"code": 500,
"msg": "InternalError",
"dd_code": 1007,
"dd_msg": "src/caffe/util/io.cpp:67 / Check failed (custom): (fd) != (-1)"
}
}
Please check attached screenshots.

		Most likely the container is not finding the /opt directory. If it is on the host, make sure you are sharing the volume with the docker container

		Found the culprit: this is due to ResNet_mean.binaryproto that needs to be renamed mean.binaryproto. We'll rebuild &amp; test again before confirmation.
Thanks for reporting this!

		This is now fixed if you use beniz/deepdetect_cpu. All other docker builds will follow as the builds unfold. I'll post and close the issue when all builds are complete.
