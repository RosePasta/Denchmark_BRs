	<summary>CPU Docker XGBoost Error</summary>

In trying to build the CPU Docker image, I encounter the following error in step 19/25: RUN cmake .. -DUSE_XGBOOST=ON

Let me know if you need any more details, hopefully I'm not missing something obvious here. Thanks for such a great library.

		Thanks for catching this one. This appears to be from XGBoost itself, and the fix above for DD should do the trick.
As a side-note and FTR, GPU support for XGBoost appears to be broken similarly to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/2390&gt;dmlc/xgboost#2390&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks, worked like a charm!

		Xgboost has fixed its GPU build by merging &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/2390&gt;dmlc/xgboost#2390&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and DD build is now fixed as well. Closing.
