	<summary>CoverTree fails when only 1 element is indexed</summary>
	<description>
In the extreme case, when there is only one element indexed, the covertree fails
This line in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/haifengl/smile/blob/master/core/src/main/java/smile/neighbor/CoverTree.java#L519&gt;CoverTree.java#L519&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just returns an empty array
I think the fix would be to add the root to the created index, before returning
a1[0] = n1;
