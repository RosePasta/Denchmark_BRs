	<summary>Lasso can get stuck in NaN state</summary>
	<description>
I tried running LASSO with lambda values of 1.0 and 0.001 with the dataset posted in another recent bug report.
Occasionally LASSO reports NaN values, and then gets stuck there (since it can't evaluate the stopping criteria).
Here is an example from a single run -- the learner seems to restart at some point, and gets stuck at NaN. (Sometimes it will randomly start in that state.)
I have removed the zero columns from the dataset.

		Each iteration needs to call BCG, which is an iterative algorithm too. It is not a restart. I tried on both data you provided with master code. I have not observed this problem yet. Will keep trying.

		Did you see my comments on SparseMatrix with Lasso in another thread? It is a lot faster.

		Cannot replicate this issue with Oracle JDK and latest code. Will keep an eye on this if it happens. Thanks!
