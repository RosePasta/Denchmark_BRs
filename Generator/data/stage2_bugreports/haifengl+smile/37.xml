	<summary>NLP initialisation breaks  on new SimpleCorpus</summary>
	<description>
When I start a new project, and include smile (including NLP) from Maven.
Simply running the following code gives an initialization exception:
new SimpleCorpus();
The library seems to be missing the dictionary files.
Stacktrace:

		Sorry for the issue. I have published SmileNLP 1.0.4 with resource files included. It works with my test app. Please have a try. Thanks!

  no problem, I can't seem to find the SmileNLP 1.0.4 on Maven, do you have a download link for me?

		My test app uses sbt:
libraryDependencies += "com.github.haifengl" % "smile-nlp" % "1.0.4"
Can you try it later? Maybe the central repo takes some time to publish it. Thanks!
