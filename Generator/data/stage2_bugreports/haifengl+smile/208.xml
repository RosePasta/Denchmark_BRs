	<summary>SentenceSplitter deletes sentence on short abbreviations</summary>
	<description>
The SimpleSentenceSplitter seems to delete sentences that end with a short abbreviation. In particular with abbreviations that end in a consonant.
See example below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import smile.nlp.tokenizer.SimpleSentenceSplitter

val sss = SimpleSentenceSplitter.getInstance()

sss.split("This is an nn. This is the next sentence.") // Array(This is the next sentence.)
sss.split("This is an nn. this is the next sentence.") // Array(This is an nn. this is the next sentence.)
sss.split("This is an na. This is the next sentence.") // Array(This is an na., This is the next sentence.)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Case 1 is a bug, which I fixed now. Case 2 is not really a bug as we expect a sentence starting with capital. It is not perfect but a reasonable requirement for a rule-base system. Case 3 works because na is not an abbreviations in our dictionary.

		Thanks! I added Case 2 and 3 just to show that in these cases the first sentence is not deleted.

		BTW, after the fix, the first case will still return only one sentence (but the whole string), which is expected by the rules.
