Hi there,
The constructor RandomForest(Attribute[] attributes, double[][] x, int[] y, int ntrees, int maxNodes, int nodeSize, int mtry, double subsample) allows the user to specify maxNodes and nodeSize, but then goes on to make a chained call with maxNodes = 100 and nodeSize = 5. I wondered whether that was intentional because it seems to be somewhat misleading.
