	<summary>Accessing weights and model parameters/too many values to unpack</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When I try to run the following:
You can use an estimator and call train_model in order to get access to the netword structure and parameters. train_model is an instance of DeepARTrainingNetwork, which in turn is derived from DeepARNetwork, which itself is derived from mxnet.gluon.block.HybridBlock. The following code demonstrates how to lookup the objects lineage.
train_transformation, train_model = deepar_estimator.train_model(training_data)
(after gluonts.model.deepar._network.DeepARTrainingNetwork.bases[0].bases[0])
I get the following error message:
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Error Message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
 in 
----&gt; 1 train_transformation, train_model = deepar_estimator.train_model(training_data)
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
I used 2 personal datasets (within 2000 data point each), changed train/test limits, but I always see this error.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/antonkiselevtdg&gt;@antonkiselevtdg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we changed the output of train_model to a class TrainOutput which is why this snipplet does not work anymore. The following should work:
train_output = deepar_estimator.train_model(training_data) print(train_output.transformation) print(train_output.trained_net)
