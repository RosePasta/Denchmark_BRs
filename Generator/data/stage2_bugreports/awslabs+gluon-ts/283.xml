	<summary>The calculation of dataset statistics reads wrong feature fields</summary>
	<description>
Given a dataset ds that includes features, ds.calc_stats() searches for cat and dynamic_feat to compute feature statistics, which are outdated fields. This always givas as ouput cats=[] and num_dymanic_feat=0.
