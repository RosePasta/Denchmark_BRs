	<summary>Produce Json-compliant results in serve (Nan)</summary>
	<description>
When the forecast contain NaN values, Python's json library encodes this as Nan and not as a the string "Nan". This is not compliant to the json spec and some parsers don't know how to handle these values.

		Good question, but I didn't want to rule it out generally.
With that said, ETS seems to produce NaN results under some circumstances, so I at least want to give algorithms the option to emit these.
