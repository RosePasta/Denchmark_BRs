	<summary>time_feature for Easter raised error for target date on 2018-10-06</summary>
	<description>
I encountered error message "ssertionError: No closest holiday for the date index 2018-10-06 00:00:00 found." when creating time feature for holidays. The current setting MAX_WINDOW = 183 + 4 failed for Easter Sunday with target date index on 2018-10-06. And here is the source code I am looking at: src/gluonts/time_feature/holiday.py.

		Thanks for reporting this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Xiaolu-Zhu&gt;@Xiaolu-Zhu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The  is too short, as the earliest possible date for eastern is March, 22 and the last possible date is April, 25.  should work for eternity.

		This is now fixed on the master branch and will be part of the next GluonTS release (0.6.0).
