	<summary>Can't load a serialized predictor and utilize the GPU</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I trained a model with , and saved the resulting . Using directions from the documentation, I get the error described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/issues/213&gt;#213&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If I run the code mentioned in the above issue, the predictor loads, but only predicts using the CPU. Setting ctx='gpu' in the code below results in the same error, and therefore I'm unable to save a trained model and load it back while being able to retain the ability to predict with the GPU.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;predictor = RepresentableBlockPredictor.deserialize(Path("models/"))
predictor.ctx = mx.Context('cpu')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Same as described here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/issues/213&gt;#213&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Error Message&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

RuntimeError: Parameter 'deeparpredictionnetwork0_featureembedder0_cat_0_embedding_weight' was not initialized on context gpu(0). It was only initialized on [cpu(0)].
Any thoughts on being able to save out a predictor object, and load it back in and still be able to utilize GPU acceleration for inference?

		Can you try
with mx.Context(mx.gpu(0)):
    predictor = Predictor.deserialize(Path(model_dir))

		This works - INFO:root:Using GPU when the model is loaded, and it looks like it is using the GPU for predictions. Thank you!

		Closing since this was also properly addressed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/pull/318&gt;#318&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
