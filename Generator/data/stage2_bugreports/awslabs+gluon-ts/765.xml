	<summary>LSTNet's scaling</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The scaling in LSTNet is only valid for NTC tensors however we are feeding it NCT tensors since output_NTC=False and thus are not using the scaled values.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kashif&gt;@kashif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, youâ€™re right. I think this requires having an  option in scaler blocks, what do you think?

Hey thanks for that, it would be best to have two separate PRs I think
