	<summary>pandas-offsets stopped being hashable</summary>
	<description>
In Pandas 1.1 the freq component of the time-stamps that we use have stopped being hashable, which means, they cannot be used as keys in dictionaries. We use this in different locations in our code base.
We now have two options:

open an issue with pandas, requesting that the old behaviour is restored
change our code to not make use of this feauture

		For now we should probably change the pandas requirement to &lt;1.1.
I also ran into problems with the pandas version.
