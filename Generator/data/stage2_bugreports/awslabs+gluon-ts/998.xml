	<summary>DeepAR on Solar Energy dataset gives NRMSE &amp;gt; 1</summary>
	<description>
after training for 40 epochs, DeepAR model still gives me NRMSE of about 1.03 although ND is reasonable (about 0.51). Why is NRMSE &gt; 1? Possible bug?
Compared the results with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/blob/master/evaluations/solar-energy/DeepAREstimator.json&gt;https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/blob/master/evaluations/solar-energy/DeepAREstimator.json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it matches, but NRMSE isn't provided.
This only happens on solar energy dataset specifically.

		I am not 100% sure but a possible explanation could be that DeepAR produces non-zero forecast during night whereas the target is almost zero causing large errors.

		Ah that makes sense; looks like there can be some huge outliers in the prediction. thanks!
