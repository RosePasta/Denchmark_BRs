	<summary>can you train a model with less input size than output? if prediction length is much larger than input length?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have time series data where the problem is characteristically defined with a very short input length and compartively much largert output/target/prediction length.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

train_ds = ListDataset([
    {
        FieldName.TARGET: target,
        FieldName.START: start,
        FieldName.FEAT_DYNAMIC_REAL: fdr,
        FieldName.FEAT_STATIC_CAT: fsc
    }
    for (target, start, fdr, fsc) in zip(data_train,
                                         dates_train,
                                         train_covariates,
                                         stat_features_train)
], freq="D")

estimator = DeepAREstimator(
    prediction_length=prediction_length,
    freq="D",
    distr_output = NegativeBinomialOutput(),
    use_feat_dynamic_real=True,
    use_feat_static_cat=True,
    cardinality=stat_feature_cardinalities,
    trainer=Trainer(
        learning_rate=1e-3,
        epochs=100,
        num_batches_per_epoch=50,
        batch_size=32
    )
)

predictor = estimator.train(train_ds)
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Error message or code output&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Exception: Reached maximum number of idle transformation calls.
This means the transformation looped over GLUONTS_MAX_IDLE_TRANSFORMS=100 inputs without returning any output.
This occurred in the following transformation:
gluonts.transform.split.InstanceSplitter(dummy_value=0.0, forecast_start_field="forecast_start", future_length=43, is_pad_field="is_pad", lead_time=0, output_NTC=True, past_length=1136, pick_incomplete=True, start_field="start", target_field="target", time_series_fields=["time_feat", "observed_values"], train_sampler=gluonts.transform.sampler.ExpectedNumInstanceSampler(num_instances=1.0))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/super-shayan&gt;@super-shayan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
what do you mean by input length? The training data needs to contain time series which have at least the length .
Please also have a look at: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/issues/1076&gt;#1076&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		that makes it unusable to me unfortunately, since by problem characteristic i have very short time series that need to be forecasted for comparitively much longer horizon ahead
