	<summary>Old models will likely not be deserializable</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The recently merged &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/pull/582&gt;#582&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will probably prevent previously serialized model from being loadable, since a json file is missing. This is something that we could probably avoid breaking in the next release, so I'm making this 0.5 blocking.
We probably also want to add tests for this.
