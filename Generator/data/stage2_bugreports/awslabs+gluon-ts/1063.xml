&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Some tests started to fail pretty frequently on Windows, see e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/pull/1061/checks?check_run_id=1181936080&gt;logs from this run&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
It appears to be some issue with processes trying to access the same files, so it looks like it's related to the data loader.
