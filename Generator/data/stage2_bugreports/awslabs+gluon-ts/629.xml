	<summary>NBeats network shares wrong parameters between blocks in sharing mode.</summary>
	<description>
Setting NBeats estimator to generic mode with default parameters except for:
num_blocks=[4] and sharing=True
Getting model to train produces such error:
 AssertionError: Cannot retrieve Parameter 'nbeatstrainingnetwork8_nbeatsgenericblock58_dense5_weight' because desired attribute does not match with stored for attribute 'shape': desired '(7, 0)' vs stored '(28, 0)'.
I can provide whole error if needed but it was quite long and I think described issue clearly below.
My forcast horizon is set to 7 timesteps as you can see and backcast is set to 4 * forecast.
I've tracked the problem and it is simply because of naming convention for layers while copying them.
It is produced by lines &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts/blob/167772820d87f7481a2305691678741d67d9326e/src/gluonts/model/n_beats/_network.py#L445&gt;445-449&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from _network.py and following creation of NBEATSBlocks.
With the current naming convention of layers wrong parameters are trying to be shared with the last block.
With default parameters each block has 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers, theta_backcast layer, backcast layer, theta_forecast layer and forecast layer resulting in this example in 8 layers. Layers are named "dense[0:7]". But the last block has only 6 layers because there are no theta_backcast layer and backcast layer .
While copying parameters gluon is looking at the name of the parameter so in the case of 5th layer from last block (theta_forecast layer) it is trying to copy parameter from 5th layer from previous block which is in this case a theta_backcast layer.
Copying parameters by name happens in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/bdd34e97bab787597dafaa349d05ea7e96deda8a/python/mxnet/gluon/block.py#L55&gt;_BlockScope&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 class create method from block.py file in gluon package.

  can you take a look?
