	<summary>Smoothing displays double lines; does not change line opacity</summary>
	<description>

Weights and Biases version: 0.8.9
Python version: 3.5.3
Operating System: Linux-4.9.0-9-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-9.9

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

On my run page, my smoothed plots show up as double lines because wandb doesn't change the opacity of the original lines. Only happens on run page, project page smoothing works as expected. Example:

		It's a private project. Is there a way I could add only you as a member to the run/project?

		Thanks for reporting this. I was able to reproduce and have a PR out to fix it. Should hopefully be gone by tomorrow!
