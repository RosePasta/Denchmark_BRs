	<summary>wandb.restore doesn't respect root argument</summary>
	<description>
The root argument for wandb.restore is described as follows:

The directory to download the file to.  Defaults to the current directory or the run directory if wandb.init was called.

However when wandb.init has been called, it always uses the run directory, so the root argument has no effect.
