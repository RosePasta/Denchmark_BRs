	<summary>`wandb.watch(model)` is not logging gradients.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The title is pretty much the issue, but when I call wandb.watch(model) after instantiating my model the gradients are not showing up on my dashboard.
I've successfully used wandb.watch with other models, and its this particular case that seems to be the problem, so I'm pretty sure this isn't exactly a "bug," but I believe that I'm misunderstanding how watching models should behave and would appreciate it if anyone more knowledgeable than me could help.

Line &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/147&gt;#147&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/seanswyi/transformer-implementation/blob/main/src/main.py&gt;this file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is where I call  after instantiating my model and putting it on the GPU device.

		My apologies. For some reason the code I was actually running locally had this commented out. I'll close the Issue.
