	<summary>"null" not working when filtering the runs</summary>
	<description>
This issue is related to W&amp;B UI.
When some config option is logged as null (or none in python), the table filtering does not work with it properly. For example, no matter what filter you set on that property, you won't be able to see the runs with "null" value of that config option.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/umgupta&gt;@umgupta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this should be supported.  Can you link us to a project where you're unable to do this currently?  Are the values actual null values or the string "null"?

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/umgupta&gt;@umgupta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the past few months we've majorly reworked the CLI and UI for Weights &amp; Biases. We're closing stale issues. Please comment to reopen.
