	<summary>Setting init directory still creates wandb folder on init</summary>
	<description>
System:

OS: MacOS 10.15.5
Python: 3.8.5
wandb: 0.10.5

Steps to reproduce:

Initialise a project from a python file with a changed root directory like so:

wandb.init(project="my-project", dir="results")
A wandb folder will still be created at the top level of the project despite the changed directory.
As a side note, a wandb folder is also created inside the results folder. It is likely this is intended, but it would be nice have an option to turn this off as I like to place my results in a hidden folder .wandb, since linting tools such as isort rely on top-level directories to determine which packages are part of a project and which are third-party packages. Using the default wandb directory causes these tools to recognise wandb as part of the project instead of a third party tool.
