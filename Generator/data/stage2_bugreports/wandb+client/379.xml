	<summary>OSError: [Errno 49] Can't assign requested address</summary>
	<description>
I just tried upgrading 0.7.3 to 0.8.1 and my runs are failing with error below. Downgrading back to 0.7.3 fixes the problem
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):

		That's no good.  We switched to localhost instead of the 0.0.0.0 to prevent firewall warnings.  It's working fine for me on OSX, I'll look into the root cause, but I can get a quick fix out that falls back to 0.0.0.0.

		Actually, can you run cat /etc/hosts and tell me if there's an entry for localhost there?  Mine looks like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1	localhost
255.255.255.255	broadcasthost
::1             localhost
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Did not have that entry (my jobs overwrite my /etc/hosts to give AWS machines human-readable DNS names), I guess I need to keep localhost in there

		Yeah, that will fix it.  I'll make sure our code falls back to 127.0.0.1 in this case though.
