	<summary>(Web Interface) Aggregation of bar chart does not work</summary>
	<description>
hi, there:
I found that the aggregation option of bar chart seems not work for me. Below is a screenshot
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2403596/97018943-a2048a80-1547-11eb-972d-003d506036e3.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Changing Agg to mean/min/max does not make any difference. I guess wandb is only loading the metric from the final step. But in some cases (my previous plots weeks ago), the option worked, i.e., doing aggregation across steps.
I do have the metric from different runs, and the line plot is working properly, see below

Thanks!

		Hi there, it looks like grouping isn't on for these bar charts. The aggregation works across summary metrics, so summary values from multiple different runs. It doesn't work for aggregating values across a time series for a metric from a single run. Is that what you were expecting?

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cvphelps&gt;@cvphelps&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Thanks for the response!
Yes, I'm expecting aggregating across a time series from a single run. Is there anyway I can do this? I guess it would be  a common function that we need to select a best step/checkpoint from a single run.

		I figured it out that I need to write the info using wandb.run.summary.
