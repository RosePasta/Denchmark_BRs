	<summary>Plotly conversion fails for multiple subplots</summary>

wandb --version &amp;&amp; python --version &amp;&amp; uname

Python version: 3.6.5
Operating System: Linux

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I export a number of figures at the end of training showing a variety of metrics by threshold, etc. I tried doing this with the standard logging syntax but I found that most plots that were complicated resulted in plotly UserWarnings indicating that it does not know how to handle them. Plotly version 3.6.1. I found this specifically with a precision and recall figure that contained two subplots, there were other errors but I didn't track them. Is there a way to handle this or would I need to convert my plotting to Plotly to avoid the conversion step?
I tried switching to exporting them as images but I found the space provided on the run page for media is too small to see each plot.

		Im having the same problem. Wandb makes some mistakes when converting from matplotlib to plotly. For example the subplot titles are missing.

		Currently there are 3 options if matplotlib to plotly conversion isn't working for you.

User our new custom charts functionality:
https://docs.wandb.com/library/log#custom-charts
https://docs.wandb.com/app/features/custom-charts/walkthrough
Convert your plots to Plotly charts explicitly and log them with wandb.Plotly.
Convert the matplotlib objects to images with wandb.Image(figure_or_plot)

Plotly has deprecated their official matplotlib to plotly conversion logic.  We may release a custom matplotlib conversion library in the future.  Our custom charting logic is using the same underlying engine as &lt;denchmark-link:https://altair-viz.github.io/&gt;Altair&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so we may have a deeper integration with altair in the future as well.
