	<summary>fastai2 integration</summary>
	<description>

The integration with fastai was moved to fastai with fastai2. Nevertheless, I'd aprecciate if you could have a look at the implementation, because currently it's broken. You introduce a breaking change in your API by increasing the step counter with every log call (now one needs to explicitly turn  off, in order to have the original behaviour). I tried to fix this over in fastai with the following PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/3067&gt;fastai/fastai#3067&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yet, something is still off and I'd appreciate your help in debugging/fixing.
I train my model for 5 epochs, and this is the accuracy plot in wandb:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31695/101783119-27dd9480-3afa-11eb-8cbe-46f016e78291.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And this is the fastai training output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;epoch     train_loss  valid_loss  accuracy  b_score  ece       nll       err  time    
0         7.291822    6.423790    0.891155  0.022018     0.056384  6.423790  0.122854           05:19    
1         6.633485    6.526669    0.906586  0.019923     0.055146  6.526669  0.132975           05:17     
2         7.929371    7.037761    0.877101  0.028144     0.071046  7.037761  0.144133           05:17     
3         6.300512    6.006740    0.909066  0.017325     0.049415  6.006740  0.115119           05:17   
4         5.873019    5.817275    0.922017  0.015450     0.049534  5.817275  0.111537           05:17      
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The wandb plot in numbers:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;epoch 
0     0.8912
1     0.9066
2     0.8771
3     0.9091
4     0.01545
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So something is broken in the last epoch.
wandb, version 0.10.11
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python3 -c "import fastai; import torch; import fastcore; print(torch.__version__, fastai.__version__, fastcore.__version__)"
1.7.0+cu110 2.1.8 1.3.9
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dreamflasher&gt;@dreamflasher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Do you have any reproducible code you could share so that we can see the issue?
Providing the step explicitly ensures we associate validation and training data to the correct step.

		Let's close this issue in favor of the one over at fastai.
