	<summary>Web App AutoViz creates New Names based on time &amp; hostname</summary>
	<description>
wandb --version &amp;&amp; python --version &amp;&amp; uname

Weights and Biases version: 0.8.14
Python version: 3.7.5
Operating System: Linux

The auto viz tool on the web app is making a new chart each time with date &amp; hostname, &amp; isn't plotting on the same section.
Also, if multiple sections are open, I'm unable to scroll down on the webpage.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tshrjn&gt;@tshrjn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, how are you logging your metrics?  Those metrics names are defined by the keys in your calls to .  Are you calling wandb.log manually or using a callback?

		Using sync_tensorboard at init and logging via torch.utils.tensorboard.
It was because of import order, import wandb before torch resolved it.

		Good to know, I think it was namespacing your runs by the logdir which had a date in it.  When you change the order are you still seeing all the metrics you're logging to tboard?
