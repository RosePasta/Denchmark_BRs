	<summary>wandb.restore not respecting run_path</summary>
	<description>

Weights and Biases version: 0.10.1
Python version: 3.7.7
Operating System: Linux-3.10.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to restore a previously trained model from a different run by specifying the run_path. But it still seems to be ignoring it and searching in the current run's folder.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What I Did&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; load_path = wandb.restore("best_model.th", run_path="rahular/nlp/o9yf2jxr")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/home/wjv316/anaconda3/envs/pos-bert/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_run.py", line 855, in restore
    raise ValueError("File {} not found.".format(path))
ValueError: File wandb/run-20200918_164521-1n2653n1/files/best_model.th not found.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rahular&gt;@rahular&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it looks like the run in question used wandb version 0.10.1, so the file isn't saved to . It could be saved to your next run which seems to be have been run in parallel, but it will exist on your machine in the  directory, under your project.
You did find an issue in our messaging for cases where restoring a file failed. Thank you for that, and good luck.
