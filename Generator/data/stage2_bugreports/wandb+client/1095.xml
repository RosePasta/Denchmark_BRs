	<summary>Permission denied on wandb.init()</summary>

wandb --version &amp;&amp; python --version &amp;&amp; uname

Operating System: Linux

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to use wandb on a computing cluster.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What I Did&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I use this small script to see if I can login and log some arbitrary values.
Since I am unable to do wandb login, I am setting the api key.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = '&lt;my_key&gt;'
os.environ['WANDB_MODE'] = 'dryrun'
os.environ['WANDB_ENTITY'] = '&lt;my_wandb_name&gt;'
os.environ['WANDB_PROJECT'] = 'cluster_test'
os.environ['WANDB_CONFIG_DIR'] = '/home/wallat/.config/wandb/'

wandb.init(dir='/home/wallat/wandb_mnist_test/')
wandb.log({'epoch': 2, 'loss': 0.5})
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is the output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/wallat/wandb_mnist_test/test_wandb.py", line 23, in &lt;module&gt;

    headless_args)], env=environ, **popen_kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 775, in __init__
    restore_signals, start_new_session)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 1522, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception_type(errno_num, err_msg, err_filename)
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ''
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can anyone tell me what might cause this problem? The error message is not quite enough to guess :)
Thanks

		This looks like a file system permission error.  Are you sure /home/wallat/wandb_mnist_test/ exists and is writeble by the user you're running the script as?

		There are likely more details in wandb/debug.log

		Yes, it should not be an permission problem. Every run creates a new run-folder in /home/wallat/wandb_mnist_test/wandb/. The debug.log is empty though...
My guess was that the cluster's job manager is not letting me spawn more subprocesses, since it is crashing on that line. But I tried and spawning subprocesses seems not the be the problem either.

		This is really strange.  If debug.log is empty that indicates we weren't able to write to that file.  What are the permissions on it?  ls -al wandb

		I managed to figure out what was causing the problem. The job-manager of my cluster was starting the script from a private dir. This caused the os.getcwd() and sys.executable to direct to some dir like /var/lib/condor/execute/dir_25945 (the cluster is using ht condor).
When wandb.init() tried to open the subprocess like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, internal_cli_path, json.dumps(
        headless_args)], env=environ, **popen_kwargs)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

it had no permission to access the executable in that folder.
A workaround was manually setting sys.executable = '/usr/bin/python3'. After doing so, it worked like a charm. Not sure if that might cause problems with my cluster configuration later on, though.
But the problem was entirely on my side, so I am closing this issue. Thanks for the help.

		Good to know, we can provide a better error message in this case.
