	<summary>wandb fails on CUDA 8 and python3</summary>
	<description>

Weights and Biases version: 0.8.9 (according to pip)
Python version: 3.7.1
Operating System: linux

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

During any action with wandb, it fails on import (SyntaxError). This happens both in any script or any CLI action. We are running CUDA 8.0, and I guess pynvml that is being imported doesn't support python3.
Here's CUDA version:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2016 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Tue_Jan_10_13:22:03_CST_2017
Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.61
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Potential fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I skimmed the code and the repo, it seems pynvml (Python bindings for NVIDIA Management Library) is used only in meta.py and stats.py to log used GPU stats and GPU count. A possible fix would be to wrap imports with try-catch + fail flag, or maybe an environment flag to skip that part entirely.
I can make a pull request over this weekend, but let me know if you have something else in mind.

		This is strange, it seems like you have an environment issue where your PYTHON_PATH has python2 libraries in it.  Have you tried running this in a virtual environment?  I'm hesitant to make our library handle this case as we haven't heard this happening anywhere else.  Is there anything special about your environment?

		Maybe try doing a pip3 install pynvml --upgrade and see if that fixes it.

		You are right, thank you! Apparently old pynvml was in PYTHONPATH, and it was listed before site-packages. I've installed pynvml through pip, as you pointed out, and then run the script with custom PYTHONPATH where site-package is earlier than old pynvml path, and now it works OK.
I will close both the issue and the associated PR, since it's a configuration problem, not the library issue.

 hiÔºå
How can I solve this problem as follows?  The installed wandb can not be used normally, and other different versions of wandb have been tried. I also have try 0.9.5 version or oldest version and I have search in stackoverflow and baidu search engine.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Qnlp&gt;@Qnlp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this is really strange.  Can you print what  is after you've initialized the WandbLogger?  A quick thing to try is our prerelease library.  You can install with .
