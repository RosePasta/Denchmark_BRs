		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Nintorac&gt;@Nintorac&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this is currently by design.  You can change the colors in the UI by clicking on the circles.  We'll sync internally about the best thing to do in this case.

		Just a bit of a pain to manually change multiples of runs but must be done otherwise the runs cannot be visually distinguished. Might make more sense to try and base colours on hyper params but might be tricky to implement.
