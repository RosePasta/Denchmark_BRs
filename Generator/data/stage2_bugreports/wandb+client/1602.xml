	<summary>Discrepancy between scatter plot and custom plot</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
There seems to be a discrepancy between scatter plots generated using "Scatter plot" and those generated using "Custom chart".
The scatter chart looks accurate but the scatter plot seems to have a much larger number of runs.
To Reproduce
This seems to happen with any set of runs that I launch. Please let me know if you have trouble reproducing on your end and I can create a small program to share with you that will hopefully allow you to reproduce.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Open the webpage for a sweep
Click the '+' on a panel and add a Scatter chart. Choose a hyperparameter and plot it against some metric like error or reward.
Click the '+' on a panel and add a Custom chart. Create an equivalent custom chart using the scatter plot option plotting the same metrics.

Expected behavior
I expect the two charts to essentially show the same thing.

		Did a little more investigation and realized that the custom chart is pulling data from all of my runs, not just the current sweep. Sorry for the confusion. I must have the missed the part of the documentation where it indicates that this is the case.
