	<summary>wandb.watch(model): unwatch and rewatch models with new parameters, using Hugging Face</summary>
	<description>
wandb --version &amp;&amp; python --version &amp;&amp; uname

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I was trying to unwatch models and rewatch them with new parameters.  I am using the huggingface library which uses wandb.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What I Did&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;wandb.unwatch()
self._setup_wandb()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

self._setup_wandb() is defined basically as:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
wandb.watch(
                   self.model, log=os.getenv("WANDB_WATCH", "gradients"), log_freq=max(100, self.args.logging_steps)
               )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Now, looking into unwatch/unhook in the wandb code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; def unhook_all(self):
       for handle in self._hook_handles.values():
           handle.remove()
       self._hook_handles = []


   def unhook(self, name):
       handle = self._hook_handles.pop(name)
       handle.remove()

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is wrong, it seems that at some point self._hook_handles was changed to a dictionary, so unhook/unhook all should be something like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; def unhook_all(self):
       for handle in self._hook_handles.values():
           handle.remove()
       self._hook_handles = {}


   def unhook(self, name):
       handle = self._hook_handles[name]
       handle.remove()

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I havent tried this yet but I'll get back to it if I do.

		Hi Pedro, thanks for diving in to the  code, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/borisdayma&gt;@borisdayma&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you take a look?
As for un-watching and re-watching a model, it sounds like you're editing the model during training, is that right? I'd recommend calling wandb.init() to start a new run each time you want to watch a model with new parameters

		I can confirm issues with wandb.unwatch method. Maybe we should wait for the new CLI?

		Hi there, the fixed code I think solved the problem (no longer a missing get), but as you said, there needs to be another init or else an exception is thrown that the watcher should be reinitialized with a copy.  Is there any reason that you couldn't just add a watch to the new parameters? I am sure there are some internal logistics with references etc.  What I am doing is just changing the requires_grad of a few existing parameters at a certain iteration.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pedrocolon93&gt;@pedrocolon93&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the past few months we've majorly reworked the CLI and UI for Weights &amp; Biases. We're closing inactivate threads for the time being. Please comment to reopen.
