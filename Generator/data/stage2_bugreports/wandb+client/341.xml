replied to a thread:
hey! we have a checkpoint of 104.9MB in our wandb folder, and I notice it's not getting uploaded to the sync'd files. Anything I need to do to make sure large checkpoints get sync'd correctly?

It needs to go in the run subdirectory
e.g. run-20190519_210753-p0uj0rqx

It is under there. Seems like it actually attempts to sync the checkpoints all at the very end (note the models/iter_000150.model):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;wandb:   diff.patch

		In this run their model file was actually uploaded.  I think the stacktrace is specific to their code, but I'm not positive.
