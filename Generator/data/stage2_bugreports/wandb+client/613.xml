	<summary>Step deleted in patched tensorboard log</summary>
	<description>
When a summary is added through the patched tensorboard summary writer, the step is always removed before calling wandb.log. This results in the following warning:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;wandb: WARNING wandb.log called without a step keyword argument.  Pass the same step that tensorboard is using to avoid data loss see:
wandb: WARNING https://docs.wandb.com/docs/integrations/tensorboard.html#custom-metrics
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The warning only gets printed once, so I originally thought the warning was only due to logging the graph without a step, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/571&gt;#571&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but in fact the step passed to  is always ignored.
I tracked down the problem to the following lines:



client/wandb/tensorboard/__init__.py


        Lines 162 to 163
      in
      b90c8a8






 if "step" in kwargs: 



 del kwargs["step"] 





Why is it like this? I don't really mind that wandb does its own step counting, but it's a bit confusing and the warning is downright misleading if this is the intended behaviour.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Danmou&gt;@Danmou&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I have a branch that removes this warning we‚Äôll be releasing soon.  There are a few reasons we keep our own step counter

A run can have multiple tfevent files with different global_steps
If a user sets sync_tensorboard=True and also wants to call wandb.log to send custom artifacts this makes it simpler.
Tensorboard steps can go backwards, currently our step counter must increase

Our integration adds a ‚Äúglobal_step‚Äù key for each tensorboard namespace.  In the UI you can choose any step you‚Äôve logged as an x-axis for your charts.
We‚Äôre working on an overhaul of our metrics backend to address these issues.
Here‚Äôs my branch fixing the log error / better handling multiple tfevent namespaces: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/596/files&gt;https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/596/files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We made some quick fixes in 0.8.14 and this message will no longer be displayed.
