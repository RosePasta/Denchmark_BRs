	<summary>Search remote data will cause the data being deleted</summary>
	<description>
I've experimented on getting PySyft to work with remote worker with its own dataset.
During these, I found out the search from local will cause the data deleted on the remote.
Relevant files in &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/feigaoxyz/99dffd2f4336417f83f0cf4e1c80d8fd&gt;this gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
To trigger the error,

First run python remote.py in one terminal window
Then run python local.py from another terminal window

You will see the results:
$ python remote.py
Objects: {94139650912: tensor([-1.,  2.])
	Tags: x
	Shape: torch.Size([2])}
worker &lt;WebsocketServerWorker id:0 #tensors:1&gt; received SEARCH (b'x',)
worker &lt;WebsocketServerWorker id:0 #tensors:1&gt; received OBJ_DEL 94139650912
Objects: {}
$ python local.py
Local objects before search {}
Search result: [(Wrapper)&gt;[PointerTensor | me:68744693343 -&gt; 0:13527568418]]
Local objects after search {}
As the first one showed: the remote worker actually received two actions SEARCH and OBJ_DEL in correspondence with the search command on Line 20 of local.py.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This error can also be reproduced by slightly modifying the  by searching same term twice, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/feigaoxyz/99dffd2f4336417f83f0cf4e1c80d8fd#file-test_websocket_woker-py&gt;L57 of updated test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This is usually because a function (in this case search()) is returning pointers with self.garbage_collect_data==True. This means that when the pointers are deleted (garbage collected) that it sends a delete command to the remote machine.

 to work on your local setup?

		Yes, I can get this example working.
(A side note, perhaps it would be better to have some detail instructions in files to help others running.)

 can you open a new issue (or issues) pointing to parts of the documentation that are not clear?
Thank you!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/iamtrask&gt;@iamtrask&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Are you able to reproduce this error from your side?
The simplest way is to replicate the search and asserts again after the first round in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/4251f728bdff186328b7c24603dedf09e3037230/test/workers/test_websocket_worker.py#L51-L55&gt;this standard test file for websocket worker&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mari-linhares&gt;@mari-linhares&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Some of my thoughts on the "FL experiment" example as its current state:

add a readme to guide user to run the server with either


FLASK_APP=server.py flask run; or
add app.run() in server.py and run python server.py


a clean-up on ipynb.

I might put a PR when I got some time.
