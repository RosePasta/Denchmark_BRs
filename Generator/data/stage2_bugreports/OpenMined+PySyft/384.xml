	<summary>Capsule Snuck into PySyft Notebooks</summary>
	<description>
Several of the PySyft notebooks are now broken because they rely on a completely separate repository (Which has changed). We need to strip out reliance on Capsule in the following notebooks.

https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Homographic%20Encrypted%20Linear%20Classification%20example%20.ipynb
https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/notebooks/Syft%20-%20Paillier%20Encrypted%20Linear%20Classification.ipynb

Acceptance Criteria:

Remove Capsule dependencies from these notebooks and get them working
Move these notebooks to Capsule/notebooks folder and get them working

 awesome!! Working through getting the dependencies installed now. Is there a particular branch you are working off of? If not, I can create one here locally.
