	<summary>3 Tests fail when local worker is verbose</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When hook.local_worker is set to verbose the following errors occur
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;FAILED test/torch/test_hook.py::test_RNN_grad_set_backpropagation - RuntimeError: invalid argument 0: Sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 0. Got 57 and 128 in dimension 1 at ../aten/src/TH/generic/THTensor.cpp:711
FAILED test/torch/tensors/test_additive_shared.py::test_max - RuntimeError: Error, Please consider calling ".get" method instead of ".item" method, so you can be safely getting the item you need.
FAILED test/torch/tensors/test_additive_shared.py::test_argmax - RuntimeError: Error, Please consider calling ".get" method instead of ".item" method, so you can be safely getting the item you need.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To Reproduce
In test/conftest.py
put the line hook.local_worker.verbose=True in the hook function
Expected behavior
Tests should pass regardless of if they are printing output

 I've had a discussion about this with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/IonesioJunior&gt;@IonesioJunior&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 some time ago, we think this is due to the fact that garbage collector "gets stuck" since every time you're printing something you're creating a new reference to it, that tries to be deleted but then is printed again, ... and so on

		Having said that, if our intuition is right I'm not sure how easy is to get this fixed
