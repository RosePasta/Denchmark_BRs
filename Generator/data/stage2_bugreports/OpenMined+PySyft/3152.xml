		Were you able to install PySyft or not ?
If not then just try running

		I think udacity command also installs tf_encrypted besides core requirements.
That I think you can manually install in my opinion.

		I think we should mention that you can install tf_encrypted using req_udacity.txt in the pip-dep folder, should I make changes in the INSTALLATION.md?
