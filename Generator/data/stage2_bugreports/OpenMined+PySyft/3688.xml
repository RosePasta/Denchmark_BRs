	<summary>Error handling when CrypTen computation crashes</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Distributed CrypTen computation could fail due to many issues at the distributed worker level or in the local worker. We need to handle the different errors and share information between different workers in order to display clear error messages to the user accordingly.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A clear message should be displayed to the user with enough information.
