	<summary>Duplicated method name in base.py</summary>
	<description>
syft/workers/base.py contains two identically named register_obj methods:



PySyft/syft/workers/base.py


         Line 189
      in
      99190df






 def register_obj(self, obj): 





and



PySyft/syft/workers/base.py


         Line 553
      in
      99190df






 def register_obj(self, obj: object, obj_id: Union[str, int] = None): 





In best python tradition, only the latter one actually gets called, but we should fix that.

 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gmuraru&gt;@gmuraru&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hello! Just letting you know that we are no longer planning on supporting anything on the 0.2.x product line and that all work should be ported over to 0.3.x, which is considered a complete rebuild of PySyft. Because of that, I'll be closing this issue. If you feel this is a mistake, or if the issue actually applies to 0.3.x as well, please feel free to ping me on Slack and I'll reopen the issue.
