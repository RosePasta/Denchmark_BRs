	<summary>Move() on same machine</summary>
	<description>
Dear all,
I was not sure whether to classify this as a "bug" or "new feature", please move it in case this is wrong.
Is the behavior of the move() method intended to throw an error, when trying to move an object to a virtual worker that already possesses the object?
In case this happens, a objectnotfounderror is raised:
_ObjectNotFoundError: Object "56137057453" not found on worker!!! You just tried to interact with an object ID:56137057453 on &lt;VirtualWorker id:manager_alice #objects:12&gt; which does not exist!!! Use .send() and .get() on all your tensors to make sure they're on the same machines. If you think this tensor does exist, check the .objects dictionary on the worker and see for yourself!!! The most common reason this error happens is because someone calls .get() on the object's pointer without realizing it (which deletes the remote object and sends it to the pointer). Check your code to make sure you haven't already called .get() on this pointer!!!
Of course one can handle this in the control logic by checking the object ownership before calling the move method, but I think it would be nice if the move() method just ignores the request in case one tries to move objects that a worker already possesses.
When looping over multiple workers this would simplify the control logic.
