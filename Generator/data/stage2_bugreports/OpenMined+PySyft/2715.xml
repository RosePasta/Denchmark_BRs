	<summary>WebsocketClientWorker:  TimeoutError:Connection timed out</summary>
	<description>
I use "python run_websocket_server.py --port 8780 --id bob --host 10.0.0.5" on my Mac to run the run_websocket_server.py under the examples/tutorials/advanced/websockets-example-MNIST-parallel folder. And I want to connect it with Linux server. I import packages and run the following codes in ipython.
hook = sy.TorchHook(torch)
kwargs_websocket = {"host": "10.0.0.5", "hook": hook, "verbose": False}
bob = WebsocketClientWorker(id="bob", port=8780, **kwargs_websocket)
But it reports an error--TimeoutError: [Errno 110] Connection timed out
How could I solve this problem?
If possible, could you write a detailed document that implements federated learning on different computer devices? I sincerely hope there can be an example realized by different computers, but not all servers in one computer.

		Hi, does it work in local mode? (connected through the localhost)
Also, cross device computation will increasingly handled in PyGrid

		If both servers' "host" are "localhost", it is OK

		Interesting! So yes I think Websocket with PySyft currently only work in local networks. You need to use PyGrid across devices, but maybe the PyGrid team can confirm
