	<summary>relu and relu_deriv require serializable workers</summary>
	<description>
This is a blocker for having EMLaaS implemented.
Relu and relu_derive require serializable workers. Apparently these operations require serializable workers in order to execute .share with pointer tensors. GridWorkers are currently not serializable.

 pointed out that serializing workers is not actually a problem since this consists basically of sending the worker id over the wire.
But the problem is that currently only VirtualWorkers are serializable which means that GridWorkers or WebsocketWorkers will not be able to run these operations.
