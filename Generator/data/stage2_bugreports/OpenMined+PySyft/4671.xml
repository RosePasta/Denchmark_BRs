	<summary>Fix broken float tests</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are two tests marked @pytest.mark.xfail in id_test.py which need to be fixed.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Remove the annotations marked @pytest.mark.xfail then run the fast tests:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ pytest -m fast
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Tests should pass
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Definition of Done&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

PR should be posted with passing test suite and @pytest.mark.xfail annotations removed.
If there is a good reason these tests cannot pass that should be documented and then explained here.

 Yes, this is for 0.3 but contributions are welcome. If you checkout syft_0.3.0 and then branch from there and make this change that would be amazing. Just a note, the "slow" tests are currently failing on the 0.3.0 branch which i am fixing now in another PR, so don't be surprised if that happens. This task only applies to the fast tests.
Also this might not be the easiest task for starting on the 0.3 code base, so sorry if I labelled it that way, its hard to know if the work has been done yet or it's just still left off. Feel free to try or if you don't want to thats also okay. ðŸ˜Š
If you have any questions just write them here or ping me on slack and I can try to help.
