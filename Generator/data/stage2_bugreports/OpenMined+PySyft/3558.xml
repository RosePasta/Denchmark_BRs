	<summary>'VirtualWorker' object has no attribute '_tensors' in tutorial - 9</summary>
	<description>
I am completely new to PySyft and got an error of "VirtualWorker' object has no attribute '_tensors", when I am working in Encrypted Domain Computation. Please help me.
import torch
import syft as sy
hook = sy.TorchHook(torch)
bob = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="bob")
alice = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="alice")
bill = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="bill")
x = torch.tensor([25])
x
tensor([25])
x = torch.tensor([25]).share(bob, alice, bill)
bobs_share = list(bob._tensors.values())[0]
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
 in ()
13 x = torch.tensor([25]).share(bob, alice, bill)
14
---&gt; 15 bobs_share = list(bob._tensors.values())[0]

 I think this was broken by a recent change. Try ?

 Thanks for your reply..
I tried "ob.object_store._tensors" but this is not working showing same error..
VirtualWorker' object has no attribute 'object_store
However, I reinstalled the complete Syft and other dependencies in a new Conda environment. It's working great.
