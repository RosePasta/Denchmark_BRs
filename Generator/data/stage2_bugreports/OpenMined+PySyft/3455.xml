	<summary>Multiple workers same ID</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
If we have multiple workers with the same id, it causes all sorts of weird and wonderful errors further down the line when it comes to encryption or training etc. none of which tell you that the problem is that you have two workers with the same id. Instead you get things like AttributeError: 'AutogradTensor' object has no attribute 'fix_prec' or IndexError: list index out of range, etc.etc. I know it seems obvious that one shouldn't create two workers with the same id but it's quite easy to do accidentally and then very difficult to track the error back to it. I think pysyft should throw an error or at the very least a warning when one creates a worker whose id is already taken.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Go to Notebook 12 in examples/tutorials (or any other one really)
Change bob's id to "alice`
Run the cells sequentially
See error during training

Expected behavior
An error/warning when creating a worker whose id already exists or an informative error later on when this causes problems saying that the root of the problem is the fact that two workers have the same id
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu
Version 18.04

Additional context
Tested on 0.2.3 and 0.2.4
Another instance of this problem (in case anyone else runs into this) is when running unit tests. Virtual Workers persist between separate tests so even in separate tests, if two workers have the same id, you get errors, except they get more confusing and start to mess with other completely separate tests that don't even use syft (but do use torch)
