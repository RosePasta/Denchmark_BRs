	<summary>Train models with new approch of grid</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Question&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Does the tool already have documentation support for training models with the new grid approach?
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Further Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

For example, I am trying to train a model, following the steps of the notebook that is available &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/examples/tutorials/grid/federated_learning/mnist/Fed.Learning%20MNIST%20%5B%20Part-1%20%5D%20-%20Populate%20a%20Grid%20Network%20(%20Dataset%20).ipynb&gt;p1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/examples/tutorials/grid/federated_learning/mnist/Fed.Learning%20MNIST%20%5B%20Part-2%20%5D%20-%20Train%20a%20Model.ipynb&gt;p2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, with the  model and  database, but with the new grid approach, described below.
import syft as sy
import torch as th

hook = sy.TorchHook(th)
alice = sy.grid.register()

node1 = alice.connect("bob")
node1.search("#mnist")
    Tags: #mnist 
    Shape: torch.Size([5000, 1, 28, 28])]
For training I use the old approach. But the prediction is in a loop. Is training done any other way?
Loop line:
pred = model(data[i][j])
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;System Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS: Linux
OS Version: Ubuntu 18
Language Version: Python 3.7
Package Manager Version: Conda

Ps.: The new approach to the grid is really cool, I'm really enjoying using it :)
