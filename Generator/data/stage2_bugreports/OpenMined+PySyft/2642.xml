	<summary>Part 07 example has abnormally high loss</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
In the /example folder, Part 07 has a very high loss amount, even after 10 epochs.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run Jupyter Notebook
Go to the 7th example and run the notebook all the way through.  The last code blog where you train the model creates an abnormally high loss rate... in the thousands.

Expected behavior
I'd expect the loss to be much lower.
