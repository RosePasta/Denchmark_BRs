	<summary>SVD is returning 4 pointers instead of 3</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When sending a tensor to a worker and performing SVD, returns four pointers instead of three. Also, the third one is not gettable. By experimentation, I have had to solve the issue using U, s, _, V = x.svd().
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import torch
import syft as sy

hook = sy.TorchHook(torch)
bob = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id='bob')

x = torch.rand(250, 84).send(bob)  # Synthetic tensor
x.svd()

# Output:
# ((Wrapper)&gt;[PointerTensor | me:88822589827 -&gt; bob:10423896311],
#  (Wrapper)&gt;[PointerTensor | me:22528885369 -&gt; bob:34285527022],
#  (Wrapper)&gt;[PointerTensor | me:46709676193 -&gt; bob:67244907535],
#  (Wrapper)&gt;[PointerTensor | me:235847656 -&gt; bob:15738446586])
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Should return three pointers: U, s, V = x.svd()
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;System Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		this is pretty weird I run this code in debug mode, stepped into every function, the things seemed correct while computing the response (3 tensors were returned),  and in the end got this error : (which shows things were correct 3 tensor returned as expected)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Exception has occurred: ValueError
not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)
  File "/home/nilansh/Anton/OpenMined/PySyft/debug.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    U, s, _, V = x.svd()

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but returns 4 values when run as normal python code.

 could you test this? It should be solved on on the 0.2.x branch

		Hello! Just letting you know that we are no longer planning on supporting anything on the 0.2.x product line and that all work should be ported over to 0.3.x, which is considered a complete rebuild of PySyft. Because of that, I’ll be closing this issue. If you feel this is a mistake, or if the issue actually applies to 0.3.x as well, please feel free to ping me on Slack and I’ll reopen the issue.
