	<summary>Rank to Worker_ID translation should be linked to a specific CrypTen computation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Server workers are intended to run multiple queries from client in parallel. Starting multiple CrypTen computation on the same worker at a time should be possible, however, due to the current way of storing the rank-to-worker-id translation, starting a new computation will overwrite the old translation dictionary and lead to undefined behavior.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Start a server worker supporting CrypTen messages
Start two consecutive and long CrypTen computations with different workers involved

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running parallel CrypTen computation should work normally as if they were run sequentially.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Additional Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
