	<summary>Test share for keras does not work on macos in a virtual env</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Due to firewall issues, it is not possible to run test share on macos in a venv. This can be remedied by replacing network calls with mock.
To Reproduce
run make_test on a fresh macos install
