	<summary>Check dependency CrypTen tests</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Currently, CrypTen is available only on Linux and Mac, but if someone installs the PySyft repo and run the tests we also have some CrypTen related tests.
Those should be taken into consideration only if we have dependency_check.crypten.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run the tests on Windows
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

All the tests should pass - maybe skip the tests for CrypTen.
