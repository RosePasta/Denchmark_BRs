Comparison operations mainly &lt;, &gt;, ==, &lt;=, &gt;= are broken for SNN protocol when we use it for FPT and AST.

		Hello! Just letting you know that we are no longer planning on supporting anything on the 0.2.x product line and that all work should be ported over to 0.3.x, which is considered a complete rebuild of PySyft. Because of that, I’ll be closing this issue. If you feel this is a mistake, or if the issue actually applies to 0.3.x as well, please feel free to ping me on Slack and I’ll reopen the issue.
