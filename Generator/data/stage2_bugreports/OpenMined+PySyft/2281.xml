		On Windows the web socket client also fails to connect giving the error below.
OverflowError: timeout doesn't fit into C timeval
Appears to be due to the timeout interval (TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 9_999_999) specified in websocket_client.py.

		I saw the PR "[WIP] Implement start_remote_worker &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/pull/2345&gt;#2345&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
" where its mentioned that start_proc would get replaced with start_remote_worker. Hence, wanted to check if this issue is still valid and needs to be worked upon?

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/amit-rastogi&gt;@amit-rastogi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
The new function actually uses start_proc, so yes, this issue is still valid.
