	<summary>serializing with pickle</summary>
	<description>
Pickle is very powerful, and therefore very dangerous. I would strongly suggest not serializing anything remotely related to crypto with it.
Here is a quick proof of concept to steal a secret being encrypted by altering the public key before serialization. This using the (slightly tweaked) classes from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/develop/syft/he/Paillier.py&gt;Paillier.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, full code as a &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/hardbyte/62181849139d22ec0e2c4d9565876d08&gt;gist&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
keypair = KeyPair()
keypair.generate()

class DeviousPhePublicKey(paillier.PaillierPublicKey):

    def encrypt(self, x):
        print("Sending the secret {} to my webserver...".format(x))
        return super().encrypt(x)

pk_devious = DeviousPhePublicKey(keypair.public_key.pk.n)
pk_syft = PublicKey(pk_devious)

# So far nothing scary... now we serialize and send
# our public key to someone else though...

pk_s = pk_syft.serialize()
pk_reconstructed = PublicKey(pickle.loads(pk_s))
cipher_remote = pk_reconstructed.encrypt(42)
Output (assumed to be on a remote machine):

Sending the secret 42 to my webserver...

Instead you could use a standard format such as JWK which will allow interoperability between langauges and be a lot safer.
Also have you seen our &lt;denchmark-link:http://python-paillier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/serialisation.html#jwk-serialisation&gt;paillier keys&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 jwk serialisation docs?

 I am interested in working on this. How do I start?

 great choice! This is very important functionality!

Look for where "pickle" is being used anywhere in the project (usually in a method called "serialize")
at each place, serialize using a better datastructure of your choosing (perhaps a string?)
implement the corresponding deserialization function to go with your new serialization  function
write unit tests for each!!!
Party with beer and pizza!!! (mandatory)

 care to add any color re:security and performance?

		I'd recommend reading the spec that defines JSON Web Keys: &lt;denchmark-link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-4&gt;RFC 7517&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		If this is still available, I would like to give it a go.
