	<summary>torch.tensor.size() function may get wrong shape after the tensor is sending to a gpu.</summary>
	<description>
I use syft to execute a FL task, I found sometimes the torch.tensor.size() will get wrong results.
Here I implement the following code in a ubuntu 16 system to show this bug:



import torch
import syft as sy
data = torch.randn([8, 24, 24, 24, 3, 5])
target = torch.randn([8, 24, 24, 24, 3, 5])
data = data.cuda()
targe&gt;&gt;&gt; target = target.cuda()
hook = sy.TorchHook(torch=torch)
worker1 = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="worker1")
data.send(worker1)
(Wrapper)&gt;[PointerTensor | me:32788080090 -&gt; worker1:15663574719]
data.location
data = data.send(worker1)
data.location
&lt;VirtualWorker id:worker1 #objects:1&gt;
target = target.send(worker1)
target.location
&lt;VirtualWorker id:worker1 #objects:2&gt;
data.size()
torch.Size([0])
target.size()
torch.Size([0])
data.shape
torch.Size([8, 24, 24, 24, 3, 5])
target.shape
torch.Size([8, 24, 24, 24, 3, 5])



As shown above, we can see that when one tensor has been sent to a gpu and a worker , it's .size() function get torch.Size([0]), I don't know why this happens, and it's .shape attribute still works.
Another problem I found is for a torch.nn.Module object, we name it as model, model.send(worker).cuda() may throw exception, while model.cuda().send(worker) works.
