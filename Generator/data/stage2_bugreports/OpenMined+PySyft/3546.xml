	<summary>Jupyter bug due to Tornado when following readme pre-installation</summary>
	<description>
I followed the installation guide in the readme and had an issue using Jupyter due to its incompatibility with Tornado.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Follow pre-installation and installation guide, Install virtual environment
Run conda install jupyter notebook  to install jupyter&gt;6
Running pip install 'syft[udacity]' will install tornado==4.5.3 as required by pip-dep requirements

Expected behavior
run jupyter notebook and you will not be able to see files or do any work.

As stated by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ltalirz&gt;ltalirz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 "this occurs when using notebook&gt;=6 with tornado&lt;5
E.g. try pip install 'notebook&lt;6' or conda install 'notebook&lt;6'."
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2400&gt;related issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Temporary solution
pip install 'notebook&lt;6' worked for me
I hope this can be fixed as it will prevent new people from doing any work without looking up a solution for this first.

		Hmm, a compatible notebook version is listed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/pip-dep/requirements_notebooks.txt#L2&gt;requirements_notebook.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Should it also be in ?

		Alternately, maybe it would be cleaner to add the notebook requirements to the  extras in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/setup.py#L53&gt;setup.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		Thanks for replying &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/karlhigley&gt;@karlhigley&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Any or both solutions look great. You could also add the  version requirement to the readme  Jupyter install or  to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/pip-dep/requirements.txt&gt;pip-dep requirements&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I saw that it's listed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/blob/master/pip-dep/requirements_notebooks.txt#L2&gt;requirements_notebook.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but you won't install those requirements if you follow the readme. Maybe installing with  won't yield this bug but I was not able to do so due to an  error, which could be another issue by the way.
