	<summary>FV cipher-text data change during decryption.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

During the decryption process, the ciphertext was soft copied and it changed the ciphertext value during decryption. So we lose the value of ciphertext.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;How to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Create a ciphertext
Decrypt that ciphertext
Retry to decrypt the same ciphertext (wrong result)

		This issue was not caught by earlier tests because for every test of encryption-decryption process new parameters were generated and every ciphertext was tested for correct values only ones
