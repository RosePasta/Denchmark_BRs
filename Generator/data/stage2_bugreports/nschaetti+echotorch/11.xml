	<summary>Not able to run the examples</summary>
	<description>
Hi Nils,
I just installed EchoTorch and tried to run one of the examples provided by EchoTorch.
After running: python validation_10cv.py, it raised the following errors. It is the same on Windows and Ubuntu. Thanks.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "validation_10cv.py", line 25, in 
from echotorch import datasets
File "C:\Users\guan\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\echotorch_init_.py", line 5, in 
import datasets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datasets'

		Hi,
The 10CV example is obsolete as I transfered the ReutersC50Dataset class to TorchLanguage. However, I fixed some import errors and tested importing the dataset module and it worked.
Which version of Python do you use ?
Regards,
Nils
