	<summary>Require a save directory?</summary>
	<description>
Several parts of the Trainer class require a location to save to but don't complain until it is too late.
Examples are (of course) when a save point is specified via save_every, but the trainer also defaults to saving after a validation run even without a necessary directory.

		Had another look, and you're right that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nasimrahaman/inferno/blob/e846592e5a660d972ab6eeaf46cb92656f88c792/inferno/trainers/basic.py#L81&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should definitely default to False.
