	<summary>Add attention mask to global attn at training/test.</summary>
	<description>
I think the attention mask over source words isn't used in current version of OpenNMT-py, ie GlobalAttention.applyMask is never called. It was there in the previous one.
This makes training incorrect and decoding with batch_size &gt; 1 terrible.

		Are you seeing this in practice? It didn't change my results to remove it.
Attention mask only at decoding seems hacky. If we add it back, let's do it everywhere.

		For when we implement this, let's do it like it is done with transformer.
Change RNNDecoderState to save the  like  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/onmt/modules/Transformer.py#L284&gt;https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/onmt/modules/Transformer.py#L284&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Compute the src_pad_mask in the RNN decoder like: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/onmt/modules/Transformer.py#L255&gt;https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/onmt/modules/Transformer.py#L255&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Augment GlobalAttention to take a mask like : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/onmt/modules/MultiHeadedAttn.py&gt;https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/onmt/modules/MultiHeadedAttn.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This way Translator does not need to know about this. This could be done as part of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/issues/268&gt;#268&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		My result is sensible with batch_size 1. Maybe having explicit use of attention masks is useful for multiseq2multiseq task.

		okay, yeah then I agree this is a bug if you are seeing different results. wonder why mine did not change. We will fix asap.
