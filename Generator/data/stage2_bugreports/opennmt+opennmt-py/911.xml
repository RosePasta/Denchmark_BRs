	<summary>StopIteration Error when using Python 3.7</summary>
	<description>
When I use Python 3.7 to run preprocess.py, I got the following error. The same error does not occur when I use Python 3.6.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/cephfs2/asr/users/zewei.chu/SQuAD/round-trip-translation/OpenNMT-py/onmt/inputters/text_dataset.py", line 384, in __iter__
    raise StopIteration
StopIteration

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

		I think I know where this one is coming from: there's a kind of weird generator function that manually raises StopIteration. This is an error in 3.7, whereas in older versions of python it was simply something you shouldn't ever need to do. A quick fix might just be to replace the raise StopIteration lines with return.
In the longer term, I'm working on simplifying the preprocessing code and the method that causes this problem is already on my list.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bpopeters&gt;@bpopeters&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, why was it made an error in 3.7? I've also got a broken generator as a result. And I think mine raises StopIteration for a very good reason :)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tavin&gt;@tavin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the proposal is discussed &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Is this a problem you're having with OpenNMT-py? I thought we solved this bug last year, but I've been away from OpenNMT-py development for a while so it's possible it could have come up again.

		Thanks for the reference &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bpopeters&gt;@bpopeters&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. No it's nothing to do with OpenNMT-py. I just came across this thread as the top google result for my issue and you seemed to know the details.
