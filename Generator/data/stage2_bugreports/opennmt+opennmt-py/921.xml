	<summary>Multi-GPU error with pytorch 0.4.1</summary>
	<description>
okay there is a bug with pytorch 0.4.1 and multi gpu.
I am trying to figure out what's wrong
But if you see this (line 171 of trainer.py)
RuntimeError: arguments are located on different GPUs
This is the error triggered, it seems to try to sum items of a list from different GPU.
This was not an issue in 0.4.0
Please use pytorch 0.4.0 in the meantime.
