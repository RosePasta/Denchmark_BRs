	<summary>"TypeError: 'module' object is not callable" when running translate with SRU model</summary>
	<description>
Hi!
I trained an SRU model, but I can't get it working for translating input.
Here is the full exception:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "translate.py", line 126, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "translate.py", line 48, in main
    translator = onmt.Translator(opt, dummy_opt.__dict__)
  File "/home/anton/projects/OpenNMT-py/onmt/Translator.py", line 29, in __init__
    model_opt, self.fields, use_gpu(opt), checkpoint)
  File "/home/anton/projects/OpenNMT-py/onmt/ModelConstructor.py", line 129, in make_base_model
    encoder = make_encoder(model_opt, src_embeddings)
  File "/home/anton/projects/OpenNMT-py/onmt/ModelConstructor.py", line 70, in make_encoder
    opt.rnn_size, opt.dropout, embeddings)
  File "/home/anton/projects/OpenNMT-py/onmt/Models.py", line 74, in __init__
    bidirectional=bidirectional)
TypeError: 'module' object is not callable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, I can successfully translate using an LSTM model.
I'm running this under Python 3.6 with torch==0.3.0.post4 and torchtext==0.1.1.
I would appreciate any help.

		Can you check that you have all the SRU reqs installed?
in onmt.modules does check_sru_requirement() return true.

		I'm sorry, I didn't see your response. Yes, check_sru_requirement() returns True. Was this issue closed because the problem has been fixed?

		Nope, sorry we'll look into it more.
