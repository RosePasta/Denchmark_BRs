	<summary>Torchtext v0.2 issue</summary>
	<description>
I followed the instructions in Quickstart to train the model, and after training some time it showed the following errors, it there any way to solve it ?

 I have upgraded my torchtext to 0.2.0 and this issue still exists, please reopen this issue.

 , seems we need some modification based on  as well.
I didn't encounter this problem in my environment, could you help test if this patch helps solve this problem?  If you encounter any problem, please post the trackback.

		I run this patch and it works fine now, thank you very much.

		I hit the same error today. This happened with torchtext (0.2.0a0) and torch (0.2.0.post4) with default installation
I just downgraded torchtext with pip install torchtext==0.1.1 as a temporary/quick fix, it works.
Going forward:

the code should be patched with the above patch #345 (comment)
OR
requirements.txt should force the torchtext==0.1.1

		Since we'd already made the decision to change the sort behavior in torchtext source, and some people had started to rely on that, we basically had to break things slightly for either 0.1 users/ONMT or source users. Sorry about that; hopefully the two issues from 0.1.1 -&gt; 0.2 can be resolved quickly.

		Add ``sort_within_batch=False'' as follows (train.py) will fix this issue.
valid_iter = table.IO.OrderedIterator(
        dataset=valid_data, batch_size=opt.batch_size, device=opt.gpuid[0], train=False, sort=True, sort_within_batch=False)

  Thx for the answer. But, it seems no $"valid_iter = table.IO.OrderedIterator(
dataset=valid_data, batch_size=opt.batch_size, device=opt.gpuid[0], train=False, sort=True, sort_within_batch=False)"$ in the train.py file

 Thx, Jianyu. Thank you for your instrument. Heard this kind of stuff first time. Could you also tell me what this file will do? What knowledge can help me to understand this?

 ,  the problem in this issue is due to some change in the new version of (our project depends on it), so our project need fix to accommodate this change.
The code is generated by git diff, which shows code difference between the base version and the modified version, and the diff output is usually called patch, and it can be patched into base version by the tool patch.

		Hello, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jekbradbury&gt;@jekbradbury&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,  is the fix available on PyPI?  If yes, we will resolve the problems on our side.
