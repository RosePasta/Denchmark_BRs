	<summary>Fixed seeds do not work</summary>
	<description>
I set the "opt.seed" as a positive int value, however, the output results are different each time without changing anything. How can I reproduce the result of models?

		Are you training using GPU?  If yes, you probably need to use this ,  see &lt;denchmark-link:http://pytorch.org/docs/master/cuda.html?highlight=torch%20manual_seed#torch.cuda.manual_seed&gt;http://pytorch.org/docs/master/cuda.html?highlight=torch%20manual_seed#torch.cuda.manual_seed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If that works, I will change the code. Thanks.

		Yes, it has been used in train.py as follow.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if opt.gpuid:
    cuda.set_device(opt.gpuid[0])
    if opt.seed &gt; 0:
        torch.cuda.manual_seed(opt.seed)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It does not work.

		Huh.. Is this a pytorch issue? What else should we be doing to make sure the seed is used?

		I think it maybe the seed of torchtext.data.Iterator is not fixed? Do you know how to fix it?

		Yes, it is the problem of IO.py. Because torchtext.data.Iterator shuffle the data by the package "random". You can insert the code:
import random
random.seed([your seed])
It works.

		Oh that's a good catch. Can you send a PR?

		randomness still exist, after setting the seed for ``random'' in train.py

		Seems still not work due to the torchtext problem.

		Same, it does not seem to work for me either. Setting the random.seed() does not change a seed. It would be great to be able to control the order of the samples drawn by the iterator at each epoch for reproducibility.
