	<summary>Sharp decrease in model quality</summary>
	<description>
I just all the torchtext commits and tested a small model on which I can expect to get very good results. Validation perplexity after 13 epochs was 1.01. However, the predictions from translate.py were much worse -- way worse. The issue appears similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/issues/137&gt;#137&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Results are very bad with the default batch_size and get better when the batch_size is 1. However, there is an added wrinkle -- when the batch size is 1, the model systematically does predict the final token that it should. This makes me suspect that, besides the batch problem, there is an indexing problem or something going on somewhere that's causing the predictions to get cut off.

		Can you send me your model? I think this will be all fixed in this coming PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/pull/195&gt;#195&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , but I don't have a test yet.

And here's a set for which the predictions should exactly match tgt.test almost always.

		90% sure the problem is in Translator.buildTargetTokens(). The last token is removed because it's supposed to be EOS. Based on what I'm seeing, it wasn't EOS.

		I have confirmed that these are now working and added them as tests.
