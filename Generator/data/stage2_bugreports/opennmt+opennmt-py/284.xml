	<summary>Blank lines in preprocess.</summary>
	<description>
EDIT: maybe just the fact that target shouldn't have case feature in the py version ....
Hi,
I took a dataset tokenized (with case feature) by the Lua version.
I got this error:
Preparing training ...
Building Training...
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "preprocess.py", line 78, in 
main()
File "preprocess.py", line 60, in main
train = onmt.IO.ONMTDataset(opt.train_src, opt.train_tgt, fields, opt)
File "/home/moses/pytorchwork/OpenNMT-py/onmt/IO.py", line 132, in init
src_data = self._read_corpus_file(src_path, src_truncate)
File "/home/moses/pytorchwork/OpenNMT-py/onmt/IO.py", line 203, in _read_corpus_file
return [extract_features(line) for line in lines]
File "/home/moses/pytorchwork/OpenNMT-py/onmt/IO.py", line 35, in extract_features
token_size = len(split_tokens[0])
IndexError: list index out of range
is it the number of token in a line or the number of lines the culprit ?

 think you were looking at this at one point. Any ideas?

		Actually I did it again with datasets that have no features and I get the exact same error.

		Based on

Your stack trace
The fact that the error occurs without features
My failure to reproduce this error with any of my datasets (I get no error without target features and a different error with them)

I think that most likely the bug is with your data. I have a hunch that you'd see this particular error if your the files you're passing to preprocess.py contain any blank lines. Do they?

		yes like in most public datasets ....
I think we need to allow this.

		Okay, let's do it
Matches this one too &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/issues/252&gt;#252&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
