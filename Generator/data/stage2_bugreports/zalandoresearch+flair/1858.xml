Since the new Update 0.6 i have this Error:
"ERROR! Session/line number was not unique in database. History logging moved to new session 2"
I'm using flair on a Kaggle.com notebook
The confusing thing is that in the line where the Error appears first there is no functionality from Flair.
But what i can say, the code was running on the 0.5 version of flair.
I would run it on the old version but in the old version i can't load the embeddings anymore.
Thanks for your help
`filename = "../input/train-data/train_data.json"
with open(filename,'r', encoding='utf8') as infile:
example_data = json.load(infile)
for i,(k,v) in enumerate(example_data.items()):
tokens = v.get('tokens')
tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens]
example_data[k]['tokens'] = tokens
all_tokens = [v['tokens'] for k,v in example_data.items()]
all_labels = [v['labels'] for k,v in example_data.items()]`
