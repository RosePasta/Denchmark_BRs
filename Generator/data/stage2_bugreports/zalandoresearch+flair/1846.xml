	<summary>Strange observation for Sentiment Analysis</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I have a strange observation for Sentiment Analysis task. I gave it text which include both positive &amp; negative polarity sentences but the score is overwhelmingly positive.
To Reproduce
import flair
flair_sentiment = flair.models.TextClassifier.load('en-sentiment')
sentence = "I am very happy. I am also very sad"
s = flair.data.Sentence(sentence)
flair_sentiment.predict(s)
sentiment = s.labels
print( sentiment )
output is:
[POSITIVE (0.996)]
Expected behavior
Given that the text contains "very happy" and "very sad", I expect the score/confidence of sentiment to be much lower (maybe around 0.5)
Environment (please complete the following information):
Google colab

		It could be that the model never sees such examples in the training data - this is often the problem with constructed examples. If you sentence-split the data, does the model work?
