from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.models import SequenceTagger
sentence = Sentence("I love Berlin .")
tagger = SequenceTagger.load("/home/hadoop/.flair/models/en-ner-conll03-v0.2.pt")
tagger.predict(sentence)
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Also, can the model download link be provided?

		The old models from flair 0.2 no longer work, you should use the newest ones. Can you do SequenceTagger.load('ner') instead?
