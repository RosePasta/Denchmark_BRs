	<summary>Problematic usage of mmap in file_utils.load_big_file</summary>
	<description>
Currently file_units.load_big_file returns an mmap.mmap, which is ultimately passed to torch.load:



flair/flair/file_utils.py


        Lines 25 to 36
      in
      0e1a182






 def load_big_file(f: str) -&gt; mmap.mmap: 



 """ 



     Workaround for loading a big pickle file. Files over 2GB cause pickle errors on certin Mac and Windows distributions. 



     :param f: 



     :return: 



     """ 



 logger.info(f"loading file {f}") 



 with open(f, "rb") as f_in: 



 # mmap seems to be much more memory efficient 



 bf = mmap.mmap(f_in.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ) 



 f_in.close() 



 return bf 








flair/flair/nn.py


        Lines 85 to 86
      in

 f = file_utils.load_big_file(str(model_file)) 



 state = torch.load(f, map_location=flair.device) 





On Python 3.8.0 and 3.8.1, this usage &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32289&gt;raises an exception&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which was reported upstream to CPython as &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.python.org/issue39681&gt;https://bugs.python.org/issue39681&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
In the CPython bug, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pitrou&gt;@pitrou&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 pointed out that it will likely be faster and more efficient to wrap the  in a . It's also possible that support for loading a pickle file wrapped in an  will be removed in a future version of Python.
