	<summary>HashTag ignored for Column Corpus</summary>
	<description>

When reading from a ColumnCorpus, lines with hash tags are ignored. This may bring problems to tasks such as Wnut17(there are hash tags at start of words.)
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/b0e4cc1a92c4bd56536ed4e09c8ff6cb1a89f08c/flair/datasets.py#L424&gt;https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/b0e4cc1a92c4bd56536ed4e09c8ff6cb1a89f08c/flair/datasets.py#L424&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To Reproduce
Run NER experiment with Wnut17.
Expected behavior
Hash-tag-starting words should be kept.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS [e.g. iOS, Linux]: linux
Version [e.g. flair-0.3.2]: flair-0.4.2

Additional context

 thanks for spotting this - I can reproduce the error. Hash tags are used in CoNLL-U datasets to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/docs/issues/642&gt;denote comments&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which is why we currently ignore lines that begin with them.
However, you're right that we need special rules for some datasets such as WNUT where a line that begins with a hash tag is just a word. Will put in a PR for this!
