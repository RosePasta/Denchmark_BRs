	<summary>Sentence() indexing behaves strangely when running on CPU</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I found out that on CPU, no matter what model I load (news-forward, news-forward-fast), the 0-th element of Sentence() is None, which should be the first Token in the textual sentence. I'm running on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, and PyTorch 0.4.1.
I see
Sentence("He like apple .")[0] = None
Which should be
Sentence("He like apple .")[0] = Token: He

		It seems it currently uses the token id, which begins at 1. So, you can get the first token with Sentence("He like apple .")[1]. But we will fix this in the next version!

		It was already fixed and merged into the master branch (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/62&gt;#62&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
The feature will be included in the next release.

		Ah yes! Ok, so it will be part of release 0.3. Or if you use the current master branch instead of installing through pip then it's already fixed now!
