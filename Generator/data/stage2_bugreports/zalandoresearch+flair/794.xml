	<summary>Tutorial 7: Training a model - Sample code needs correction (post release 0.4.2)</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Release 0.4.2 changes the model loading mechanism. As per the docs

it removes the load_from_file() methods, which are now part of the load() method

The sample code in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_7_TRAINING_A_MODEL.md&gt;Tutorial 7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 uses  and  methods instead of the new  method to load an already trained model for evaluation.
