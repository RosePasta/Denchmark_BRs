	<summary>When training NER, best-model.pt doesn't give the highest f-scores that was found during training</summary>
	<description>
During training, evaluation after epoch 63, gives f-score of 0.8902. But, evaluation after the training with best-model.pt gives 0.8893 which is not the best. This best-model f-score is same as the final-model (of the last epoch).

 by default, the best model is selected based on the score for the DEV dataset. So the epoch that scored best on DEV is saved as best-model.pt. Is this not happening in your case?
