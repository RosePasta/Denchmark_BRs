	<summary>Loading a saved LM model forgets previous best validation score</summary>
	<description>
When i load a previous trained LM model, and run few more epochs even if my model gets worst score then before it will update best-lm.pt
as code suggests, as trainig start  Best val score is set to 10000 by default even if my previous score was far less than that.
