	<summary>windows 10 64 bit pytorch freeze_support() error</summary>
	<description>

I am seeing this error - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7485&gt;pytorch/pytorch#7485&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Steps to reproduce the behavior (e.g. which model did you train? what parameters did you use? etc.).
I'm following the tutorial here - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_7_TRAINING_A_MODEL.md&gt;https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_7_TRAINING_A_MODEL.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Only difference is I created my own ColumnCorpus and I dropped the batch_size to 16 and epochs to 5 while I'm trying to get it working.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows 10 64 bit
Version: flair 0.4.2
