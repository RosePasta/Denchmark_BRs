I trained a language model. This happens after I load an old saved checkpoint.
I am using Ubuntu 18.04
Flair version- 0.4.4
I think this error is related to this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/1087&gt;#1087&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I can confirm this, but I'm not sure it's about loading an old checkpoint.
In my case, the error occurs while loading a "final-model.pt", while I can correctly load a "checkpoint.pt" from the same training, made with v0.4.4.
Maybe we can't resume training from a final model? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alanakbik&gt;@alanakbik&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/anuragkumar95&gt;@anuragkumar95&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, were you able to find a solution to this? Running into the exact same problem.

		Example script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;`from flair.trainers import ModelTrainer
trainer = ModelTrainer.load_checkpoint('best-model.pt', corpus)

trainer.train(TRAIN_DIR,
              learning_rate=0.001,
              mini_batch_size=4,
              anneal_factor=0.5,
              patience=2,
              max_epochs=40,
              checkpoint=True) `
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Has best-model.pt checkpoint data or it is only a model?
AFAIK only checkpoint.pt files can be loaded with load_checkpoint; best-model or final-model are only model weights.

		Ahh you got it. However, I can't seem to find the checkpoint.pt file after training a sentence classifier. Do you know how I can output the checkpoint.pt files during training?

		Probably, there is no sense for checkpoint when training have finished correctly.
train(checkpoint=True)
