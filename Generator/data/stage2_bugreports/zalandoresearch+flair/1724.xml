	<summary>TransformerWordEmbeddings  Flair Release 0.5 cannot process special characters of Twitter data</summary>

Describe the bug
Traceback (most recent call last):

To Reproduce
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;data_folder = '/work/Twitter_data/'
embedding_type = 'bert-base-uncased'
corpus: Corpus = ColumnCorpus(data_folder, columns,
                              train_file='train-flair'
                              test_file='test-flair',
                              dev_file='dev-flair')
tag_type = 'pos'




tag_dictionary = corpus.make_tag_dictionary(tag_type=tag_type)
embeddings = TransformerWordEmbeddings(embedding_type,fine_tune=True)#layers="-1"

# 5. initialize sequence tagger
tagger: SequenceTagger = SequenceTagger(hidden_size=256,
                                    embeddings=embeddings,
                                    tag_dictionary=tag_dictionary,
                                    tag_type=tag_type,
                                    use_crf=False
                                    )

# 6. initialize trainer

trainer: ModelTrainer = ModelTrainer(tagger, corpus)#optimizer=Adam


trainer.train(path,
          learning_rate=0.1,
          embeddings_storage_mode = 'gpu',
          #mini_batch_chunk_size=2, 
          mini_batch_size=32,
          max_epochs=150) 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
expected training as usual with TransformerWordEmbeddings module but the error appears because TransformerWordEmbeddings module cannot process special characters of Twitter, not sure which exactly characters these are (kind of smilies and others). When used other data (not Twitter) without special characters, everything works fine.
Environment (please complete the following information):

Version flair-0.5

		I believe this is already fixed in the master branch and will be part of the upcoming release.

		Thank you for your answer. One more additional comment:
I saw: "&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/1703&gt;GH-1703&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: handle emojis in BERT."
However, there are still characters that cannot be processed, not only emojis.
These characters are '\ue04b', '\ue107','\U000fe04f', '\ue411', '\ue415', '\ue139'.

No, it does not work.
I removed these characters, i.e., '\ue04b', '\ue107', '\U000fe04f', '\ue411', '\ue415', '\ue139' and then everything works fine.

		This is strange. The characters seem to work for me:
text = 'this is ' + u'\ue04b' + ' !'

sentence = Sentence(text)

embeddings = TransformerWordEmbeddings('bert-base-uncased')
embeddings.embed(sentence)
for token in sentence:
    print(token.embedding)
Does this script run for you?

yes, this script works fine for me.
When I use TransformerDocumentEmbeddings and TextClassifier, everything works fine as well.
However, I have these problems only when I use SequenceTagger.

 can you update Flair? We just released 0.5.1 which hopefully fixes this.
