	<summary>Execution stop while trying to generate BERT embeddings</summary>
	<description>
I followed the same code in the tutorials for BERT embeddings. I used bert-base-cased model. I downloaded initially. After that it throws this issue and stops. Also my mac throws that python stopped unexpectedly.
dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _PySlice_Unpack

		Downgraded the torch version to 0.4.1 and it worked. But the version in requirements.txt is torch==1.0.0
Not sure why this issue occurred.
