	<summary>TypeError: function takes exactly 5 arguments (1 given) during CharLM training</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
As showen in the picture, I start the script to train my own CharLM forward embeddings and face this TypeError everytime at the same epoch(1) and same split (depends on the batch size) even with
Minimal Arguments like:
(hidden_size=128, nlayers=1, sequence_length=10, mini_batch_size=10, max_epochs=10, patience=25)
or
Big Arguments like:
(hidden_size=1024, nlayers=1, sequence_length=250, mini_batch_size=100, max_epochs=10, patience=25)
To Reproduce
from pathlib import Path
from flair.data import Dictionary
from flair.models import LanguageModel
from flair.trainers.language_model_trainer import LanguageModelTrainer, TextCorpus
import torch
is_forward_lm = True
dictionary: Dictionary = Dictionary.load('chars')
corpus = TextCorpus(Path(''),
dictionary,
is_forward_lm,
character_level=True)
language_model = LanguageModel(dictionary,
is_forward_lm,
hidden_size=1024,
nlayers=1)
torch.set_num_threads(6)
trainer = LanguageModelTrainer(language_model, corpus)
trainer.train(base_path='resources/taggers/language_model', sequence_length=250, mini_batch_size=100, checkpoint=True, patience=25)`

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Linux Ubuntu 18 server Version
Version: latest version 0.4.1

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/amrayach&gt;@amrayach&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
this error could be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/654&gt;#654&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Could you please check if you have no hidden files in your training folder ü§î You could just use find . -name ".*" for that üòÄ

 Thanks for your fast response I tried  and  and got no hidden files in my training Directory but I tried to change the general structure as you suggested in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/654&gt;#654&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and started the training again hope it'll resolve the issue, I will get back to you until I reach the point where the issue always occurs.

The suggested structure in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/654&gt;#654&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 did not work and the bug still exists and as I mentioned above there are no hidden files or folders in my training folder.

		Sorry this is not what actually fixed the bug. I drew the wrong conclusion.

The real problem was how I splitted the training file. I used split -C,
which seemed to produce some illegal inputs to flair. After changed to
split -l, it becomes OK.

 could you elaborate on your process on splitting your training data in a way that will not cause the error? I have the same problem but I can't get it to work. Thanks.

 try something like the following:
split -l 1000000 --numeric-suffixes corpus.txt train/train_split_

 Thanks a lot this:
split -l 1000000 --numeric-suffixes corpus.txt train/train_split_
worked for my case.
Cheers :D
