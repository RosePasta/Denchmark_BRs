	<summary>Loading checkpoint created with Flair0.4.5 fails in new Flair 0.5.1</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I have an old checkpoint file created with Flair 0.4.5 that i tried to load with Flair 0.5.1 and it fails
Mainly its due to the issue here in text_classification_model .. if i comment out the last two lines it works fine .. i suspect they probably don't exist in the old checkpoint ???
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def __str__(self):
    return super(flair.nn.Model, self).__str__().rstrip(')') + \
           f'  (beta): {self.beta}\n' + \
           f'  (weights): {self.weight_dict}\n' + \
           f'  (weight_tensor) {self.loss_weights}\n)'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		If this is not a supported usecase, do let me know.

		Also, it seems to me that label_type doesnt get added to state_dictionary. So that also creates problems down the line when checkpoint is finalized to a new model ...
