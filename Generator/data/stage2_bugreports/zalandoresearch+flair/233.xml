I am getting Getting IndexError:list index out of range error when I changed the dev_file=None
in
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;corpus: TaggedCorpus = NLPTaskDataFetcher.fetch_column_corpus(data_folder, columns,
                                                              train_file='train.txt',
                                                              test_file='test.txt',
                                                               dev_file=None)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am using custom dataset .
Also ,  What does __sample() method do in data_fetcher.py ?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Rishav09&gt;@Rishav09&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the __sample() method samples a dev data set from the train data. I realize now that the way this method is implemented can throw an error on small datasets, since we fixed the sample to always sample the same sentence ids. But if the dataset is small, an id may not exist which throws the error.
As a quick workaround for now, you could create a small dev dataset yourself and pass it to the method so that the error does not get thrown.
I think we need to fix this with a PR to change this method so that it does random sampling instead.
