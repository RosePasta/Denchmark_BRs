Describe the bug
TypeError: train() got multiple values for argument 'learning_rate'
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior (e.g. which model did you train? what parameters did you use? etc.).
from flair.data import Corpus
from flair.datasets import ColumnCorpus
from os.path import join, dirname

# Define columns
columns = {0: 'token', 1: 'label'}

# this is the folder in which train, test and dev files reside
base_dir = "/content/gdrive/My Drive/tagger/data"

# Instantiate corpus

                              train_file=join(base_dir, "mixed.conll"),
                              dev_file=join(base_dir, "mixed.conll"),   # will be dev?
                              test_file=join(base_dir, "mixed.conll"))  # will be test?   
tag_type = "label"
tag_dictionary = corpus.make_tag_dictionary(tag_type=tag_type)

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ericlief&gt;@ericlief&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - I think the problem is the line
 EvaluationMetric.MICRO_F1_SCORE,
which no longer is a parameter of the train method. Can you remove it and try again?
