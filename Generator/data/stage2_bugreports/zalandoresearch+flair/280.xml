	<summary>Language model training</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
with the latest  branch, training of a language model does not work. More precisely, the  class expects a -like object as training path (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair/blob/release-0.4/flair/trainers/language_model_trainer.py#L19&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). With a -like object the following comprehension won't work:
self.train_files = sorted(
    [f for f in self.train_path.iterdir() if (self.train_path / f).exists()])
-&gt; (self.train_path / f).exists() will always be empty, so the list of training files will be empty. I could temporarily fix it with using only f.exists() but then another error appeared.
It just want to mention this issue before the official 0.4 version is released :)
