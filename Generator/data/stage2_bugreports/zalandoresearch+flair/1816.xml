 Great work regarding the BioNLP corpora and models in flair 0.6! I just have one remark. The &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR_CORPORA.md&gt;https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR_CORPORA.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 references the FSU PrGe Corpus from the CalBc project which was not officially released in that form. There is now an updated publication and resource that exhibits more annotation levels and should be used in the future: &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.564.pdf&gt;http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.564.pdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for the great work, I will probably use some of those models in my own!

		Thanks for letting us know! We will add the ProGene Corpus and mention in the documentation of FSU PrGe that it was superseded by ProGene.
