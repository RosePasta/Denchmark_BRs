	<summary>CoNLL: docstart "sentences" are not filtered</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I just looked at the parsed sentences from a CoNLL corpus and it turns out, that the -DOCSTART- lines are not filtered:
In [1]: import flair.datasets                                                                                                                                                            

In [2]: corpus = flair.datasets.CONLL_03()

In [3]: corpus.train[0]                                                                                                                                                                  
Out[3]: Sentence: "-DOCSTART-" - 1 Tokens

In [4]: corpus.train[0].to_tagged_string()                                                                                                                                               
Out[4]: '-DOCSTART- &lt;-X-&gt;'

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stefan-it&gt;@stefan-it&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 yes we haven't filtered these sentences, but it would be easy to add. Given that these are currently just treated as one-word sentences without annotation, do you think filtering them is necessary?

		Initially I thought this could decrease f1 performance (using the .evaluate() method). But I filtered out these sentences and the f1 score is the same, so I think there's no need to filter them out :)
