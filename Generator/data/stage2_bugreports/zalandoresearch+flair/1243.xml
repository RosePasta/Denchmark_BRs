	<summary>Building wheel for dartsclone (setup.py) ... error during installation</summary>
	<description>
During execution of command line "pip instal flair" installation was unsuccesfull and "Building wheel for dartsclone (setup.py) ... error" message appeared.
I tried installing the flair in an anaconda environment with python3.6.9 and pytorch version 1.3.0.
Below is an image of the command prompt showing the error:

		Same problem with Windows 10. I tried python 3.6 and 3.7, the same issue. I tried to install dartsclone by itself, same error. I installed the C++ runtime also, but it made no difference... in fact, it caused more problems with the DLL, so I deleted it again.

		I found a way to fix it, here are the steps (for Windows 10):

download the offline installer vs_buildtools.exe from the link on this page: https://www.scivision.dev/python-windows-visual-c-14-required/
Follow the installation instructions from this page: https://maofeichen.com/misc/2019/06/20/python-windows-cpp-14-required.html
Restart Windows
Run Anaconda prompt: pip install dartsclone
Install Pytorch
Install flair

I had no more installation errors like this and I could import flair on my test code.

		Hi,
Facing this same issue on a Mac as well for Flair 0.4.4. Was previously on Flair 0.4.3 and ran into this error while trying to upgrade! Would be great to know if there is a fix for this.
