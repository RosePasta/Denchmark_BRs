		Awesome, I pretty much suspected this was happening. More evidence, the dev and test sets have the same scores/loss. Dev is being loaded twice. This would probably also explain when it complains about not being able to find the test loss.
Since this is so easy to fix, could you please just fix it in master ASAP?
Thanks anjapago for tracking down the actual problem. I haven't gotten around to tracking it down at this level yet.
