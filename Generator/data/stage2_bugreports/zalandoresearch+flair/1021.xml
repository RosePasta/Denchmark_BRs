	<summary>Flair embeddings are computed over tokenized string instead of original</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Flair embeddings in Sentence are computed over to_tokenized_string instead of to_plain_string. It is inconsistent with trained language model. Sometimes whitespaces are important.
Expected behavior
Flair embeddings in Sentence should be computed over to_plain_string.
Environment:

Version: flair-0.4.2


I have made the question here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/pull/72#issuecomment-523068227&gt;#72 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but an issue is more appropriate place.
