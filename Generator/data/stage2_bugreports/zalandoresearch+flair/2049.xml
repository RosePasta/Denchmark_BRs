	<summary>Unpickling error: wrong torch version.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The torch version described in requeirements.txt is 1.1.0, but I am facing the following error with torch version 1.3.0 while importing the en-sentiment model.
UnpicklingError: A load persistent id instruction was encountered, but no persistent_load function was specified.
To Reproduce

Force install torch==1.3.0
Run flair.models.TextClassifier.load("en-sentiment")

Expected behavior
The model should be loaded.

Please have a look at the following google colab notebook, which contains the traceback and also the fix for this issue.

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS [e.g. iOS, Linux]: Debian 9
Version [e.g. flair-0.3.2]: 0.7

Additional context
This issue can be fixed using torch version 1.5.0 or above, Should I submit a PR for it?
