	<summary>Keep newline in Sentence for sequence tagging prediction</summary>
	<description>

I'd like to keep the newline character  when doing sequence tagging prediction (keeping it during training seems easier because of the different code paths).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/flair/data.py#L605&gt;https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/flair/data.py#L605&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 This line removes the newline character after the text has been tokenised. Given that  is very flexible in terms of tokenisation, I think this last-minute modification of tokens is unwelcome. If I wanted to have run  on my tokens, I should have done it during tokenisation.
I understand I can replace \n with another unused character and then swap them back later but it'd be cleaner if we can avoid that.
To Reproduce
Sentence(["hello", "\n"]), not using a tokeniser because the text is already tokenised.
Expected behavior
I expect two tokens but I get only one.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Linux
Version: flair 0.7

		Many thanks for the quick response &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alanakbik&gt;@alanakbik&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. This really helps.
I noticed that  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/d66b016fa6d755f9016cab4efab5b7e75aaef721/flair/tokenization.py#L50&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 also has  hardcoded so changing the tokens given by spacy. I'm not sure whether you'd like to change this as well. It's much easier to handle thanks to the change you already made but might be unexpected if people don't step through the code.
