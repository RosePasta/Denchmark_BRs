	<summary>Token attribute "idx" not equal to position in sentence.</summary>
	<description>
Not sure if this is a bug or in some way a feature for later use of the token indices.
There was something going on with the  method in the Sentence class (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/107&gt;#107&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
Slicing the sentence returns the correct token:
Sentence("He likes apples .")[0] = Token: He
Anyway, the idx attribute of the token Token: He is 1.
Taking this index to retrieve the token from the sentence would yield Token: likes.
I would expect the token index to be equal to its position in the sentence (whilst starting to count from 0).
I'm running flair 0.6.1.post1.
If this behavior is not wanted, then probably the issue lies here:
Sentence.add_token(.):
# set token idx if not set
token.sentence = self
if token.idx is None:
    token.idx = len(self.tokens)
should be something like
# set token idx if not set
token.sentence = self
if token.idx is None:
    token.idx = len(self.tokens) - 1
Or do this before adding the token to self.tokens

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/daniellobrunello&gt;@daniellobrunello&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this is in fact intended to mirror the way token ids are usually given in linguistic annotation. For instance, the universal depedencies corpora always start counting at 1.
