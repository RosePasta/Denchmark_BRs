		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rohitmujumdar&gt;@rohitmujumdar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which OS are you on? Can you load the normal 'ner' or 'ner-fast' models?

		Hi Alan,
I am on Windows 8.1
Yes I could load the normal 'ner' and 'ner-fast' models successfully.

		It could be that there was an error when downloading the ner-ontonotes model. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/load-pretrained-model-error/11431&gt;https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/load-pretrained-model-error/11431&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you delete the model locally (stored locally in ~/flair/models/) and run the code again? This will trigger a new download. Also make sure that there is enough disk space.

		I tried deleting the model and re-downloading the model. I get the same error, in fact with the same storage size numbers.

		Having the same problem with ner-ontonotes 12 entity models on Windows. It might be actually a serialization related issue. Appreciate if someone could take a look and assist.

 thanks for reporting this! This probably is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/171&gt;#171&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so we will make sorting this out an immediate priority. Any help from Windows users debugging this is greatly appreciated!
