	<summary>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_regex</summary>
	<description>
Hello Flair team,
I used to use flair just fine on my old machine and created multiple models.
Now when I moved to my new machine,e I installed flair, and I'm trying to load a previous model, but I encountered an error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytorch_transformers'". So I pip install pytorch_transformers, then another error came up "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_regex'". I'm not sure how to solve it.
Please I need your help
Thank you
