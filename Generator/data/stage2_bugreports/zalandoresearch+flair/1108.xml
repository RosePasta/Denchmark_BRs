	<summary>find_learning_rate does not work anymore</summary>
	<description>

Before, I've run several experiments with which I could plot the optimal learning rate as in the tutorial. Now, after an upgrade of the codebase, I cannot anymore reproduce the same experiments.
What I find is similar to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/issues/986&gt;#986&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , but in my case the learning rate is never updated (while in the above issue is updated at least at the first step).

I've run the experiments with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/commit/24b72a6dfd1d0c2519794e1183cacc42c932c4f4&gt;24b72a6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  , and set a start lr of 1e-08 and an end lr of 1000, with 200 iterations. I get a tsv with 200 lines where the lr is always the same (slightly above the start lr).

I previously run the same experiments with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/commit/6c27431ecc731446f12bc3205bf68d0a859b9a8d&gt;6c27431&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and they seemed to work as in the tutorial. The lr in the tsv spanned all the interval specified.
