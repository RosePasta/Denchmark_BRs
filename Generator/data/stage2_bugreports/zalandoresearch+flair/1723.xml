	<summary>ELMoEmbeddings checkpoint pickling error with Flair0.4.5</summary>
	<description>
Google colab by default has torch 1.5.1 and when i install allennlp and try ELMoEmbedding after 1st epoch this error occurs. This occurs with Flair 0.5 and if i go back to Flair 0.4.5 this works just fine.
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/torch/serialization.py in _legacy_save(obj, f, pickle_module, pickle_protocol)
441     pickler = pickle_module.Pickler(f, protocol=pickle_protocol)
442     pickler.persistent_id = persistent_id
--&gt; 443     pickler.dump(obj)
444
445     serialized_storage_keys = sorted(serialized_storages.keys())
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'ELMoEmbeddings.init..'

		I believe this is already fixed in master branch, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/pull/1692&gt;#1692&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Will be part of the upcoming release.
