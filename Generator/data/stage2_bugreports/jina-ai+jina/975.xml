	<summary>HubIO not building images with base of local image</summary>
	<description>

When running unit tests for PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/pull/968&gt;#968&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, since communication layer has been changed, running even a dry run with a docker image running some old version of jina gives errors.
Then is where it is shown the need to change the image of jinaai/jina:devel to jinaai/jina:test-pip (Another question is if what we really have to test is the ability to obtain jinaai/jina:devel (if this is the case we have a little problem))
jinaai/jina:test-pip is created by our CI to have an image with the codebase that is being tested.
When this changes are applied, the tests of hubio still fail with a different message:
FAILED tests/unit/docker/test_hub_build.py::test_hub_build_pull - docker.errors.BuildError: manifest for jinaai/jina:test-pip not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
(Note that I have changed some names and paths for the tests)
But when I locally run :
docker build -f Dockerfile -t jinahub/pod.encoder.dummy_mwu_encoder:0.0.6 . inside the hub-mwu folder, the image is successfully built.
This last comment leads me to the conclusion that there is some discrepancy between hubio and the docker client.
