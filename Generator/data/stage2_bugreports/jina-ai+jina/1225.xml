	<summary>[KNOWN ISSUE] ContainerPea communication broken in 2-level docker</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
ContainerPea is a Pea which is responsible to spin up a BasePea running inside a docker image throught Docker SDK.
In general, the BasePea is capable of receiving control requests from the host ContainerPea if it works on a host machine, but not if this host is running inside a docker container itself.
This is for now a limitation, Is there a way to enable communication to a docker image inside another docker that does not involve running dind?
