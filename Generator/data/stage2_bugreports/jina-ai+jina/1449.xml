	<summary>PyClientRunTime timeout is not enough (maybe needs to be configurable)</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
PyClientRuntime has a timeout before it shuts down of 10 seconds.
This is not enough to wait for the 1st search request to a FaissIndexer, where the FaissIndex is actually built in memory.
