this issue is not solved

This issue was thought to be solved at syntax sugar level. it is very hard to adapt to the exact Flow the user will be using and keep a universal solution.
Because also you would override SilceQL that may exist in the middle of the Flow, which in my opinion makes for a more dangerous solution than the problem we are trying to fix
