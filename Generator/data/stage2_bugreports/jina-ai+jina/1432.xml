	<summary>NumpyIndexer returning [nan, nan, nan] distances</summary>
	<description>

When running  for PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/issues/1431&gt;#1431&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and investigating why the test fails, it shows that the  is returning when top_k is larger than  a lot of [nan, nan, nan] distances.
It needs to be investigated and taken care of

		I think it is expected; cosine distance is not defined for 1D vectors
