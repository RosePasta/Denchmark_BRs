	<summary>Pod's driver is overwritten in pub-sub connection</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
PublishDriver is used to modify the num_parts when the pod is connect to another by the PUB-SUB connection. However, PublishDriver overwrites the original driver of the pod.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;first.tail_args.yaml_path = '- !!PublishDriver | {num_part: %d}' % first.tail_args.num_part
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe how you solve it
Append the PublishDriver to the yaml_path instead of overwriting.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Environment

		I don't understand, what is the original driver of the pod? Can you give a flow example where this is affected?
