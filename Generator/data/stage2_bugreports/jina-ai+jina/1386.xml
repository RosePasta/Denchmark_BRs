	<summary>Add a method to guarantee that callback is called when testing</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
We have many tests that run assertions at the callback of Flow outputs.
This is dangerous because it can easily lead to false positives!
We need to add in the conftest.py a fixture that guarantees that it can be used to automatically ensure it is called (and the rest of the asserts are run)
