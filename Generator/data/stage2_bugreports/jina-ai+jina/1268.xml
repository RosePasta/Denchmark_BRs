	<summary>Incremental indexing broken, related to metas names and compoundExecutor</summary>

Describe the bug
This is a bug that has been found trying to build an example using Incremental Indexing.
We saw that the integration tests did not show the expected behavior of the feature, because the Flow was never closed before trying to index more documents (which is the intended behavior).
We tried to fix the issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/pull/1267&gt;#1267&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but we saw that in many tests we have this exception:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19825685/98841600-a2a68780-2448-11eb-9b07-e377c5902b77.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After investigation I saw what is the problem.
When building an index from its .bin dump, add some point this is called (Print stacktrace to the call):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/home/joan/jina/jina/jina/executors/compound.py", line 308, in _set_routes
    for m, _ in inspect.getmembers(c, predicate=inspect.ismethod):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.7/inspect.py", line 341, in getmembers
    value = getattr(object, key)
  File "/home/joan/jina/jina/jina/helper.py", line 668, in __get__
    value = obj.__dict__[f'CACHED_{self.func.__name__}'] = self.func(obj)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The problem is that we are trying to access every cached_property of the executors because of this CompoundExecutor inspection.
What this does is rebuilds the cached_properties functions if exists by calling the function. In the VectorIndexer case what it does is call the query_handler, this query_handler since it has indexed data, sets the is_handler_loaded to True.
What this does is that when later the indexer tries to get the write_handler, it is never obtained because it considers that the indexer is in QUERY mode, and since it is forbidden for indexers other than the DocIDCache to be in both QUERY and WRITE mode, it returns None and this error appears.
