	<summary>crash when sharding without batching</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When attempting to upgrade the multires lyrics examples to use sharding, I encountered a bug that produced the following error at query time:

See discussion and experiments in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jina-ai/examples/pull/271&gt;this PR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The problem seems to be as follows.

We should inform users that if they use sharding, they need to use batching.
If a shard is empty, is should still return an empty list of results.

Describe how you solve it
In order to fix this, we need to use batching. See ex. v3 in the PR above.

		Here the issue is that when batch_size is larger than the size of the data, the load balancer in HeadPea does not send any data to that shard, leaving this shard empty. (That is for me not an issue).
The thing is we need to decide what to do when a shard is empty (I think the indexer should be robust to not having any data and maybe just raise a warning that the index in that shard is empty.
Note
When I talk about shard is to understand each other, but ideally a Pea , driver or executor should be unaware of them being a shard (at least for now).
Wrap up
Need to make Indexers and SearchDrivers (robust to having no documents) indexed and just return no matches. (Most of the effort should be make on testing and integration testing).
