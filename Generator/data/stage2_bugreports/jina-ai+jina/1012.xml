	<summary>Executor logger does not get parameters from Pea (no log_sse can be activated for Executors)</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Since logger in Executor is instantiated by just giving the name as parameter, it can't receive log_sse parameter and therefore will never pass the logs to be processed by the Dashboard.
Solutions possible:

Proper forwarding the parameter.
Access Pea's logger from the Drivers logger (which is a property accessing the pea's)
