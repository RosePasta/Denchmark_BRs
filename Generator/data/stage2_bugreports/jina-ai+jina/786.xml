		Hello,
I think the problem comes from the fact that "pwd" is a valid Unix command to access current directory, but it is not valid in Windows. So your solution is exactly what the command intends to do.

		Yes, you are right.&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JoanFM&gt;@JoanFM&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/helloworld/index.html&gt;https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/helloworld/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I did not realize that "pwd " is not applicable on windows.
So I filed this issue. The purpose is to remind windows users to pay attention when using this command.
