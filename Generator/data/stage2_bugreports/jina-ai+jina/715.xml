	<summary>BaseRecursiveDriver does not count depth correctly</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/pull/714&gt;#714&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes several bugs in drivers and refactors  using recursive structure.
However, _wrap(self.req.docs, *args, **kwargs) -&gt; _postorder_apply  does not work correctly with KVSearchDriver due to the depth of matches is misaligned.
The temp solution is having depth_range set to [0,1] for KVSearchDriver, but this then override the query docs due to apply_all works on both level 1 (the matches) and level 0 the query docs.
To reproduce, run jina hello-world on master and you will see the query docs are overrided to the indexed docs with the same id.
