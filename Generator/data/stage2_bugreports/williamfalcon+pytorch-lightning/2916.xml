&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When training on multiple nodes using  with custom , it will raise  caused by the following line of code: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/97e6f35b34437c89d422bd440dca4a8d2c4d5a9f/pytorch_lightning/callbacks/model_checkpoint.py#L127&gt;model_checkpoint.py#L127&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Maybe a try-except block is needed?

 I found a few issues with the model checkpoint path stuff. Not 100% sure I found the particular bug you were seeing but I think this should fix it. Can you give my branch in the above PR a test? Sorry to have introduced this bug for you.

		Sorry for the late reply, but it seems that this bug has not been fully fixed. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/ee72271d205beb2c012e34425cb16e189cc56c7d/pytorch_lightning/utilities/cloud_io.py#L88&gt;This line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 still raises an exception:   when training with DDP. I still need to manually add a  to ignore the exception.

 That line has been completely replaced now on master. Can you give it another try. I hope &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/3320&gt;#3320&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  has finally resolved this.
