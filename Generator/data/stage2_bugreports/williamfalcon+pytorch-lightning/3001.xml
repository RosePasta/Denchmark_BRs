	<summary>ModelCheckpoint does not create full path</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint('my/path/')
Only my folder is created.
I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pytorch_lightning/callbacks/model_checkpoint.py#L126&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 discard the last trailing slash. So the directories are not created as intended when the paths are getting split.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Path should be fully created.

		I do not think that the trailing slash is the root problem. We also want that "my/path" should be interpreted as a path to a folder.
I think a reasonable fix is to force the user to provide the extension when they want a file. This way, we can easily differentiate between folders and files.

		how about having two parameters, dirpath and filename? dirpath should be required (or maybe default to '.') and filename can be optional?

		I don't think we can make it required, because we have default_root_dir in Trainer, which should work as expected.

 I mean trailing slash isn't the problem, discarding the last trailing slash is the problem.

		yeah it can be optional, no problem

		but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ydcjeff&gt;@ydcjeff&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it should work with both 'my/path/' and 'my/path'.

		I think what jeff wants to say is that
path, filename = os.path.split("a/b/c") 
vs.
path, filename = os.path.split("a/b/c/")
in the former, filename = "c", and in the latter filename = ""

		yes, it's that.
When we give filepath=mnist/ckpt/ or filepath=mnist/ckpt, os.path.realpath() outputs mnist/ckpt
and when we do splitting, it becomes like path=mnist and filename=ckpt

		I think separate parameters dirpath and filename would be more flexible for the user. Not sure if it will break any backward compatibility with other parameters from Trainer or logger.

		let's discuss it on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/3583&gt;#3583&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The approach suggested there will solve this issue.
