	<summary>Bug in `LightningModule.load_from_checkpoint`</summary>
	<description>
Suppose you have a class Model(LightningModule) (a LightningModule subclass) and as parameters it takes
params: argparse.Namespace (without a default value), along with other keyword arguments which might take default arguments. Loading from a checkpoint
model = Model(params=params, **kwargs)
...  # saves a checkpoint
model = Model.load_from_checkpoint(params=params, **kwargs)  
# same behavior arises if params is passed as positional argument
will throw the error TypeError: __init__() got multiple values for argument 'params'.
This comes from the fact that in line 205 in pytorch_lightning/core/saving.py
model = cls(*cls_args, **cls_kwargs)
when inspected, cls_args is ({'params': params},) and cls_kwargs is, of course, {'params': params}.
This stems from the fact in lines 189-196 (in saving.py):
            if args_name == 'kwargs':
                # in case the class cannot take any extra argument filter only the possible
                cls_kwargs.update(**model_args)
            elif args_name:
                if args_name in cls_init_args_name:
                    cls_kwargs.update({args_name: model_args})
            else:
                cls_args = (model_args,) + cls_args
the else clause is getting called and model_args contains a copy of kwargs!
To be honest, it's very unclear to me exactly what model_args is supposed to be here, but what is clear is that
this block needs more checking so that we don't just stick copies of items in cls_kwargs into cls_args. Just doing
something silly like replacing the else clause with
from typing import Sequence
...
             elif isinstance(model_args, Sequence):
                cls_args = tuple(model_args) + cls_args
fixes the problem for me, but as I said, I'm unclear on exactly how model_args is being used, so I'm sure there is a better
solution.
