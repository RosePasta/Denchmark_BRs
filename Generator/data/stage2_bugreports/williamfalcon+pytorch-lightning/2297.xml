	<summary>If a path to folder which wasn't created yet is set as filepath in ModelCheckpoint, the folder isn't created.</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This pull request changed the behavior of :
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/2153&gt;#2153&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Now it looks like this:
if os.path.isdir(filepath):
    self.dirpath, self.filename = filepath, '{epoch}'
else:
    filepath = os.path.realpath(filepath)
    self.dirpath, self.filename = os.path.split(filepath)
os.makedirs(self.dirpath, exist_ok=True)
Theoretically, if filepath is a directory, it should make self.dirpath be equal to filepath, and if filepath is a path to file, then self.dirpath is a part of the defined filepath
But in fact, if the defined directory wasn't created yet (for example I want separate folder for each run), then os.path.isdir(filepath) is False and filepath is treated like a filename and is splitted.
For example, I set saved_models as a filepath.
After os.realpath it turns into something like path_to_run_dir/saved_models
Then we have this line: self.dirpath, self.filename = os.path.split(filepath)
And as a result self.dirpath is equal to path_to_run_dir

		I think this is the expected behavior. You pass something like path/to/some_random_name which doesn't exist. PL considers some_random_name as the filename.
