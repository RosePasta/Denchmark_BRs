	<summary>Error when model checkpoint and no early stop</summary>
	<description>

When creating a , if we set a  and  we get an error at this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pytorch_lightning/trainer/trainer_io.py#L157&gt;line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 here.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create a ckpt = ModelCheckpoint(...)
Create a Trainer
Setting checkpoint_callback = ckpt and early_stop_callback=False
See the error AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'wait'

Expected behavior
It should be possible to save the model without setting an EarlyStopping condition. Of course one could set an EarlyStopping with the max integer, but changing the condition from an or to an and solves the problem.
