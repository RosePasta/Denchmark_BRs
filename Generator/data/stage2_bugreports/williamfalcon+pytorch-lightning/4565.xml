	<summary>progress bar refresh_rate prevents old bars being cleared</summary>
	<description>
If you set refresh_rate=100 then the sanity check and validation bars continue being displayed forever even though leave=False. Also the validation bars only show part complete.
I note also that the mininterval parameter for tqdm bars is ignored.

		In which terminal emulator / environment did you observe this behavior?
Can you verify it with our bug report model?

		In a jupyter notebook but likely will be same in any environment. If possible would be simpler to use tqdm for all the progress bar code rather than having a bespoke "refresh" mechanism. It gets to the progress point that should be the end of the bar but does not update it any more.

		works fine as long as the refresh is every iteration so bug is probably in the lightning refresh mechanism.
