	<summary>Fix pipy badges and images not rendering</summary>
	<description>
it seems that it did not work for &lt;denchmark-link:https://dustingram.com/articles/2018/03/16/markdown-descriptions-on-pypi/&gt;PyPI page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

see our RC - &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/pytorch-lightning/1.1.0rc1&gt;https://pypi.org/project/pytorch-lightning/1.1.0rc1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

when I open the PKG-INFO I still see the original paths...
Downloaded implemented in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/4250&gt;#4250&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you still need some help, I can look into it.

		No similar experience but happy to dive in and learn. I might take some time getting up to speed (just like the checkpoint issue) so if it is very urgent, feel free to skip over me :]

		seems we would need to upload the images somewhere on a cloud... &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/46875147/4521646&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/46875147/4521646&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Or as an asset of this repo and just use the raw github link

		yes, but as we download them during package build time there are not in any git version (just on the fly) so we would need to upload them to some free public domain and refer them there...
so, yes, we can put a hard link to the images but not budges... :/ &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/5246#issuecomment-739895844&gt;pypa/warehouse#5246 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

well, let's try to upload it as assets and refer from the given path :]
