  looks like the new hparams saving fails with ddp/ddp2

		I'm having trouble reproducing this. I'm running
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python gpu_template.py  --gpus 2 --distributed_backend ddp
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

on a single node with 2 GPUs (I've locally reverted your patch that catches the error). That runs fine, and I'm able to see that hparams are saved to the checkpoint by loading it manually.
I even tried replacing the ArgumentParser with a HyperOptArgumentParser, but everything still works. Can you share any more details about what you were doing to get this error?
