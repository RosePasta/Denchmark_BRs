	<summary>Using `terminate_on_nan=True` on TPU leads to huge slowdowns</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using trainer = Trainer(terminate_on_nan=True, ...) leads to calling TrainerTrainingTricksMixin().detect_nan_tensors(), which is very slow on TPU. About 5x slower forward passes for resnet50 scale nets.
Should maybe raise a warning if using TPUs and terminate_on_nan.

		yes terminate on nan always leads to a slow down, also for GPU and CPU not just TPU. I don't see a way to speed it up, and it's not clear to me why it is a bug?
It should only be used for debugging.

		Seemed pretty fast on GPU, but OK. No need to speed it up but a warning would be nice.
