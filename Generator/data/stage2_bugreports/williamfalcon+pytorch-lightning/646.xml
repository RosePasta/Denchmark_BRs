	<summary>Turn off validation if val_percent_check=0</summary>
	<description>
As was suggested by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon&gt;@williamFalcon&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/536#issuecomment-558115605&gt;#536 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  should turn off the validation loop. But now it will not work because of
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; self.num_val_batches = max(1, self.num_val_batches)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So I suggest to fix it. Moreover I suggest to make more thorough processing of train_percent_check and val_check_interval:

We should require all *_percent_check and val_check_interval to be in the range [0.0; 1.0].
Final num_val_batches can be equal to 0 that will effectively disable validation.
Final num_train_batches and num_test_batches should be at least 1. (See also #631)
Final val_check_interval should be at least 1.
The user can try to turn off validation by setting val_check_interval to a big value. Maybe in that case we should print a helpful message that validation can be turned off by setting val_percent_check=0.

Any thoughts?

		One question, why should *_percent_check be in range [0, 1]. You mean [0, 100]? As the name suggests, it should be a percentage.

		Yeah, you are right, the naming is not correct. It is not real percents but just fractions. So now it is assumed that 1. means to use the whole dataset.

		This behavior seems to be absent in the documentation?
