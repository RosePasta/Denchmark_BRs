	<summary>Errata in the readme?</summary>
	<description>
In the MNIST example in the readme, the functions tng_dataloader, val_dataloader, and test_dataloader return the same object. I think that at least for test, the train flag used to create the MNIST object should be False. I am not aware of how to extract automatically a validation dataset from the MNIST dataloader in torch.

		nah, it’s just for illustration and simplicity only. mnist has no val set. in the real world you’d split the train portion into a train/val split by subclassing the mnist dataset.
the readme is to illustrate the main ideas
