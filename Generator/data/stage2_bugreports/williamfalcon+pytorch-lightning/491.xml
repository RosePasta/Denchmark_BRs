	<summary>IterableDataset breaks 1.1 compatibility</summary>
	<description>
A recently introduced feature unfortunately breaks compability with Pytorch 1.1.0.

IterableDataset support, introduced in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/issues/323&gt;issue 323&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, requires Pytorch 1.2.0+.
To Reproduce
In a python environment with Pytorch 1.1.0 do:
import pytorch_lightning

Compatibility with Pytorch 1.1.0. I'm filing it as a bug report rather than a docs fix since the dependency on 1.2.0+ introduced by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/issues/323&gt;issue 323&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 doesn't seem to be intentional.

		I have played with versions and it seems to me that it does not run even with 1.2.0; see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/462&gt;#462&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		weird. letâ€™s patch it and make a nee release? in the meantime, put a note on the readme to use 0.5.2.1 if you need pt 1.1 or 1.2 support?

		you may rather change requirements.txt and after fix put it back...
I see that &gt;=1.2.0 is there already for some time... 8-)

		Is this already fixed? I see that torch 1.2.0 is already in requirements.txt ?
