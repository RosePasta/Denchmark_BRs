	<summary>Is it a bug or a feature that validating starts before training ends?</summary>
	<description>
pytorch-lightning version:0.7.5
1 gpu.
I found that validating started when training reached near end(about 98%), then training and validating run simultaneously.
Anyone ever noticed this?
I guess validating should start after training loop ends in every epoch. Am I wrong?
