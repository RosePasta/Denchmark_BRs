&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

run_evaluation() does not work. Suspected that model is not loaded into the trainer at any point.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run ImageNet example with --evaluate argument. python imagenet_example.py --evaluate

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Model is supposed to load from the checkpoint directory and evaluation on validation is carried out.

 the ImageNet example uses the wrong method.  only works when at least 1 epoch of training is used.  should be used instead. Also I'm working on a pull request to separate  and  since in cases like ImageNet, there's no test set or in the event that user will want to evaluate on validation set only.

 I now realize  is a private method... it's not intended to be used directly by the user.

		misunderstanding was caused by imagenet example using run_evaluation()

		Are there any updates on this? The separation of .validate and .test seems very useful.
