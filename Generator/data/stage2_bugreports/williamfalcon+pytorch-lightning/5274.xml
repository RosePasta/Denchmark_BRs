	<summary>Loading checkpoint creates new logging directory and tries to load checkpoint from that directory</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm doing training and then loading the checkpoint later to do some experiments.  I'm using hydra.  What's happening is the checkpoints are being created as expected.  However, after I load the checkpoint with load_from_checkpoint a new output directory is created, and the checkpoint attempting to be read from that new output directory (and so of course it can't find it).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if cfg.train is True :
        trainer = Trainer(max_epochs=cfg.max_epochs, gpus=cfg.gpus)
        model = Net(cfg)
        trainer.fit(model)
        trainer.test(model)
    else :
        # plot some data
        model = Net.load_from_checkpoint(cfg.checkpoint)
        model.eval()
        ...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi, could you help us reproduce this with the minimal bug report model found in the pl_examples folder? The load_from_checkpoint function does not create new directories by itself, so there must be some other code in your case that creates this. When you use the Trainer.test method make sure to pass in the loaded model, otherwise it will attempt to load one.

		Turns out you need the full path otherwise it tries to load from a new path that it creates.  Not sure if this is just with Hydra or not.
