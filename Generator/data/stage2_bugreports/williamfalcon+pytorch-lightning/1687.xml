		Did you try to install ipywidgets?

		Isn't it only tqdm.auto which uses ipywidgets to display a progress bar? That we only use here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/search?q=tqdm.auto&amp;unscoped_q=tqdm.auto&gt;https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/search?q=tqdm.auto&amp;unscoped_q=tqdm.auto&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Maybe it should be changed in tqdm.auto to not take IProgess if ipywidgets is not installed. There are already some checks:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/autonotebook.py&gt;https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/blob/master/tqdm/autonotebook.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I had a similar problem when using jupyter lab and I had to install nodejs for it (which I wanted to avoid) but found no way of disable tqdm.auto taking IProgress. In my case it didn't crashed but no progress bar were displayed. If someone knows a way of overwriting the tqdm.auto selection let me know. Otherwise I think the checks should be better or there should be a way of overwriting the tqdm.auto selection. (In my opinion)

		I am doing:
from tqdm import tqdm
and it seems to work.
In addition I had to install ipywidgets.
Perhaps pytorch-lightning should depend on ipywidgets? It seems like jupyter is a pretty common use case for people.

		I do not think we want to add  as dependency bu we can do similar check on our side too
