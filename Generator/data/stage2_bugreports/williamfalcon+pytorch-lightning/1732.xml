	<summary>Unexpected behavior: `model.train()` is not called without validation loop</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The lightning module's  method is never called unless validation is implemented. This causes issue with e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/domain_templates/computer_vision_fine_tuning.py&gt;the new transfer learning example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where the  is overridden and used to freeze layers. It only works with a validation loop. (Note that the example linked above did an equivalent of  in )
I don't think this behavior is documented.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run this google colab:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10aoFWAaOE-Epm88Io9bHxgsIfHGhr8cS&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10aoFWAaOE-Epm88Io9bHxgsIfHGhr8cS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And it would show that CoolSystemNoVal does not call .train(), only CoolSystemWithVal does.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

.train() called no matter for CoolSystemNoVal or CoolSystemWithVal
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It's google colab.
