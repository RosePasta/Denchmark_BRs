	<summary>Using distributed_backend='dp' causes result.write to fail</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Saving results with result.write is broken up DP distributed training.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Perform something like this
result.write('blah', ['one', 'two', 'three']
in a test_step and run with distributed_backend='dp', PTL will then call into Result.dp_reduce and try to run
self[k] = value.mean(dim=-1) where value is the predictions dictionary which will subsequently fail.

		0.9.0, sorry, should have put that in the original issue.

		hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/willprice&gt;@willprice&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! We updated our API to use self.write instead of results objects, that should simplify things.
Can you try upgrading to 1.0.2 to see if issue presists?
