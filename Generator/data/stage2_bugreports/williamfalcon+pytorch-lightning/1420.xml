	<summary>Gym missing from requirements.txt?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;🐛 Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running bash .run_local_tests.sh, I get an error that import gym failed. I solved this using pip install gym, but this package might need to be added to the requirements?
Wasn't sure exactly where this would belong (seems test specific), but would be a quick PR.

		I think gym is a very specific to the test and is not a part of the framework. We might want to separate what is essential for the package and testing.

		gym is part of the test requirements not the framework requirements.
