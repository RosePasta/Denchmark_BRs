	<summary>Checkpoint saving isn't atomic</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Saving checkpoints happens non-atomically. In some cases, this causes an incomplete write of a checkpoint (for example when receiving a SIGKILL during writing), causing any subsequent loading to fail with
RuntimeError: unexpected EOF, expected 8 more bytes. The file might be corrupted.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is difficult to reproduce, since it relies on timing outside of code. For me, it happens with fast-running models that run at ~1-4 seconds per epoch.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Checkpointing should be resistant to such issues, and instead simply continue as-is.
