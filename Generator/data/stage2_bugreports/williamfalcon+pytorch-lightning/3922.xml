	<summary>UserWarning for testing_epoch_end in 0.9.1rc4</summary>
	<description>
Just informing about the user warning I was displayed:
YYY\anaconda3\envs\pt_cpu\lib\site-packages\pytorch_lightning\utilities\distributed.py:37: UserWarning: The testing_epoch_end should not return anything as of 9.1.to log, use self.log(...) or self.write(...) directly in the LightningModule warnings.warn(*args, **kwargs)
although I don't have the testing_epoch_end method in my class. UPDATE: The warning does not appear when I implement it.
I'm using 0.9.1rc4.
If it's being resolved elsewhere and I missed that, feel free to close the issue.

 it seems as there is a missing check if the method is overwritten, mind sends a PR?
