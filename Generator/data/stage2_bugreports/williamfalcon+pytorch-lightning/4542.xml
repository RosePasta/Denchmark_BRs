	<summary>Replace AttributeDict in with dict in checkpoint</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;ðŸš€ Feature&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When we save hyperparameters to the checkpoint, we save them in a Lightning datastructure called AttributeDict.
We should replace this with a regular dict when saving the checkpoint.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Allows loading checkpoints with torch.load in environments where Lightning is not installed.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Pitch&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Convert AttributeDict to dict when saving, convert dict to AttributeDict when loading.

		wasn't this resolved here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/2653&gt;#2653&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

maybe someone changed it again.

		thanks for pointing to the linked pr. A week ago I inspected the checkpoint and the type was AttributeDict.
I will check again

		Yeah this is odd, last I tested it was loading fine (without pl) as well... though there has been quite a bit of refactoring...
Edit:
relevant code block is here now and seems fine: 


pytorch-lightning/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/checkpoint_connector.py


         Line 334
      in
      4f3160b






 checkpoint[LightningModule.CHECKPOINT_HYPER_PARAMS_KEY] = dict(model.hparams)

		aha, but that means the logic there with omegaconf is making it break. because even when omegaconf is  installed but not used, we have the attribute dict in the checkpoint.

		oh I did not realize OMEGACONF_AVAILABLE is only checking if it's installed...
