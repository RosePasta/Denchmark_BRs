	<summary>User Deprecation Warning thrown even if user does not override `validation_epoch_end`</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

From &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/3789&gt;#3789&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 additional context. If the user does not override  a warning is still thrown reading: 
I tracked this down to this snippet:



pytorch-lightning/pytorch_lightning/trainer/evaluation_loop.py


        Lines 197 to 222
      in
      0c12065






 eval_results = outputs 



 if num_dataloaders == 1: 



 eval_results = outputs[0] 



 



 user_reduced = False 



 



 if self.testing: 



 if is_overridden('test_epoch_end', model=model): 



 model._current_fx_name = 'test_epoch_end' 



 if using_eval_result: 



 eval_results = self.__gather_epoch_end_eval_results(outputs) 



 



 eval_results = model.test_epoch_end(eval_results) 



 user_reduced = True 



 



 else: 



 if is_overridden('validation_epoch_end', model=model): 



 model._current_fx_name = 'validation_epoch_end' 



 if using_eval_result: 



 eval_results = self.__gather_epoch_end_eval_results(outputs) 



 



 eval_results = model.validation_epoch_end(eval_results) 



 user_reduced = True 



 



 # depre warning 



 if eval_results is not None: 





The problem is that eval_results contains the outputs if validation_epoch_end is not overriden by the user. I believe the test in line 222 should be updated to
if eval_results is not None and user_reduced is True:
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run a model without overriding validation_epoch_end and have a single eval data loader.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No user warning should be thrown if the user hasn't overriden  validation_epoch_end

Could have issued a PR if this seems okay but got the message there is a freeze on PRs.

This is definitely not addressed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/3800&gt;#3800&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I pulled and retested. I also don't see why it should, since the problem is in a different place than what either of the two referenced PRs address.
Like I mentioned in the original report, the cause is that the warning should be thrown only if the user has attempted to reduce validation_step outputs in validation_epoch_end and returned something explicitly. The problem is that only eval_results is being checked, which is set to hold the output even if the user hasn't overriden  validation_epoch_end.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The solution is to replace line 222 in the file evaluation_loop with the following:
if eval_results is not None and user_reduced is True:
instead of
if eval_results is not None:
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Would have been happy to issue a PR but I can't, but please don't close this one on account of the referenced PRs, they do not address the core problem, which is a faulty check.
