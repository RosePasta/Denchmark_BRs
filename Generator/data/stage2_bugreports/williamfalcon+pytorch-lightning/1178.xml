	<summary>DeprecatedWarnings when loaded</summary>
	<description>
Ubuntu 19.10, Python 3.7.5, pytorch 1.4.0, venv, installed with pip3
Builds based on clones of master after ~3/14 may issue DeprecationWarnings when loaded. This occurs if built within venv environment with include-system-site-packages = true or built outside venv. It does not occur if include-system-site-packages = false, or if using earlier repo clone.
This is a fresh ubuntu install, and the only python packages installed are in support of ml work - pytorch, pytorch-lightning, numpy, sci-py, tensorflow, etc.
The errors:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/home/seth/dev/pytorch_work/.venv.ptl.master/lib/python3.7/site-packages/graphql/type/directives.py:55: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3,and in 3.9 it will stop working
  assert isinstance(locations, collections.Iterable), 'Must provide locations for directive.'
/home/seth/dev/pytorch_work/.venv.ptl.master/lib/python3.7/site-packages/graphql/type/typemap.py:1: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3,and in 3.9 it will stop working
  from collections import OrderedDict, Sequence, defaultdict
/home/seth/dev/pytorch_work/.venv.ptl.master/lib/python3.7/site-packages/trains/backend_interface/metrics/events.py:27: DeprecationWarning: The usage of `cmp` is deprecated and will be removed on or after 2021-06-01.  Please use `eq` and `order` instead.
  @attr.attrs(cmp=False, slots=True)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Seems like this might be due to new code that depend on newer versions of installed packages, so here is pip3 freeze outside of venv:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;numpy==1.18.1
Pillow==6.1.0
torch==1.4.0
torchvision==0.5.0
tqdm==4.43.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		could you please give full error trace?
so far I see only  error which is third-party lib...
maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bmartinn&gt;@bmartinn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could help...

		That is the full  trace. Three warnings come up - 2 for graphql, 1 for trace. Both 3rd party libs. The reason I raised the question is that they did not start appearing until repo clones after ~march 14. I haven't changed the environment ...
Can you see all 3 - I can see them here.

		that is about the time we have added Trains...

 , I can probably take care of the warning inside the Trains package, but as you mentioned those are 3rd party libraries...

Moreover  had no "eq" argument in previous versions, and I would hate to bump the minimum  version in the Trains requirements ...

		If its not due to new ptl code making an error or using the wrong version of something, it seems like this is at most a release note - easy for users to mask with a filter. Shall we close?
FYI - just noticed that for some reason the whole freeze list does not show. Don't know why you would need it at this point, but ask if you do ...

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bmartinn&gt;@bmartinn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 kind of extreme case would be using some warning ignore?

 Doable, but this is a Trains/GraphQL repository issue, don't you think?

		fwiw - i think ptl should let the warnings stand if they are not due to some 'mis-behavior' in ptl.  they are easily screened by a warning filter in user code and if trains doesn't fix them before they become fatal at least user will know.
