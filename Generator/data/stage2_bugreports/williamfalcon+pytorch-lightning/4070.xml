	<summary>MNIST example throwing error "you tried to log -1 which is not currently supported. Try a dict or a scalar/tensor."</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I had to re-install my environment and now my code is breaking at trainer.fit() with the error:

I also tried the MNIST example that can be found &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/basic_examples/mnist.py&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the same error.
I started off with a clean environment and installed Lightning using . As a result I'm using torch 1.6.0+cu101 and lightning 0.10.0. I'm not passing any arguments.
Thanks

		Thanks for reporting.
Please post the full stack trace so we know if this is coming from TensorBoard logger or something else.
The mnist example runs without problems for me.

		could you reproduce using boring model or a colab?
That exception was hiding a broader exception which has now been chained on master.
