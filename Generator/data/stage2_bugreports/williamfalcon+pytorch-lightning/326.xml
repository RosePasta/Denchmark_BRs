	<summary>Broken link in Examples readme</summary>
	<description>
The link to the template at the top of &lt;denchmark-link:https://williamfalcon.github.io/pytorch-lightning/examples/Examples/&gt;https://williamfalcon.github.io/pytorch-lightning/examples/Examples/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 doesn't work. Seems like the underlying codebase has shifted and the doc wasn't yet updated.
