	<summary>Trainer.test() returns type error while loading model after upgrading from pl 0.76 to 0.8 and 0.82dev</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am running a Transformer model with a custom data set. Everything worked fine with v0.76, except for early stopping. However after upgrading to v0.8+ Trainer.test() would return type error while loading model (expected int but got dict). I have tried two different datasets with the same model which returned same results. I have downgraded back to v0.76 and Trainer.test() was able to run, but earlystopping would not work properly.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code sample&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

trainer.test()
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Trainer.test() should run model.test_step without error

		I think this should have been fixed. Could you try master branch?
