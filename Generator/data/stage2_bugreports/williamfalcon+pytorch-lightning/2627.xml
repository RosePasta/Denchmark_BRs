On every Epoch I've started seeing the following message (model code unchanged)
Trainer was signaled to stop but required minimum epochs (100) or minimum steps (None) has not been met. Training will continue... 
Any ideas what would cause this? I'm testing Ubuntu 20.04, this resulted in the upgrade of vscode (the trainer is running in the vscode terminal)  so either of those could be the cause for the change - and in the process, I suspect my cuda and pytorch versions have changed so it pretty much could be anything.
Other than the message everything appears to be working though.
Jut wondering if this is a known issue or it's just a result of being on the bleeding edge?

		Actually I have a feeling this is simply a message from the early stopping callback that it would stop if it weren't for the fact that min_epochs has been set to 100
