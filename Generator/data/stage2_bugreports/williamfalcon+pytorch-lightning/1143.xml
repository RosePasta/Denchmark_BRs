	<summary>`use_amp` is broken in 0.7.0</summary>
	<description>
I see that use_amp is deprecated but since the Trainer still accepts it as an argument, I believe this is still a bug.
The issue is that the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/3c2fd560aa4d31b4f48ee225b83361deec53d9c7/pytorch_lightning/core/hooks.py#L136-L143&gt;hook that deals with this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 specifically checks if . However, the Trainer does not set  if .
Proposed solution:
if use_amp is passed in, set precision = 16 and raise a deprecation warning.
