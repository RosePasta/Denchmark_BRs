	<summary>New logger abstraction breaks self.experiment</summary>
	<description>
with the new abstraction we can't do:
self.experiment.log_histogram(...)
instead we have to do:
self.experiment.experiment.log_histogram(...)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/neggert&gt;@neggert&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 any suggestions on how to fix? Ideally the user can just access the self.experiment object directly and operate on it.

		I might be missing something, but can't you do self.logger.experiment.log_histogram(...). AFAIK, self.experiment doesn't exist anymore.
We could certainly add a log_histogram method to the base logger and just not implement it for loggers that don't support it.

 yeah, i think every logger needs to allow access to self.experiment...
Tensorboard summarywriter has tens of methods like these that we can't be overriding. So the pattern is either:
self.logger.experiment.do_something()
or we modify the abstraction so that you are directly operating on the logger when you call:
self.logger.do_something()
