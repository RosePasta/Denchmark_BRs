		Sometimes I just want to load a trained model to predict  unlabeled  data.
Is there no corresponding test_step method?

. there is no test step yet but it’s alloted for this week. if you need it before you can load the model using the instructions in the docs and do your own test loop right now. otherwise, just check back in later in the week when it’s live.
