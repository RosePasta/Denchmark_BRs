&lt;denchmark-code&gt; ERROR collecting pl_examples/full_examples/semantic_segmentation/semseg.py

 No module named 'torchvision.models.segmentation'
oops, looks like this test fails. Need to fix asap

According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html&gt;this page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it does exist. Not sure why it fails.

According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/blog/torchvision03/&gt;this page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, segmentation models were introduced in version 0.3 of torchvision. So, I think the tests might be using older versions (for backwards compatibility maybe?)
What I can do is add a custom implementation of U-Net (popular architecture) and replace the torchvision model. But even that'll take a few hours because I have some work right now.

 yes please. That would be ideal. This is breaking the core tests, so we'll have to roll this back otherwise.
Thanks!

@williamFalcon major question is what torchvision version do you want to support, in past we had there torchvision&gt;=0.4

I would also suggest keeping torchvision&gt;=0.3 at least because a lot of object detection and segmentation models were introduced in 0.3. These are very good architectures which will be good for examples, instead of using custom models.

		Note that this package is not dependent on torchvision any more, just some tests and examples...
