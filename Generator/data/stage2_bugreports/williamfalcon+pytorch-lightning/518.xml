	<summary>versions after .5.2.1 do not print weights summary</summary>
	<description>
ubuntu 18.04.3lts, no virtual environment
Model summary is not printed in versions .5.3, .5.3.1, and .5.3.2. trainer.weights_summary is set to 'full', but nothing is printed on screen.

		This is because they recently changed from printing to logging (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/282&gt;#282&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/457&gt;#457&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and the summary is logged as info, but the log level is set to warning and above.
With

you can see the summary, but the formatting is messed up because of the "INFO" text in front.

		The summary logging happens &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/blob/9785a3e78e6c5b5ff2bde45d36f5e1165dbe16ab/pytorch_lightning/core/lightning.py#L320&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 How do we have to configure the logging so it always shows the summary?

		We have moved from print to standard Python logging

		Yes, when it didn't print a quick look at the code showed the shift to logging. And it is easy to just print the summary myself - so no need to change - I just thought it best to bring it to your attention in case this was not intended.

		I believe that the logging should be visible in terminal...

		Ahh I didn't notice this case before, thx for bringing this up &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sneiman&gt;@sneiman&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

A possible fix would be to simply use print here? since summarize() seems to be called outside the tqdm loop.

 what do you think?
We can also consider removing the level msgs like this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46584670/remove-the-log-level-printing-in-python-logging&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46584670/remove-the-log-level-printing-in-python-logging&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We can also check of the LOG_LEVEL is INFO then print just for this case. So we still respect the LOGGING LEVEL but have correct formatting

Hi, the logging level is set &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/blob/a6d64ac013868160fafdda6a0794dc6709301967/pytorch_lightning/trainer/trainer.py#L244&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, should it behave the same with  ?

 I agree with you, I'll open a PR soon.
