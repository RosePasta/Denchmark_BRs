	<summary>Inconsistency # calls between on_batch_start, on_batch_end in train and (val, test)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Please reproduce using the BoringModel and post here&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Currently, on_batch_start is called along on_train_batch_start during training but doesn't for test and validation.
It results in a different number of function calls between training and testing / validation
Proposition to uniform the internal behaviour:
Move on_batch_start  into on_evaluation_batch_start and respectively for on_batch_end, to be consistent with training procedure.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please copy and paste the output from our
&lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/master/tests/collect_env_details.py&gt;environment collection script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(or fill out the checklist below manually).
You can get the script and run it with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/master/tests/collect_env_details.py
# For security purposes, please check the contents of collect_env_details.py before running it.
python collect_env_details.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
