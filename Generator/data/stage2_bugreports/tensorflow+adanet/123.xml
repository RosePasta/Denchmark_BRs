	<summary>Failing tutorial adanet_tpu.ipynb during evaluation</summary>
	<description>
Unfortunately an example adanet_tpu.ipynb has failed on me.
it fails with a bunch of stack traces, please find more details in attached document. One from the top is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AbortedError: Session 5a5ab9da26cfbcc9 is not found.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lc0&gt;@lc0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the Aborted Error seems spurious. If you look at the log a few lines up see some other errors about evaluation steps "steps" not being set on TPU.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6221162/65047193-04945b80-d930-11e9-8dad-5e046b5359b6.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

On TPU you must explicitly set the number of eval steps to run and unfortunately cannot rely on StopIteration exceptions to stop evaluating.

 yeah, I also was thinking about this part. It's part of tutorial, I wonder how did it work before without explicit steps.
In any case we should update the tutorial to get it back to working state.

		Oh I see what you're saying now. Yea the notebook was written before we supported evaluating on TPU and would always eval on CPU (in which case you don't need to specify the steps). I'll update the notebook. Good catch!

 since the fix is in code itself, what is the cycle of release? it would be fixed in the next version right? shall we bump a version?

@lc0 v0.8.0 was just released. Please upgrade with pip install adanet -U, and let us know if it fixes your issue.

yeah, updated tutorial version eval_on_tpu=False, works perfectly
