Hello Avinash!
I just randomly stumbled onto this repository. It was weird to find out that you have copied most of the working code from my repository &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TheFairBear/Super-SlowMo&gt;https://github.com/TheFairBear/Super-SlowMo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can I please get credits? Thank you!

		Yes, I did use your code as base mostly in the train.py. But I also added things from scratch trying to get the network to converge and make the repository more accessible. I have added your repository in the references. Thanks for your work!
