Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avinashpaliwal&gt;@avinashpaliwal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , Thanks for sharing this awesome work! However, I cannot reproduce the performance that you released:

pretrained mine	29.77	0.874	15.58

What I got is

PSNR: 24.54, SSIM: 0.762, IE: 24.64

The result obtained by get_results_bug_fixed.sh script.
It's much worse than yours. And I have no idea what is going wrong.

The complete script can be found &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/chuchienshu/aa7e9a98fb4db54c124f7813a28d7fa5&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. So it's easily to reproduce this Bug. In fact, I just adapted part of your code to perform single frame interpolation.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS:  Ubuntu
Device Used: GPU
Setup Info:  PyTorch 0.4.1, Python 3.5.2

Any suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

, did you find the solution? I have the same problem.
I took your script for single frame interpolation and after I ran get_results_bug_fixed.sh script I got similar results with yours.
