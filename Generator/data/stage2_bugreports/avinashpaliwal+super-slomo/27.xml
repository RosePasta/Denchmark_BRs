Describe the bug
It doesn't converse faster when I set the parameter(batch_size) to a number greater than one.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
e.g.

Run cells in video_to_slomo.py
Set batch_size to a number greater than one.
Error/Abnormal behavior: It uses more memory of cuda but doesn't converse faster.

Expected behavior
It can really converse faster.
Interpolated results/error output
Add frames or terminal output as applicable.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS:  Windows
Device Used GPU
Setup Info [e.g. PyTorch 0.4.1, Python 3.6, ]

Additional context
The utilization rate of the gpu &lt;10%.(with Quadro P6000)

		I have not tested that feature yet. Also, though I am not sure but when you use GPU, saving the image might become a bottleneck as I have to save every image one by one.
