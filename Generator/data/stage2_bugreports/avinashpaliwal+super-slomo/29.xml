	<summary>Many visual artefacts</summary>
	<description>
Hello, I've tried this interesting script on my mac. It seems to generate a slowmo without any issues (slowly, but no errors), however the end result is full of artefacts like so:

I've tried with several videos and always got these blinking colors. Any ideas what I should try next? Thanks!

		Other users have also reported similar artifacts and I tried a temporary fix for CPU. I think for now you have to use the pretrained model as specified in the README or try training it from scratch on your device.
