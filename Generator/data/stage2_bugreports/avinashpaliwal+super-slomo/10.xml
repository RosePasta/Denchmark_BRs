		Hello,
Thank you for sharing you idea for us. I followed your code but I have a problem when I ran it on Linux OS.
It make an error message 'AttributeError: module 'ctypes' has no attribute 'windll'' when I ran python video_to_slomo.py.
Please let me know what's the matter with it?
Regars,

@Zzzzy411 How can fix 'int' object is not iterable issue? Can you tell me it please?

I found the bug !
The follwoing line in the 'dataloader.py'
image = _pil_loader(self.framesPath[index][frameIndex], cropArea, randomFrameFlip)
should be changed to
image = _pil_loader(self.framesPath[index][frameIndex], cropArea, None, randomFrameFlip)

Regars,

To solve the error 'AttributeError: module 'ctypes' has no attribute 'windll'' in Linux, you just need to comment out the line in the 'video_to_slomo.py':
ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetFileAttributesW(extractionDir, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN)
This works for me.
