	<summary>run_python_tests.sh only install one python package of Paddle</summary>
	<description>
The error log is &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.org/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/jobs/235680370#L1829&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Paddle currently has two python packages, paddle and py_paddle. It seems run_python_tests.sh only installs the py_paddle package, but used for all python scripts tests. This is a bug and will crash some Paddle unit tests.
run_python_tests.sh is used by test SWIG API originally, and should install py_paddle package only before. But since we used it to bootstrap all python scripts tests, we should install paddle, too.
