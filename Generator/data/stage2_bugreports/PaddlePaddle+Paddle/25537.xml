		看起来报错是在elementwise op上 elementwise op的两个输入维度不对 如报错，两个shape应该完全相等或者可以broadcast。 可以使用fluid.layers.Print() api 打印下某个输出看是否符合预期

 Could this issue be fixed in 1.8.5(next month)?

		It is related to fact that some tensors are having data_layout set to NHWC , while model is NCHW. Status: investigating.

 I'm sorry for late response as I was away from office. I have just resumed investigation on this problem and will do our best to have it fixed.

 I would like to share some findings and ask for advice. Reason why there is a crash is that this model is having pool2d ops and those ops are having an attribute :  , which is used to indicate if model is working on NCHW or NHWC data. In the past it was agreed that either all  attribs are set to NCHW or all are set to NHWC , there shouldn't be scenario where some operators are working with data in NCHW and some others in data arranged in NHWC.  Problem is that in this model there are pool2d ops and their's  values are diffrent. for example pool2d(id=139) is having NHWC:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15085062/89898077-5dbc4c00-dbe0-11ea-8532-57b3398792a4.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

While pool2d(id=134) is having  set to kNCHW:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15085062/89898379-e4712900-dbe0-11ea-8291-f20a95ac11d7.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

PaddlePaddle oneDNN integration does not support situation where some operators are to work on NCHW and some others on NHWC. Is this intentional that two diffrent pool2d ops are using diffrent data_format ?

Is this intentional that two different pool2d ops are using different data_format

Discussed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/phlrain&gt;@phlrain&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it is not reasonable that two different pool2d ops are using different data_format. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/phlrain&gt;@phlrain&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wanghuancoder&gt;@wanghuancoder&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will help see the training logical at first.
Thanks for the analysis of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jczaja&gt;@jczaja&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lidanqing-intel&gt;@lidanqing-intel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 We make two different pool2d ops use the same data_format, and train a new model for inference.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6836917/93084543-cb1f3900-f6c6-11ea-8564-91a9c76bed2a.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But we can infer successfully with MKL, but fails with MKLDNN. The error is
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6836917/93085794-b348b480-f6c8-11ea-9478-8859b33c9774.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I will email the new inference model to you.

 I have question regarding this situation. Model is to be executed using NHWC input data as pool2d ops are having  set . The other ops in a model do not have  attribute so the way they work should be transparent to whether we use NCHW or NHWC signal. The thing is that this model is having  op . Matmul does not have  so  it should work properly regardless NCHW or NHWC used. Could you please confirm that   should NOT have  and that its implementation will work properly regardless NCWH or NHWC arrangment used?

Yes, it is. matmul should not have data_format attribute, and its implementation will work properly regardless any data_format used.
