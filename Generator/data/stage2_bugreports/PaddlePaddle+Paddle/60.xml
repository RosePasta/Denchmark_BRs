	<summary>Cudnn Batch-normalization not working with cudnn-v4</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I tried make-test with cudnn v4. The batch-normalization reports "segmentation fault" problem when I make test.
The Cudnn-v5 version works without problems. (Maybe cudnn-v5 suggested?)

		Thanks for your feedback. We suggest to use cudnn-v5 or cudnn-v5.1. And I will fix it. Thanks!
