		Seems you need to delete the files under paddle/dist to delete built packages of earlier builds.

 Thanks for the trick!
But should we make our building system outputs the whl file to /paddle/build instead of /paddle/paddle/dist ? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gangliao&gt;@gangliao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  Sounds reasonable to relocate installation packages into the build directory.
We only need to modify single line in paddle/api/CMakeLists.txt
install(DIRECTORY ${PROJ_ROOT}/paddle/dist/ DESTINATION opt/paddle/share/wheels)
to
install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/dist/ DESTINATION opt/paddle/share/wheels)
Not a big deal!

		It seems that we cannot change the output directory of wheel files to paddle/build.
So &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/issues/1995#issuecomment-299340531&gt;#1995 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is the solution.

		It seems that a quick fix is to delete the dist directory everytime we build the wheel file.
