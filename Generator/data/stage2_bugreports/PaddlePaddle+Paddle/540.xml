	<summary>Signed/unsigned integer comparison</summary>
	<description>
Thanks for your work on this library.
I'm trying to compile Paddle on a platform you don't support yet, Ubuntu 16.04. I think this has a different compiler from Ubuntu 14.04. I'm seeing compiler errors from sign/unsigned comparison. I think newer GCC fixed a bug that ignored these errors in template expansions.
There are at least two errors in the file &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/paddle/math/BaseMatrix.cu&gt;https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/paddle/math/BaseMatrix.cu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , in the  and  functions. The  and  variables are declared as , and then compared against unsigned types.
There is a similar problem in math/Vector.cpp, I think in the toOneHotSparseMatrix method.
I think policy of signed and unsigned type usage in the math module might need review. I see that the dimension members are mostly defined as size_t. However, various local variables are of type int, and some of the methods take int arguments.
You might also check other code that calls the CHECK_EQ, CHECK_NE, CHECK_LT, CHECK_GT macros in the Logging module. I think the signed/unsigned comparison error currently seems like a very easy error to make.

		That's right. There are lots of similar problems in code now, it should be checked and fixed soon.
