	<summary>Protobuf library should upgrade to protobuf 3.3</summary>
	<description>
The current release of protobuf is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/v3.3.2&gt;3.3.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but Paddle is using protobuf 3.1.0. In protobuf 3.1.0, there are several bugs which affect our code:

In Protobuf 3.1.0, map in protobuf cannot be compiled by GCC with -Wextra.

The protobuf issue is protocolbuffers/protobuf#2425.
In our attribute design, map is used to associate from attribute name to value.


Protobuf 3.1.0 uses a deprecated API on MacOS.

The protobuf issue is protocolbuffers/protobuf#2182
Our issue is #1936.

 Should we upgrade our protobuf library? If we should, I could give a PR tomorrow.

  I don't have the environment to build the protobuf 3.3.2 on ARM,  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Xreki&gt;@Xreki&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  Can you please build this version? Is it feasible to upgrade protobuf?

		I have tried to build the newest protobuf before and met some problem. In the building process of the newest version, there is a need to generate a binary file and run the binary file.
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/cmake/libprotoc.cmake#L212&gt;cmake/libprotoc.cmake&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;add_executable(js_embed ${protobuf_source_dir}/src/google/protobuf/compiler/js/embed.cc)
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT ${protobuf_source_dir}/src/google/protobuf/compiler/js/well_known_types_embed.cc
  DEPENDS js_embed ${js_well_known_types_sources}
  COMMAND js_embed ${js_well_known_types_sources} &gt; ${protobuf_source_dir}/src/google/protobuf/compiler/js/well_known_types_embed.cc
)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Simple command make was used, thus all the targets of Protobuf will be made. I will try another detailed command like make libprotobuf to not build protoc.

		This issue is blocked by Protobuf's cmake. We cannot upgrade our protobuf from 3.1 to 3.3 because, in 3.2, cmake cannot build a cross-compile protobuf.
The PRs are added and not merged.

protocolbuffers/protobuf#2998
protocolbuffers/protobuf#2980

		The &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/pull/3878&gt;protocolbuffers/protobuf#3878&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixed cross-compiling for android.
