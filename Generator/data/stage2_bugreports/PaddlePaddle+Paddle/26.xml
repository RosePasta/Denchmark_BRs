	<summary>bug in hl_devce_functions.cuh</summary>
	<description>
Just made a git pull, but compiling paddle failed. There's an extra #endif in the end of the file hl_device_functions.cuh. Commenting the extra #endif  out, paddle was built with cuda ok. Now going to try what's the difference using cuda in image_classification demo.
