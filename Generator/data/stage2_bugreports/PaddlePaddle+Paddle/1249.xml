	<summary>MNIST CNN training doesn't work on Cuda 8.0 + Cudnn 5.1</summary>
	<description>
My paddle demo training on mnist is good on cpu but doesn't converge on GPU. I used latest release of Ubuntu 16.04, cuda and cudnn. The codes are in the ./demo, with standard setup. The same codes run perfectly on the old version cuda 7.5 + cudnn 5.
After many iterations, the test error is still high. The error rate is still 30%+, which should be around 1% in previous releases.

Which Paddle version you installed? Did you build the source code from the develop branch?
Here are some hints may help you figure out the problem:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/issues/1207&gt;#1207&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		It seems that new versions of cuda and cudnn cause the probelm. I will verify this demo using cuda 8.0 + cudnn 5.1.

		Hello, I'm using the latest version: paddle 0.9.0. I built it from source.
Yeah, should be, I strongly agree. The same code runs great on my cpu and others with cuda 7.5+ cudnn 5: performance strong and 2 pass error only 2%; the same code on my gpu cuda 8.0 + cudnn 5, many passes still 50% error. I'm pretty sure that something is wrong...
Thanks :)
