		It works well when I remove the build argument: UBUNTU_MIRROR=mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt, so I also remove it on CI to make the node work well.

		interesting, looks mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt should give more flexibility than just  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ in apt's source list. I guess mirrors.ubuntu.com was temp down yesterday? let me test it out to see if we can add UBUNTU_MIRROR back.

		Looks UBUNTU_MIRROR is working fine now. I added one configuration parameter in project PR_CI named WITH_UBUNTU_MIRROR to toggle UBUNTU_MIRROR ON and OFF. Currently I set this value to ON, if you see any further issue, try set it OFF in the temp build run dialog to see if that helps as a personal build.
also, I found UBUNTU_MIRROR reduces the total build time a lot, I think we should keep it if possible.
