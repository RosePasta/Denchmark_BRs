		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gangliao&gt;@gangliao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Have you started working on this issue? If not, I was just wondering if I could contribute to this one since I recently worked on the convolution codes and one of my co-worker needs this feature soon.
thanks

  Actually, I did not start this work immediately, because some other docs and bugs need me to fix soon. So if you want to contribute to this one, I am very appreciated it.
Thanks.
