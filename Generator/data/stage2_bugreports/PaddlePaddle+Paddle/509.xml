	<summary>seqToseq demo Pretrained model can't be downloaded</summary>
	<description>
I want to download the pretrained model by the script "wmt14_model.sh" in the seqToseq demo.  The command is "wget &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.googledrive.com/host/0B7Q8d52jqeI9ejh6Q1RpMTFQT1k/wmt14_model.tar.gz&gt;https://www.googledrive.com/host/0B7Q8d52jqeI9ejh6Q1RpMTFQT1k/wmt14_model.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 --no-check-certificate". I tried many kinds of VPNs but failed to download. So I wonder if you can provide a download site which can be reached in China without VPN.

		You can have a look in wmt14_model.sh, it says:
# you can also directly download from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8q577s

 It should be added to Paddle CDN. I will handle it.
