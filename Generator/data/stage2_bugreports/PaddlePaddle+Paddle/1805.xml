	<summary>Bug for translayer ?</summary>
	<description>
Under paddle/gserver/layers/TransLayer.cpp
For back propagation the gradient is directly assigned:
 MatrixPtr preGrad = getInputGrad(0);
 outputGrad-&gt;transpose(preGrad, false);
Will there be a problem when you have this layer connect to multiple branches?  During the backward process, the gradient will be overwritten by the last branch, while missing the gradient from others.
Thanks.

		Yes, this is a bug.  It should add the transposed outputGrad  to preGrad.
