	<summary>Need to report uninitialized error when paddle.init() is not called</summary>
	<description>
Currently if paddle.init() is not called in the beginning, there can be some strange errors not understandable by the user (e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/issues/1971&gt;#1971&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ). We should explicitly check whether paddle.init() is called and report a sensible error message.

		Yes. I also encountered the same problem and it wasted me a lot of time.

		I think we can add a global flag that is paddle initialized. And increase the judgment that has been initialized before some operation.
