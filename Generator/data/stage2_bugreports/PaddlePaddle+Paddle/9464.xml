	<summary>Executor should wait for operators before deleting the local scope</summary>
	<description>
In every Executor:Run(), all the temporary variables are created in a local scope. This local scope (including variables belong to it) is deleted at the end of the Executor:Run().
Since operators maybe launched asynchronously, the host code has to explicitly add a wait. Otherwise, delete local scope may happen before the execution of an operator.
Sidenote: fetch_op, usually the last op to be executed, has a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/paddle/fluid/operators/fetch_op.cc#L63&gt;wait&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. So ProgramDesc with fetch op won't have this issue. But it is not guaranteed that every ProgramDesc has a fetch op at the end.
