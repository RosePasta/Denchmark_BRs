	<summary>`save_inference_model` prune has bug when the fetch_list has variable that is both input and output of some op</summary>
	<description>
When the variable that is both input and output of some operator(such as sigmoid), if it is contained in the fetch_list, the prune API in save_inference_model will fail to include that operator.
A real example:
y = fc(x, act='sigmoid')
# that will add a sigmoid after the fc, and because the sigmoid's input and output share the same variable
# when `prune`d, the framework will drop the sigmoid
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Temporary fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Add a scale op to force include the sigmoid like operator:
y = fc(x, act='sigmoid')
y0 = scale(y, 1)
that works!
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Long-term fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Delete the buggy prune method, save the original model, and in CPP inference, load that model in IR and prune it with an SSA graph.
