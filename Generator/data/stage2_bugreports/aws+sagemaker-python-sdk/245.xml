&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Framework (e.g. TensorFlow) / Algorithm (e.g. KMeans): Tensorflow custom algorithm
Framework Version: 1.4.1
Python Version: 2.7
CPU or GPU: CPU
Python SDK Version: 1.5.0
Are you using a custom image: No

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I get OSError: [Errno 21] Is a directory when training locally on my machine(MacBook Pro).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow

#Bucket location to save your custom code in tar.gz format.
custom_code_upload_location = 's3://sagemaker-&lt;rest of bucket name&gt;/customcode/tensorflow'

#Bucket location where results of model training are saved.
model_artifacts_location = 's3://sagemaker-&lt;rest of bucket name&gt;/artifacts'

role = "arn:aws:iam::****" # commented out

iris_estimator = TensorFlow(entry_point='sagemaker-test.py',
                            role=role,
                            output_path=model_artifacts_location,
                            code_location=custom_code_upload_location,
                            train_instance_count=1,
                            hyperparameters={'dropout_keep_prob': 0.5},
                            train_instance_type='local',
                            training_steps=1000,
                            evaluation_steps=10)

print (iris_estimator)

train_data_location = 's3://sagemaker-&lt;rest of bucket name&gt;'

iris_estimator.fit(train_data_location)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the custom algorithm  is created by following &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/tf-example1.html&gt;this tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

the above code is working in sagemaker notebook instance with train_instance_type='ml.c4.xlarge', I am facing this issue only when running locally.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Minimal repro / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Shivakishore14&gt;@Shivakishore14&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for using SageMaker!  should point to a tarball, not a directory. Can you try compressing everything in  into a tarball, uploading it to S3, and passing the path to that for  instead?

 I tried that and didn't work, I found the issue and the problem is in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/local/image.py#L275&gt;https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/local/image.py#L275&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
This error occurs when a folder typed object is tried to download.
PR for this fix is on route :)

 I think this issue should be labelled  not , because this error appears each time when you have folders inside  in local mode.

		sure, I'll change the label. sorry for not doing it sooner - was a little more intent on getting your PR merged

 nope, we just needed to wait for integ tests to pass. I've now merged your PR. Thanks for the contribution! :)

		my bad, re-opening until it's released to PyPI

		Fix has now been released in v1.5.1. Thanks again for your contribution!
