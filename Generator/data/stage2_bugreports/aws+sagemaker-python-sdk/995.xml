	<summary>Framework version is treated as None even though it was passed</summary>
	<description>
Please fill out the form below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Framework (e.g. TensorFlow) / Algorithm (e.g. KMeans): Tensorflow
Framework Version: 1.13.1
Python Version: py3
CPU or GPU: CPU
Python SDK Version: ?
Are you using a custom image: Yes

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Framework_version was passed to the estimator but logs still say it was not passed.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mnist_estimator = TensorFlow(role=sagemaker.get_execution_role(),
                  base_job_name='demo-mnist',
                  train_instance_count=1,
                  train_instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',
                  image_name=docker_image_name,
                  entry_point=mnist_script,
                  framework_version='1.13.1',
                  py_version='py3',
                  script_mode=True,
                  hyperparameters=mnist_hyperparameters,
                  train_max_run=1800,
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;W0823 06:36:11.344061 140533465798464 estimator.py:280] No framework_version specified, defaulting to version 1.11. This is not the latest supported version. If you would like to use version 1.14, please add framework_version=1.14 to your constructor.
W0823 06:36:11.344887 140533465798464 estimator.py:290] tensorflow py2 container will be deprecated soon.

Hopefully above is enough, if not ping me on Chime.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rahul003&gt;@rahul003&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Interesting that this is happening.
The error message is started by this line: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/tensorflow/estimator.py#L282&gt;https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/tensorflow/estimator.py#L282&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which happens during the TensorFlow object initialization.
Can you please paste your SageMaker runner code? I am intrigued on how framework_version is being bypassed even though clearly in your description above you are passing it in. The warning is stated immediately during initialization, so there is nothing that can cause it to all of a sudden become none.
Where and how are you running this?
Thanks!
