	<summary>UnicodeDecodeError with README.rst</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Python Version: 3.6.4
CPU or GPU: Macbook Air 2017

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is a problem with the README.rst. Python gave me an UnicodeDecodeError. I tried to install with pip and directly from this repo. Both throw the error I posted below.
Solution for me: I cleared the README.rst so that there are no ASCI oder UTF-8 symbols in it. Works fine on my local Macbook.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Minimal repo / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ pip install SageMaker

		Thanks for reporting this! Since you mentioned that you already went through the README and removed the offending characters, would you be interested in submitting a pull request with the fix?

		Unfortunately I removed the whole README because I didn't found the wrong character. Thats why I can't submitting a pull request. I'm sorry. Maybe I can try it later again. If I found it I'll send you a pull request.

		oh, I see. I've tried to reproduce the error, but it's been working fine for me with Python versions 3.5, 3.6.4, and 3.6.5.
The character at position 5556 looks to be the period in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blame/master/README.rst#L151&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. In my editor, the first space after that period was displayed as a red underline instead of just a space. If you have a chance, would you mind trying deleting that and re-building?

		The PR is merged. And we haven't got any bug reports till now.
So I will close this. Feel free to reopen if anybody gets the bug again.
