	<summary>Documentation of requirements_file not on readthedocs.io</summary>
	<description>
Was looking for details on how to use the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/6b809eba605119ff274b39b3c8df3dd1163e784a/src/sagemaker/tensorflow/estimator.py#L123&gt;requirements_file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 parameter, but that does not appear to be listed on &lt;denchmark-link:http://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sagemaker.tensorflow.html&gt;http://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sagemaker.tensorflow.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The builds on RTD are failing, so nothing new has been published recently. &lt;denchmark-link:https://readthedocs.org/projects/sagemaker/builds/&gt;https://readthedocs.org/projects/sagemaker/builds/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/stephenash&gt;@stephenash&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Thanks for using Amazon SageMaker!
Right, our docs build has failing since adding the scipy package. We know about this and will be fixing this, but I don't have an ETA for this. But there's documentation for requirements_file in the Tensorflow Estimator:



sagemaker-python-sdk/src/sagemaker/tensorflow/estimator.py


        Lines 111 to 125
      in
      6b809eb






 def __init__(self, training_steps=None, evaluation_steps=None, checkpoint_path=None, py_version='py2', 



 framework_version=TF_VERSION, requirements_file='', **kwargs): 



 """Initialize an ``TensorFlow`` estimator. 



         Args: 



             training_steps (int): Perform this many steps of training. `None`, the default means train forever. 



             evaluation_steps (int): Perform this many steps of evaluation. `None`, the default means that evaluation 



                 runs until input from eval_input_fn is exhausted (or another exception is raised). 



             checkpoint_path (str): Identifies S3 location where checkpoint data during model training can be 



                 saved (default: None). For distributed model training, this parameter is required. 



             py_version (str): Python version you want to use for executing your model training code (default: 'py2'). 



             framework_version (str): TensorFlow version you want to use for executing your model training code. 



                 List of supported versions https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#tensorflow-sagemaker-estimators 



             requirements_file (str): Path to a ``requirements.txt`` file (default: ''). The path should be within and 



                 relative to ``source_dir``. Details on the format can be found in the 



                 `Pip User Guide &lt;https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format&gt;`_. 





And in the README:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/6b809eba605119ff274b39b3c8df3dd1163e784a/README.rst#optional-arguments-2&gt;https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/6b809eba605119ff274b39b3c8df3dd1163e784a/README.rst#optional-arguments-2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Does that clarify how to use requirements_file? If not, we can improve the docs.
Thanks again!

 I found those eventually, and have successfully used it. I just stopped reading the README after , so didn't find what I was looking for at first.
Thanks!
