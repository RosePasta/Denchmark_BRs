&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When checking for logs of a submitted job session.logs_for_job() function only marks a job as completed if the job status is Completed or Failed. If the job was stopped (for example because of timeout), then the job status is Stopped and the function goes into an infinite loop.
if status == 'Completed' or status == 'Failed':
    state = LogState.JOB_COMPLETE
