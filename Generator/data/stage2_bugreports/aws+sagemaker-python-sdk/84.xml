no h5py library in the Tensorflow container, such that tf.keras.model.load_weights does not work!!!

		Sorry for that!
Temporary work around would be:
from subprocess import call
call("pip install h5py".split(" "))
We have a pull request open for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/issues/52&gt;installing dependencies issue&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We are also considering adding h5py library to the Tensorflow container.

 , yes, i did this thing and I also ran the h5py.run_tests() successfully, however, when we load the weights from h5 file:
model = tf.keras.models.model_from_json(d)
model.load_weights(model_weight_path)
it still reported the error:
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/models.py", line 685, in load_weights
raise ImportError('load_weights requires h5py.')
ImportError: load_weights requires h5py.

		I saw the new release of sagemaker 1.1.1 supporting the requirments.txt packages. However, even we install the package, it still reports the error:

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chinazm&gt;@chinazm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I'm looking into this issue now. Installing h5py via subprocess.call seems to be failing because of validation in this module, where if h5py can't be imported when the module is initially imported, an ImportError is raised:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5aee07fd0462d00c52efb5d3c86bfb955a9d976e/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/models.py#L44-L47&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5aee07fd0462d00c52efb5d3c86bfb955a9d976e/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/models.py#L44-L47&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5aee07fd0462d00c52efb5d3c86bfb955a9d976e/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/models.py#L697-L698&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5aee07fd0462d00c52efb5d3c86bfb955a9d976e/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/models.py#L697-L698&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In other words, if we import tensorflow, then install h5py at runtime, load_weights doesn't know that we can actually import h5py, so it throws this error.
And unfortunately, reloading the tensorflow module is inadvisable: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/15741&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#15741&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

About using the requirements file: similarly: it seems that h5py is installed, but again, it's possible that we're importing TensorFlow before the h5py module is installed, so the validation fails later on, though I haven't confirmed this. I'll create an item for us to handle this case correctly.
We should add h5py to our TensorFlow container so that installing it through pip isn't necessary. I am adding a work item for this too.
In the meantime, as an immediate work-around, I made this gist, which doesn't do the import validation, and instead installs / imports h5py when load_weights is called. I believe you can just drop this function instead of tf.keras.model.load_weights:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/andremoeller/c09c8a3bc3eaf0b873a2a3238b0a1657&gt;https://gist.github.com/andremoeller/c09c8a3bc3eaf0b873a2a3238b0a1657&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks, and please let me know how things go, or if something's unclear.

		Thank you Andre &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andremoeller&gt;@andremoeller&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
your answer is very helpful. However, sometime we need to use the model weight from the imagenet, like
tf.keras.applications.inception_v3.InceptionV3(weights='imagenet')
tf.keras.applications.resnet50.ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
then that will raise the ImportError('load_weights requires h5py.')
Thank you!
Best,

		In addition, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andremoeller&gt;@andremoeller&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I think I was using the requirements.txt in the sagemaker 1.1.1 (new feature), not  Installing h5py via subprocess.call. I think this will install the dependencies first prior to launch the tensorflow...

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chinazm&gt;@chinazm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Got it. We'll be incorporating h5py into our image so this isn't necessary. And we're also looking into why installing it with the requirements_file didn't work in this case. Thanks!

		<comment id='8' author='chinazm' date='2018-03-23T05:56:44Z'>
		Hello,
We have added h5py within the Tensorflow container and promoted those images.
Thank you for using SageMaker!
