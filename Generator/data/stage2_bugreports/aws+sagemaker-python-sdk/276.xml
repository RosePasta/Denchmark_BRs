	<summary>[BUG] Error thrown when trying to enable instance metrics for MXNet</summary>
	<description>
Please fill out the form below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System Information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Framework (e.g. TensorFlow) / Algorithm (e.g. KMeans): MXNet
Framework Version: 1.1
Python Version: 3
CPU or GPU: CPU
Python SDK Version: 1.5.1
Are you using a custom image: No

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The MXNet container by default does not emit instance metrics. When trying to enable it setting enable_cloudwatch_metrics=True, the training job fails with the exception pasted below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Minimal repro / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Command to train (note it uses some of my own python code as it's a custom MXNet model)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    m = MXNet("kamel_estimator.py",
              source_dir='src',
              role=role,
              train_instance_count=1,
              train_instance_type="ml.m4.xlarge",
              sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,
              py_version="py3",
              base_job_name="kamel-test-20180705",
              enable_cloudwatch_metrics=True,
              output_path=get_config(current_env, 'artifacts_s3_bucket'),
              code_location=get_config(current_env, 'artifacts_s3_bucket'),
              hyperparameters={'some_param': 1)
m.fit('s3://kamel-data/training/data)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Training job CloudWatch log showing the error&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Notes&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


I am suspecting the issue is not actually with the Python SDK, but with the container itself not having the necessary library
I am opening the issue here as this is the entry point that exposes the problem
All over the SDK, enable_cloudwatch_metrics is always set to False. This might be due to the knowledge that the containers not supporting it. Otherwise, testing for cases with enable_cloudwatch_metrics=True sound like something that should be added.

  thanks for the report! We will look into this.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/iquintero&gt;@iquintero&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I'm seeing some progress as evidenced by your &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/292&gt;#292&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I saw in your change that in the estimator there's now a warning that this is deprecated and that metrics are by default emitted for training jobs. How about for endpoints?
I already have an already running endpoint and I can see it's not emitting anything. That was the main purpose I tried to enable the metrics - to monitor the endpoint.
Also, related to that, I failed to find any documentation about SAGEMAKER_CONTAINER_LOG_LEVEL and what values are relevant or whether this affects Instance Metrics at all.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/humanzz&gt;@humanzz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I just checked in one of my endpoints and it does post metrics. On the AWS Console under View Instance Metrics it does seem like there are no metrics:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1126247/43477223-811b2aa6-94af-11e8-91f3-db0c8bbc00b9.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However if you click under /aws/sagemaker/Endpoints and keep the same endpoint name filter, you will see something similar to:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1126247/43477310-b543fc9a-94af-11e8-84f1-2c4906f81c08.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We can see there are 5 metrics for this endpoint, clicking on it will show all the actual instance metrics:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1126247/43477367-d6af06b8-94af-11e8-8532-e72dfd892527.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I will check with our console team to see why the link from the SageMaker console is not correct. However this should hopefully unblock you.
Regarding SAGEMAKER_CONTAINER_LOG_LEVEL, the valid values are whatever the python logger accepts:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging-levels&gt;https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging-levels&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Hope this helps!

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/iquintero&gt;@iquintero&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I confirm I found the metrics for my endpoints as per your instructions and this definitely unblocks me.
I hope the console team fixes this soon as this is tbh quite confusing.
Thanks!

		seems like the change has been released for awhile now (and I can see the instance metrics when I look at the AWS console by simply clicking "View instance metrics"), so closing this issue.
