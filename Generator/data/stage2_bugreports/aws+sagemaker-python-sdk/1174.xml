	<summary>Bug in v1.47.0 after allowing default bucket to be specified by the user</summary>

 thank you for the quick fix!
I am afraid this feature (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/1168&gt;#1168&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) introduced a bug :/ And now by default the SDK tries to create the bucket all the time

I upgraded to SageMaker 1.47
Run below lines of code

import sagemaker
role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()

I get the below error
ClientError: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the CreateBucket operation: Access Denied

Thanks for reporting this! We're looking into this now.

		While we push a revert out, I believe a workaround is to specify the session with the custom bucket name as part of the session you pass in to .get_execution_role().
i.e.:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;my_session = Session(..., default_bucket="my_custom_bucket")
role = sagemaker.get_execution_role(sagemaker_session=my_session)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Alternatively, you can also downgrade to a previous version to unblock yourself.
In the meantime, we're working on a version of this fix that doesn't create the bucket on init.
