	<summary>The TensorFlow container saves the exported models in Ascending order</summary>
	<description>
We found that there is a bug in sagemaker to export the model:
sagemaker first exported checkpoints as exported models in the output folder and after training there will be a final model zipped and exported. We found sagemaker exported and zipped the models on ascending order not the most recent model exported.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chinazm&gt;@chinazm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I tried this out and confirmed that we seem to be exporting the wrong checkpoint. I sent this PR to fix this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-training-toolkit/pull/58&gt;aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-training-toolkit#58&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks!
