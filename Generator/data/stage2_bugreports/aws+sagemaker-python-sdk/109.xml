	<summary>TensorFlow logs not showing up on CloudWatch or console</summary>
	<description>
A recent changed on sagemaker caused tensorflow logs not showing up on the console and cloudwatch. This makes a lot of tasks very difficult including hyper parameter tunning. I've tested on my own code and the abalone example: no tf logs shown.
