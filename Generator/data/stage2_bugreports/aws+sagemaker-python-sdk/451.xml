	<summary>input data config ignored in local mode?</summary>
	<description>
The local image clearly ignores context_type of an input,



sagemaker-python-sdk/src/sagemaker/local/image.py


         Line 246
      in
      385d40a






 json_input_data_config = { 





despite they somehow passed unit test



sagemaker-python-sdk/tests/unit/test_local_session.py


         Line 328
      in
      c8006fa






 def test_file_input_content_type(): 





My same custom model runs in remote but not in local. This inspires my question: how are context types detected? E.g., by file suffix?
Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yifeim&gt;@yifeim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  this is fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/449&gt;#449&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Local Mode will now work the same way as SageMaker does. Basically if you provide a content_type it will be passed to inputdataconfig.json. If you don't then there will be no ContentType key in the json file. It is up to your algorithm to define a default if it needs to.  This change makes it consistent with SageMaker.
