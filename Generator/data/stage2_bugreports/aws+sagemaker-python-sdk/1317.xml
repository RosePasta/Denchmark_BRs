	<summary>[bug] mxnet estimator requirements.txt stopped working</summary>

According to the documents,

requirements.txt could be loaded in mxnet estimators. This was the behavior when , but will trigger errors in .
Screenshots or logs
Error because the package is not installed, despite being specified in requirements.txt. No errors are observed with framework_version='1.4.1'.

System information
A description of your system. Please provide:

SageMaker Python SDK version: latest as of 2/29/2020
Framework name (eg. PyTorch) or algorithm (eg. KMeans): mxnet
Framework version: 1.6.0
Python version: py3
CPU or GPU: local_gpu and ml.p3.xlarge
Custom Docker image (Y/N): N

Additional context
I will be using framework_version='1.4.1' for the time being. A related issue is that framework_version='1.3.1' could not be loaded. Mxnet-1.3 was announced on 11/2018. I think there should be sufficiently many people wanting to use this version to reproduce old experiments. Why did we stop supporting already?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yifeim&gt;@yifeim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for using SageMaker. There was a bug in our  code that if your  is tarred into your model data in training step and you changed the  in inference stage, the  will get removed. This issue was fixed in this change: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/1352&gt;#1352&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can install the latest version of SageMaker Python SDK and try again. At the same time, you could also try putting your new entry_point script and requirements.txt under source_dir and provide its path.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/laurenyu&gt;@laurenyu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , my  is also not working now:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;code/
  main.py
  requirements.txt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

m = MXNet(entry_point="main.py",
          source_dir="code",
          role=role,
          train_instance_count=1,
          train_instance_type="local_gpu",
          framework_version="1.6.0",
          py_version="py3",
          hyperparameters={'batch-size': 64,
                           'epochs': 200,
                           'lr': 0.001})
Not sure if I'm following the recommended solution here. I'm on sagemaker=='1.51.3'.

 we recently released a bug in the images themselves - I've opened a PR to fix this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers/pull/261&gt;aws/sagemaker-containers#261&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		When can we use the latest image including the bug fix? I am still seeing the error; framework_version='1.4.1' works, but framework_version='1.6.0' does not work.

		we're are still waiting on the fix to be released. should be around the same time as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/issues/1371&gt;#1371&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Apologies for the delay.
in the meantime, as a workaround, you can use subprocess to make a pip call in your training script.

		The fixed images have been released (and verified while writing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-training-toolkit/pull/165&gt;aws/sagemaker-mxnet-training-toolkit#165&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Thank you for your patience!
