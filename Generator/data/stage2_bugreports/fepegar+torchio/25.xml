	<summary>save_sample from ImagesDataset</summary>
	<description>
When using the save_sample method from ImagesDataset
the nifti have a wrong dimention one should change
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        tensor = sample[key]['data']
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

by
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        tensor = sample[key]['data'].squeeze()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Not sure if this is the rigth place for this function, why not put it directly in io.py ?

		You're right that there was one dimension too many. I haven't put that one in io because I'd like to keep that module lower level, and this method is coupled with the dict format generated by ImagesDataset. Thanks!
