	<summary>ImportError: cannot import name 'Compose'</summary>

TorchIO version
'0.15.5'
&lt;--! Can be retrieved as torchio.__version__ --&gt;
I'm just trying to load imports work and my code snippet is
import torchio from torchio import AFFINE, DATA, PATH, TYPE, STEM from torchio.transforms import ( RandomFlip, RandomAffine, RandomElasticDeformation, RandomNoise, RandomMotion, RandomBiasField, RescaleIntensity, Resample, ToCanonical, ZNormalization, CropOrPad, HistogramStandardization, Compose, OneOf, )
When I try to run it, I get
Traceback (most recent call last): File "trial.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt; from torchio.transforms import ( ImportError: cannot import name 'Compose'
I think there is a problem with naming or function naming it's not working, also OneOf gives the same error

		I suspect there is conflict with torchvision but not sure

		Can you upgrade torchio and try again? I think Compose was added in 0.16.0 and you're using 0.15.5.
pip install --upgrade torchio
