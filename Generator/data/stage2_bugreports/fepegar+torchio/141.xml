	<summary>issue with affine transform</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Thanks for the nice augmentation tool. I am trying to apply on our dataset where the image size is 160 X 384 X 384 and voxel spacing is .7 X .36 X.36 mm. The error is coming for affine transform. The error is as follows:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test3.py", line 50, in &lt;module&gt;
    transformed=transform(sample)
  File "~/software/virtual/pytorch/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/torchio/transforms/transform.py", line 34, in __call__
    sample = self.apply_transform(sample)
  File "~/software/virtual/pytorch/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/torchio/transforms/augmentation/composition.py", line 28, in apply_transform
    return self.transform(sample)
  File "~/software/virtual/pytorch/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/torchvision/transforms/transforms.py", line 61, in __call__
    img = t(img)

    return super().__call__(sample)

    sample = self.apply_transform(sample)

    interpolation,

    default_value = get_borders_mean(image, filter_otsu=True)
  File "~/software/virtual/pytorch/lib64/python3.6/site-packages/torchio/transforms/augmentation/spatial/random_affine.py", line 195, in get_borders_mean
    array[:, :, -1],
ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (384,160) into shape (384). 
The affine transform is working for the given MRI image dataset  in TorchIO tutorial.ipynb tutorial. Also it is working if I pass default_pad_value='minimum' in the RandomAffine function. What could be possible processing, I need to do before doing affine transform ?
