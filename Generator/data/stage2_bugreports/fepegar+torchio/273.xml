	<summary>Inconsistent shapes of images</summary>
	<description>
üêõBug
The shapes of the images of CT scans vary from images
To reproduce
Versions above 0.17.15 will have a different output if reading in .mhd or dicom folders
print(torchio.__version__)
subject = torchio.Subject(
    CT = torchio.Image(path = "something here", type=torchio.INTENSITY),
)
print(subject.shape)
'''
0.17.10
(1, 512, 512, 345)
'''

'''
0.17.18
(345, 1, 512, 512)
'''

'''
0.17.14
(1, 512, 512, 345)
'''

'''
0.17.15
(1, 512, 512, 345)
'''

'''
0.17.17
(345, 1, 512, 512)
'''
Expected behavior
I expected the format in Channel x X x Y x Z but versions above 0.17.15 seem to follow a different format
Not sure if this is a bug or a feature
TorchIO version

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DerpyCoder&gt;@DerpyCoder&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks for reporting.
Recent support for 4D images is probably causing this behavior. I don't know how your images are stored. Can you share some examples?
You can change the way 4D images are read with the channels_last keyword argument of Image. By the way, you can now use ScalarImage and forget about type.

		I directly pass the path to the image (mhd) or folder (dicom) in the path keyword argument.
The dataset I am using to test this are the LUNA16 and the LIDC-IDRI dataset
The dicom images are stored in a folder like
01.dcm
02.dcm
03.dcm
The mhd files are in the same folder as their respective raw files
Are these images counted as 4D images though since they only contain a channel

		Changes in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fepegar/torchio/commit/349d771ac58dc84afaa72fb39270472a95d857f5&gt;349d771&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should have fixed this. Now, DICOM images are read with channels first by default so your results should be consistent in . Feel free to reopen if they're not.
