		Yes, definitely! I have very little experience with Sphinx and reStructuredText. It feels like fixing this should be easy, but I keep having trouble with this. For example, I'm not sure why the links to the classes in the first paragraph of the &lt;denchmark-link:https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/transforms.html#transforms&gt;Transforms&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 section don't work. I feel like there's a namespace problem, but I don't think using  is always the solution.
I've managed to make work e.g. the  link in &lt;denchmark-link:https://torchio.readthedocs.io/data/patch_training.html&gt;this page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, after taking a look at other projects.
Do you have experience with this / would you be able to contribute with this issue? That would be great! After setting up the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fepegar/torchio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst&gt;development environment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I do  to build the docs locally and check whether things look right.

		I don't have experience with Sphinx but I'm happy to give it a try. It does feel like it should be straightforward. Let me give it a go and I will get back to you soon!
