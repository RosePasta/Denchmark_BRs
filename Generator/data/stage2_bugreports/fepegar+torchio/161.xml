	<summary>Custom transformations applied to LABEL type</summary>
	<description>
Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fepegar&gt;@fepegar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for this great tool! I've used it today for the first time, and (almost) all functionality worked as intended.
I've stumbled upon a little problem with regard to custom transformations using torchio.transforms.Lambda. When using the function as shown in the docs example, e.g.
new_mask = Lambda(my_func, types_to_apply=[torchio.LABEL])
the function is never called for torchio.LABEL. With torchio.INTENSITY it works fine.
A look at the implementation (torchio/transforms/lambda_transform.py) showed that Lambda.apply_transfom() goes through images via sample.get_images(). However, get_images() has a default flag intensity_only=True. As such, only torchio.INTENSITY can be retrieved, making the option types_to_apply obsolete.
Is this intended behaviour? Thanks for looking into it!
