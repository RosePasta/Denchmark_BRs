	<summary>nptying in setup.py</summary>
	<description>
I just tried to create a minimal environment.yml for a project in which I also have GemPy.
Having:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;name: gallery

channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - ... all my conda dependencies
  - pip:
    - gempy
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

did not work. Turns out that it was missing nptyping
nptyping is specified in gempy/requirements.txt, but it is missing in gempy/setup.py. I think it should be included in the setup file.
