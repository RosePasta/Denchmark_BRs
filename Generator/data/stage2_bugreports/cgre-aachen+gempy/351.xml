	<summary>Change the degree of universal drift</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The functionality to switch between the degree of universal drift is not properly designed
for second order drift:
modify_kriging_parameters('drift equations',[9,9]) --&gt; modify_kriging_parameters('drift equations',[2,2]) (this is not woriking at the moment)
To Reproduce
Provide detailed steps to reproduce the behavior:
1.modify_kriging_parameters('drift equations',[9,9])
2.modify_kriging_parameters('drift equations',[2,2]) is not implemented at the moment
3.
...
Expected behavior
The user should just need to state what degree of universal drift they want but don't worry about the drift equations are 3 by 3 or 9 by 9

		Hi George, even though you are internal developer- can you fill out the form for the issue to give a little more context. It makes it a lot easier for everyone to keep track (and help). Do you plan on working on that yourself?

Hi Jan, Thanks for the comment. No, I am not going to work that by myself, actually, I created that just as a reminder for me and Miguel, after the conversation with him, maybe in some stage we will fix this. It is a simple function bug. I think the sentence itself is self-evident, anyway, as you have mentioned, I will add more details. Cheers
