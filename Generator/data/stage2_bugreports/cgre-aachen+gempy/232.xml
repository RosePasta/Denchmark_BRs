	<summary>kirging parameters reset after compute_model, set_interpolation_data</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I am running into an issue where the kriging parameters are overwritten to the defaults after running set_interpolation_data or compute_model
generally there is also little documentation about the parameters as well and how changing them modifies output models
To Reproduce
specifically, init a model with data, then attempt to run set_interpolationd_data any kriging data fields are now reset,
if kriging parameters are updated after setting the interpolator, most parameters stick, however after running compute_model any drift equations set are reset to defaults (I am attempting to override [3, 0] with [0, 0])
Expected behavior
once modified, kriging parameters should stay that way

		Yes, I was half aware of this.
I have it like this because it is difficult to control that if the user change the model all the kriging parameters update accordingly. Thank you for the extra analysis.
I guess that in set_interpolator I will add an argument to decide if setting them or not and in compute_model I will remove the call to set default values.
I hope to find some time at beginning of the year to sprint on all this minor bugs (or find someone who is willing to).
