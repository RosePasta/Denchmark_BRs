	<summary>Mismatch between fault block and lithology block next to faults</summary>
	<description>
Sometimes there's apparently a mismatch between the fault block and the lithology block near the fault surface. Probably related to the new gradient-based approach and the discretization.

Which can mess with topology:

		How do I give this a +1? This issues is messing with my approach :(

		So I think I solved the issue by adding more points to the fault surface. Before, I had all points in a "line", dipping parallel to the created fault surface. Now I added two lateral points, to include the strike-direction of the fault. Thus, I have 4 endpoints (can be imagined of the fault ellipse in a finite fault) and a few in the center. The mismatch is completely gone for me.
We will probably need to add an assert to make sure there are enough points defined to create a reliable fault/lith block.
