	<summary>color map swapped after computing model</summary>
	<description>

The color bar on the left color is not correct if without computing, in the first screenshot, the colour bar is blue, red yellow,, the correct order should be red, blue, yellow on the second screenshot. However, the datapoints colours are always correct! It is corrected after computing the model.

To Reproduce
Provide detailed steps to reproduce the behavior:
1.gp.plot_3d(geo_model,show_results = False, show_lith=False,notebook=False) before computing
2.sol = gp.compute_model(geo_model)
3.gp.plot_3d(geo_model,show_results = False, show_lith=False,notebook=False) again
...
Expected behavior
it is supposed to be consistent before and after computing.

		I found out there's a bunch of functions to set the orders in compute model, and in the document pointed out if one does not compute or recompute after a change, it could give a wrong result. So I will close this for now.
