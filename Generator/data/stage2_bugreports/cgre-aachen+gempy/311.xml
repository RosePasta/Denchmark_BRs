	<summary>All Pull Request Docs Checks fail</summary>
	<description>

All open Pull Requests have a failing check related to Sphinx documentation, e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy/pull/308/checks?check_run_id=473026979&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy/pull/294/checks?check_run_id=479273309&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
To Reproduce
Make a PR or just look at the Pull Request Docs Check / docs (pull_request) in any open PR.

Particularly with PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy/pull/294&gt;#294&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I would not expect any changes to how documentation is handled, yet &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy/pull/294/checks?check_run_id=479273309&gt;the check fails with a configuration error&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9367569/75666944-056b4080-5c77-11ea-8902-ee9432121a44.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Desktop (please complete the following information):
The remote build system used for all PR's

I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Leguark&gt;@Leguark&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned that some new checks were added for the GemPy retreat, so maybe this is related to a check we didn't have before.

		Yes, this was an action that I activated for 1 hour because apparently you cannot have actions that are not active. All the new commits do not go through that check
