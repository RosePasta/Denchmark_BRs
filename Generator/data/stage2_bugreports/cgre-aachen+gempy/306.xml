	<summary>Arbitrary sections are not defined as grid is not active</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When trying to plot an arbitrary section (gp.plot.plot_section_by_name()) that was defined earlier (after the model initiation and before modeling), the plotting function returns that no sections have been defined (see screenshot). By executing the command geo_model.set_section_grid(section_dict), only the "regular" grid is returned as active grid.
Expected behavior
The geo_model.set_section_grid(section_dict) should set the sections grid active as well so that sections can be plotted by name after the model has been computed.

		Workaround: The grid can be activated by calling geological_model.set_active_grid("sections")

No, it works now without setting the grid active manually.
