	<summary>Fix needed: Getting a single specific surface</summary>
	<description>
When a fault is present, at the moment you need to declare either potential_lith or potential_fault as None, depending on the type of surface you want to get (fault or lith).
Should be fixable by implementing asserts to check which type of surface you want to get.
Example of error when trying to get a fault:
