	<summary>Topography fails to load if model extent equals raster extent</summary>
	<description>

I have a model with an extent of [0,972,0,1069]. The respective raster hast the same extent with [0,972,0,1069]. When trying to load this raster into GemPy, the error below appears. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/endarthur&gt;@endarthur&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has narrowed down the issue to the fact that no  file is created.
To Reproduce
Load a raster as topography with the same extent as the model (1 m resolution) should cause the error
Expected behavior
A DEM of the same size as the model area should not fail to load

Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows 10
GemPy Version: 2.1.1 but still present in the latest version

		What does gdalinfo say for that file?  Mentions ArcGIS in the notebook - that seems to often break them in the past.

		It looks like it's the result of this if:



gempy/gempy/core/grid_modules/create_topography.py


        Lines 97 to 101
      in
      2339444






 if np.any(cornerpoints_geo[:2] - cornerpoints_dtm[:2]) != 0: 



 path_dest = '_cropped_DEM.tif' 



 new_bounds = (self.regular_grid_extent[[0, 2, 1, 3]]) 



 gdal.Warp(path_dest, self.dem, options=gdal.WarpOptions( 



 options=['outputBounds'], outputBounds=new_bounds)) 





I believe that adding a check with os.path.exists at



gempy/gempy/core/grid_modules/create_topography.py


        Lines 61 to 64
      in
      2339444






 if delete_temp is True: 



 self.dem = None 



 os.remove('topo.xyz') 



 os.remove('_cropped_DEM.tif') 





should probably fix that.
