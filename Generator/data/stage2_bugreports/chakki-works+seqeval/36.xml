	<summary>Error defining model with tensorflow.keras</summary>
	<description>
In both tensorflow 1.15 and tensorflow 2.x the keras callback does not work if the model is defined using keras from tensorflow, i.e.:
import tensorflow.keras as keras
this is due to the incompatibility of both improting keras directly and through tensorflow. But as far as I know, the later is the recommended way of doing so.
is there any way of making the latter compatible? I tried changing the importing line of your library and it didn't work.
