Please provide a detailed step by step procedure for installing seqeval from your repo. I also tried to install from .whl file available in pypi.org
seqeval-0.0.6-py3-none-any.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform This is the error that it is showing. Please let me know how to use it. Thanks.
