		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bruzat&gt;@bruzat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! I just did some tests on Firefox and it seems that this browser has some problems with rendering larger photos. We will investigate this problem and look for potential optimizations. In the meantime. I already have some ideas for improvements, but they will take some time to implement.
I recommend to switch to Google Chrome - no problems there. Everything runs smoothly.
