Describe the bug
While using your app I have noticed the following visual bug(visible in the attached screenshot).
When the browser's download bar is visible and listing downloaded files, the image is partially covering the project's title and two texts are overlapping.
I hope it was helpful for the project
All the best, keep it going, never give up bye :)

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lukasy09&gt;@lukasy09&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! Due to the large amount of bugs that we have managed to fix recently, we decided to make a small release marked with the tag . The same applies to this issue, which is now available at &lt;denchmark-link:https://makesense.ai&gt;https://makesense.ai&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Happy Labelling!
