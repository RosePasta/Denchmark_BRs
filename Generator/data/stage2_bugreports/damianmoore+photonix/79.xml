	<summary>Exif rotation data not being used when first importing and determining image width/height</summary>
	<description>
Width and height values stored in DB against a photo are sometimes switched around. This is apparent when portrait photos from Canon cameras are uploaded as the width is shown as wider than the height. This is also visible when viewing an object recognition bounding box in the PhotoDetail component.
The rotation information about rotations is currently used in thumbnail generation. This also needs to be used to calculate the dimensions when added to the DB.
