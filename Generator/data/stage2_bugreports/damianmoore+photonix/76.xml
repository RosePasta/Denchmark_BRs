		I have also had this error on Windows using Chrome and to add further information the original issue I solved by changing the version that was being installed in the DockerFile to 9.6.12-0+deb9u1. There were then further errors with the binding of the postgresql port as well that I changed from "5432:5432" to just 5432 also in the DockerFile which solved that.
I have still been unable to receive anything on localhost:8888 however so I haven't fixed the issue yet and am getting this output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;photonix    | Postgres is unavailable - sleeping
photonix    | DNS fwd/rev mismatch: postgres != unallocated.barefruit.co.uk
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thanks for the report @vague369. I'll update the Dockerfile when I next have a stable internet connection to test the build with.
