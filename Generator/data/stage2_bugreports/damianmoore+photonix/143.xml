	<summary>Bug with Apollo refreshing JWT token after some time away</summary>
	<description>
If you are logged in, close the tab and then open the page in a couple of days you get the following error. Refreshing the page clears the error, the user is still logged in and they can see all their photos.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error! GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: You do not have permission to perform this action GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable GraphQL error: 'AnonymousUser' object is not iterable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Think this is an error with the way Apollo Client is configured. It should refresh the token automatically if it is outdated.

		Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/damianmoore/photonix/commit/cfc7e9db7034a4bb231e57f3863d355c6a03e3c2&gt;cfc7e9d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. GraphQL queries were being run when JWT token had expired. Now there is a Redux store that holds the logged in user. The user gets set by  and Apollo  is skipped if this value is not yet set.
