	<summary>Location tagging is wrong in some circumstances</summary>
	<description>
Looking at my photos from Iceland, quite a few are tagged as Norway, Russia and Sweden. See if this is an actual bug or inaccurate GPS positions from the camera.

		Think this problem is a horizontal flip around Zero degrees longitude. A point showing in Norway should actually show as Iceland. These are about the same distance horizontally from London.
