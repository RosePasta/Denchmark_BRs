	<summary>Issue with repeating refining labels</summary>
	<description>

The first frame's label is not matched when repeating the refining labels.
It seems the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/353&gt;#353&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/374&gt;#374&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To Reproduce

Run deeplabcut.refine_labels(path_config_file)
In the GUI, load data, refine all frames, save, and click yes for repeating.
In the second data, refine the labels in the first frame, and go to the next frame. Go back to the first frame, and the labels were messed up and not at the manually refined positions.

Expected behavior
The previous data's last frame labels are not cleared, still remained, and affect to the next data's 1st frame. This issue consecutively happens - second data's last frame affects the third data's first frame, etc - during keep clicking yes for the repeating refining. Maybe the GUI issue.

Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):

OS: Windows 10
DeepLabCut Version: 2.1.6.2
Browser: both in chrome &amp; edge

Additional context
It did not happen when I refine data separately (close the GUI and re-run deeplabcut.refine_labels),  not repeated in the same GUI.

		Thanks a lot! I'll try this ASAP.
Also, found something in the committed file. Should change this
remove_data() function as following "delete_data()"?
