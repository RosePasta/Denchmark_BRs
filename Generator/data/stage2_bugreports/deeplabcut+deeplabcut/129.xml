	<summary>Windows only: relabeling GUI adjust marksize causes error (disables future label movement)</summary>
	<description>
Your Operating system and DeepLabCut version
Windows 10, conda env, DeepLabCut 2.0.0
Describe the bug
The refinement GUI will stop allowing the user to adjust the labels ONLY if the adjust labels button is used. For now, Windows users should avoid using the adjust labels section. This is working properly on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS systems!
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

in an environment, ipython, import deeplabcut, set path_config, and run deeplabcut.refine_labels(path_config).
Click on "adjust label size"
Now the user cannot adjust the position of the label.
No error is reported.

Expected behavior
That after adjust marker size - which should only be allowed ONCE on the first frame - the labels can be moved by a LEFT click+drag.
