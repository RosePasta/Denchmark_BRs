Describe the bug
ERROR in GUI “Train Network”, there is an error in "pose_cfg.yaml" --&gt; the "project_path" is not correct.
Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):

OS:  Windows10
DeepLabCut Version 2.2b8

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, i.e.:

Go to deeplabcut.launch_dlc(). After finish "Create training dataset", I choosed "Train Network". However it report the error:

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17546446/92683113-9e84bd80-f364-11ea-9378-9cb6b4e3390b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;



Than I opened the 'dlc-models\iteration-0\crossMazeSep10-trainset80shuffle1\train\pose_cfg.yaml', and saw the context in the pose_cfg.yaml.



The "project_path" is just the error, so I must manually corrected it everytime:



project_path: E:\cxf\crossMaze-FanLab-2020-09-10
