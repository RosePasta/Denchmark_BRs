	<summary>"specify the shuffle" using the GUI unable shuffle 0</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
After using the compare models (on 3 models:resnet_50, resnet_101,mobilenet_v2_1.0 ), the shuffle given to resnet_50 was zero.
In the next tracking steps, as in analyze videos or extract outlier frames, when I changed the shuffle to zero it immediately changed it to 1 as the minimum possible number is 1.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Use the GUI
Create a training set with 3 models to compare.
Try to analyze video with shuffle 0 using the GUI

Desktop (please complete the following information about your system):

OS: windows 10
DeepLabCut Version '2.1.6.2'

Many thanks in advance,
Shachaf.

		it does seem in Windows it defaults to "0" whereas in MacOS and Linux it starts at 1. We can change the GUI such that you can analyze videos with shuffle=0; n the future we should modify this behavior so that it is the same across OS. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jeylau&gt;@jeylau&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
