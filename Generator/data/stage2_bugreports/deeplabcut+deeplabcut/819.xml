	<summary>Issue using Lasso to swap label IDs on DLC 2.2b7</summary>
	<description>
Using Lasso to select a number of labels and then clicking on another animal's ID name to swap the ID of the labels has apparentely stopped working on version 2.2b7 (on windows). I can lasso the labels but when I click on the other animal's ID the ID of the labels does not change.
It was working fine on all previous versions.
