	<description>
hi, I'm looking into the code for model &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet/blob/master/bindsnet/models/__init__.py&gt;IncreasingInhibitionNetwork&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and is a bit confused about line 228-229:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;inhib = -self.start_inhib * np.sqrt(euclidean([x1, y1], [x2, y2]))
w[i, j] = min(self.max_inhib, inhib)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think it's used for initializing the weights w of connection, depend on the distance between two neurons.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;for i in range(self.n_neurons):
            for j in range(self.n_neurons):
                if i != j:
                    x1, y1 = i // self.n_sqrt, i % self.n_sqrt
                    x2, y2 = j // self.n_sqrt, j % self.n_sqrt

                    inhib = -self.start_inhib * np.sqrt(euclidean([x1, y1], [x2, y2]))
                    w[i, j] = min(self.max_inhib, inhib)

        recurrent_output_conn = Connection(
            source=self.layers['Y'], target=self.layers['Y'], w=w, wmin=-self.max_inhib, wmax=0
        )
        self.add_connection(recurrent_output_conn, source='Y', target='Y')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As the default initial value for start_inhib=1.0, max_inhib=100, but we expect the weights to be
negative numbers; you set a '-' for inhib and forget to set for self.max_inhib, that inhib will be negative and self.max_inhib is still positive, and this will make min(self.max_inhib, inhib)always equal toinhib.
In this way you might  want
w[i,j] = max(-self.max_inhib, inhib) ,
or maybe change both line to
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;inhib = self.start_inhib * np.sqrt(euclidean([x1, y1], [x2, y2]))
w[i, j] = -min(self.max_inhib, inhib)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I don't know whether my understanding is correct, could you have a look at it?

		Yes. You are right. You can create a PR. The second option is better since it is easier to understand.
