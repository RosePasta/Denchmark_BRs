	<summary>Sample models download for MXNet model inception_v3  and Darknet Model Yolo is broken</summary>
	<description>
OS and browser version: macOS 10.15.7 + Chrome Version 86.0.4240.80
Steps to Reproduce:


Click on MXNet model inception_v3 doesn't initiate download but redirects to a raw file page:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soeaver/mxnet-model/master/cls/inception/inception_v3-symbol.json


Click on Darknet Model Yolo yields the same result as above:

NB: All the other sample models work fine for both download and in-browser sampling.

		Default browser behavior for text files.

		For clarification, since this is expected behaviour shouldn't this be a persistent problem with all the sample files or am I missing something here? Are these sample files generated differently depending on the origin of the models? Sorry if I'm obtuse and missing something obvious (most likely scenario).

		They are in different formats. Some are binary files. Others are standard text formats browsers recognize and have a default behavior.

		I see, thanks for clearing that up. If I can make a UX suggestion it would be to separate those two models and have them in a separate section that makes it clear they can't be downloaded as the others but still used in the web app demo.
