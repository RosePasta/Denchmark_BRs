	<summary>PyTorch: Unknown expression 'dict' in the model</summary>
	<description>
Hi There
I encounter the following error when trying to visualize my model in netron. I dont have a way to reproduce the error for now but could you please confirm if the error is related to python dictionaries and if yes, are python dicts supported in netron ?
PS: I will try to reproduce the error in the near future.
Thanks

 Can you share a sample file to reproduce the issue?
