	<summary>Old releases are being deleted from PyPI</summary>
	<description>
It appears that old versions of this package are being deleted from PyPI. We have a server build which uses netron as a dependency but it will occasionally break because the version of netron that we pinned no longer exists.
Is there a reason that old versions are being deleted? We've been using this tool to visualize TFLite and the Python module is convenient.
Thanks!

		The goal is to eliminate suppport cost for outdated versions and maximize users participating in stabilizing the latest version.
