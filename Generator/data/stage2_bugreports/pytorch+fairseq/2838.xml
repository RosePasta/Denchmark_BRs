	<summary>Wav2vec 2.0 doing inference on newly trained transformer lm model gives missing key error</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi,
I trained a transformer LM model for inferencing in Wav2vec 2.0. It gave a similar error of getting None in args in model dict. Like in previous similar issue, I changed the value of state["args"] to state["cfg"]["model"] but the data key was missing in that. So again changed it to state["cfg"]["tasks"] where it gave a new error of missing key language_modeling.  It's probably a issue because of moving repo to hydra config. I tried to find a solution for this, but there is distribution of keys in different namespaces that are needed.
Can you look into it.  Mainly the error is arising from init method of fairseqlm in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/speech_recognition/w2l_decoder.py&gt;w2l_decoder.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
