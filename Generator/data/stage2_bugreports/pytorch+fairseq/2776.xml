I just tried to run exactly the same command on the latest version of fairseq and I don't see the issue. Could be fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/2761&gt;#2761&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you still see the issue, can you please get exact version of your fairseq and re-open this ticket:
git log -n 1

		Hi I keep on having this issue, as per my checks the issue arise when the fairseq installation is done by performing these steps for developing locally:
1)git clone &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq&gt;https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

2)cd fairseq
3)pip install --editable ./
in this case I do keep getting
argparse.ArgumentError: argument -s/--source-lang: conflicting option string: --source-lang
If i install fairseq by:

pip install fairseq
it works

as requested, here's the version obtained by &gt; git log -n 1

		BTW it does not happen if i clone the package_fairseq branch instead of the master branch.
In this case it works.
