	<summary>Generating Alignments take longer time than prediction on a GPU</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

--print-alignment takes too much time on GPU probably due to extract_hard_alignment in utils
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Run command in here.
Same command with --print-alignment takes around 3X the time.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


On CPU it takes only 70 ms to generate alignments for a batch size 32, beam size 5 and an average sequence size of 5.
On GPU it is supposed to take around the same time, but is around 250 ms for the same sequences.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
