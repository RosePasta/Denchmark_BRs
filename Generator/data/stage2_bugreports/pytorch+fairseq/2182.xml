	<summary>Validation happens after every epoch, validate_interval is ignored</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;🐛 Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I used to set the validation (epoch) frequency with --validate_interval. Currently on master validation is triggered after every epoch and i can't find a way to trigger validation only every x epochs.
Has there been a change that caused this behaviour? Is this wanted?
Looking at the code in master, I assume that train.py has been refactored from this:



fairseq/train.py


        Lines 103 to 106
      in
      9ac98bb






 if not args.disable_validation and epoch_itr.epoch % args.validate_interval == 0: 



 valid_losses = validate(args, trainer, task, epoch_itr, valid_subsets) 



 else: 



 valid_losses = [None] 





To this:



fairseq/fairseq_cli/train.py


        Lines 238 to 252
      in
      9f25ffb






 do_save = ( 



     ( 



 args.save_interval_updates &gt; 0 



 and num_updates &gt; 0 



 and num_updates % args.save_interval_updates == 0 



     ) 



 or (end_of_epoch and epoch_itr.epoch % args.save_interval == 0) 



 ) 



 do_validate = ( 



     ( 



 do_save # saving requires validation 



 or (end_of_epoch and epoch_itr.epoch % args.validate_interval == 0) 



     ) 



 and not args.disable_validation 



 ) 





And as we're always at the end of an epoch (L244), the argument validate_interval is basically ignored.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I should be able to trigger validation only every x epochs, but save epoch_checkpoints after every epoch.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Good point. We generally need a validation loss when saving checkpoints in order to set checkpoint_best.pt properly, but the old behavior kinda ignored this and allowed checkpoint_best to only get updated whenever validation happened to run.
I'll revert this to the old behavior.
