&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

OpenMP error on running fairseq-train (even with --num-workers 0 )
fairseq-generate works crash-free
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

RUN:
DATA_FOLDER=errorsim-pw1; ARCH=fconv; FOLDER=fconv_pw1_test2 fairseq-train ./data-bin/$DATA_FOLDER --lr 0.25 --clip-norm 0.1 --dropout 0.2 --max-tokens 4000 
--arch $ARCH --save-dir ./checkpoints/$FOLDER --no-progress-bar --log-interval 50 
--num-workers 0 --cpu
(--cpu can be removed if you have a GPU, and the error is the same with any value of --num-workers)

OMP: Error &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/13&gt;#13&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: Assertion failure at z_Linux_util.cpp(2361).
OMP: Hint Please submit a bug report with this message, compile and run commands used, and machine configuration info including native compiler and operating system versions. Faster response will be obtained by including all program sources.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


fairseq Version: 0.8.0
PyTorch Version: 1.3.1
OS: RHEL7
How you installed fairseq (pip, source): Using pip, as an editable
Build command you used (if compiling from source): git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq; cd fairseq; pip install --editable .
Python version: 3.7.5
CUDA/cuDNN version:
GPU models and configuration: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080
Any other relevant information: OpenMP version is 3.1
echo |cpp -fopenmp -dM |grep -i open prints "#define _OPENMP 201107"

This is a new-ish RHEL7 environment I'm trying to work with. So far whatever I've done with pytorch, fairseq, other libraries I'm using works fine.

		Maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/11294&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is relevant?  It looks like they've since pulled the packages from the registry, so maybe you can just try to upgrade the package?  Otherwise it looks like setting  helped others.

		Looks like a bullseye! Setting KMP_INIT_AT_FORK=FALSE helped me too. Gonna look into upgrading my Anaconda to see if that helps.
