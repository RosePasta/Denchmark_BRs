	<summary>Model can't locate bindings, even after installation</summary>
	<description>
I've successfully installed Python Bindings. :-
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;****@**-gpu:~/wav2letter/bindings/python$ pip install -e .
Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable
Obtaining file:///path/wav2letter/bindings/python
Installing collected packages: wav2letter
  Running setup.py develop for wav2letter
Successfully installed wav2letter
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Still  while running below command :-
****@**-gpu:~/wav2letter/bindings/python$ PYTHONPATH=/path/fairseq python3 examples/speech_recognition/infer.py /path/audio_file/wav2vec/ --task audio_pretraining --nbest 1 --path /path/audio_file/wav2vec_small.pt --gen-subset valid --results-path /path/audio_file/wav2vec/tmp/am/ --w2l-decoder viterbi --word-score -1 --sil-weight 0 --criterion ctc --labels ltr --max-tokens 4000000 --post-process letter
Getting below errors :-

Can you please suggest what might be the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alexeib&gt;@alexeib&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  . Thanks in advance.

		Just trying to help, I was having the same issue,
Running this unblocked me, it might not use CUDA though,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd /root/kenlm/build &amp;&amp; cmake .. -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON &amp;&amp; \
  make -j$(nproc) &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; \
# set no cuda
export USE_CUDA=0 &amp;&amp;\
export KENLM_ROOT_DIR=/root/kenlm &amp;&amp;\
cd /root/wav2letter/bindings/python &amp;&amp; pip install -e .
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 , thanks for your response. But my python bindings are already installed. See below
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;****@**-gpu:~/wav2letter/bindings/python$ pip install -e .
Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable
Obtaining file:///path/wav2letter/bindings/python
Installing collected packages: wav2letter
  Running setup.py develop for wav2letter
Successfully installed wav2letter
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And I've followed exact same steps, that you've mentioned.
But the issue when I'm running the code, I don't why but code giving errors that bindings are not installed.

		i think you must have solved this since you had a different error in another issue, right?
