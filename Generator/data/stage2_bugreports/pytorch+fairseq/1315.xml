	<summary>FairseqMultimodel doesn't have forward_decoder</summary>
	<description>
When I try to inference model, inheriting from FairseqMultimodel (I've created custom MultilingualLSTMModel with MultilingualTransformerModel as example) with either fairseq-generate or fairseq-interactive, it crashes, saying
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AttributeError: 'MultilingualLSTMModel' object has no attribute 'forward_decoder'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

There is no such method both in FairseqMultiModel and BaseFairseqModel (which is parent of FairseqMultiModel).
I suppose, the same issue will be with multilingual transformer, because both it and my class inherit from FairseqMultiModel.
