&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;❓ Questions and Help&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I wanted used "--criterion ctc_loss" instead of "--criterion cross_entropy_acc" and other parameters keep the same with examples/speech_recognition/README.md, I got a "TypeError: build_criterion() missing 1 required positional argument: 'task'" and I don't know how to fix this error

		+1, i get a same error after replacing "cross_entropy_acc" with "ctc_loss", and i doubt it is caused by the override function "build_criterion", since i have never seen it in "cross_entropy_acc"'s module. How can i use ctc loss?

		i rty to comment “build_criterion” in the CTC_loss.py, then i can build the model and criterion, However, fairseq raise another error;
'CTCCriterion' object has no attribute 'args'
which is similar as issue
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/issues/1802&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

So this is a bug?

		Thanks a lot, BTW, there maybe anpther bug, when i use the infer.py in /examples/speech_recognition, when batchsize greater than 1, e.g., bsz=2, a Exception will be raised as follow:
memoryError: cuda runtime error(77):an illegal memory access was encountered at...
however, it will be fine if i use batchsize=1, while it is really slow when predict
