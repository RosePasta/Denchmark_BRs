	<summary>Filter out trials for algorithms that cannot warm start</summary>
	<description>
ASHA and Hyperband may fail if they are warm-started on trials that they would not sample.
Or maybe we should make the algorithms ignore the trials they can reuse. Because they are also sensitive to points inserted by users which would break their schedule of trials (like ASHA and Hyperband).
