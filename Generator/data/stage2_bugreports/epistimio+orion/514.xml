	<summary>Trials from parent experiments can be duplicated</summary>
	<description>
If a trial exist in a parent, it's ID depends on the parent ID and therefore can be duplicated in the current experiment. Perhaps the trial ID should be based on the root id. But in such case trials that cannot be shared across experiments will be impossible to be sampled in current experiment.

		This issue was already partially covered here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Epistimio/orion/blob/develop/src/orion/core/worker/producer.py#L147&gt;https://github.com/Epistimio/orion/blob/develop/src/orion/core/worker/producer.py#L147&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
This is still sensitive to race-conditions however. For instance if 2 workers launch (w1 and w2), w1 goes with exp v1 and w2 branches to exp v2. w1 may sample a first trial while w2 is sampling, both sampling the same trial. This race condition can only be caught with unique ids, but that would required to ignore experiment id in the trial ID hash, making it impossible to sample identical trials in completely unrelated experiments.
This is the best solution we have so far. When we make the algorithm state bounce over workers instead of being replicated, then we will be able to solve this perfectly.
