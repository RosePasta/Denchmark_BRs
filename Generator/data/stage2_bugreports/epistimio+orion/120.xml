	<summary>Exception when launching hunt</summary>
	<description>
Some strange exception. What is happening there?
Before, I did orion init_only on a different machine.
$ orion -vv hunt -n omni26

		Yes it's a problem I run into yesterday. This happens when you try to run an experiment without script arguments but the database cannot be found in the database.
I will try to add a hook shortly to give a clean error message when this happens.

		The experiment cannot be found in the database. I might be wrong however.
The problem is the KeyError catch silenced &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mila-udem/orion/blob/develop/src/orion/core/worker/experiment.py#L543&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. You can add the following snippet in the except.
import traceback
traceback.trace_exc()
It will print a traceback once, that's fine and that is why the catch is there. The second time it fails however, and I predict it will, is indicative of what is wrong. Please print the output here. I can help with it.

		That's the second one right? Then it looks like it was not found in the database, 'user_args' would be set otherwise at the second time.
In a python shell, you can try
from orion.core.io.experiment_builder import ExperimentBuilder
experiment_view = ExperimentBuilder().build_view_from({'name': 'omni26'})
To see if the experiment exist, otherwise:
from orion.core.io.database import Database
database = Database(name='test', type='mongodb', host='....')
experiments = database.read('experiments', {})
print("\n".join(sorted(e['name'] for e in experiments)))

		I didn't have the chance to debug it much, but this looks like second traceback:

		ok, thank you for the log.
I started to write a fix for a better error message and a command to list the available experiments in the database. I'll be slowed down because of ICML but I hope I can make the PR before next week.

		Ok, the problem was that in docker I was under root account.
