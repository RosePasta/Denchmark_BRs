	<summary>ASHA promotes unfinished trials</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
ASHA promotes trials that are not yet completed in the next lower rung.
Expected behavior
From my understanding ASHA should not promote trials that didn't report a result.
Steps to reproduce
Use the following minimal dummy experiment script and make it executable:
#!/usr/bin/env python
from orion.client import report_objective
from numpy.random import randn
import time
time.sleep(120) # set this large enough to be able to start multiple workers
report_objective(randn())
# vim: set ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 expandtab:
Run multiple (for me it happened with 3-4) workers (clusterssh is very convenient for this) with
orion hunt -c planetgc_orion_config.yaml -n test_asha --worker-max-trials 5 test.py --epochs~'fidelity(1,64,base=2)' --learning-rate~'loguniform(.00001,.01)' --momentum~'uniform(.7,.95)'
Fetch trial details with the following python script:
from orion.client import create_experiment
exp = create_experiment(name='test_asha')
print(f"{'STATUS':^10} {'START':^30} {'END':^30} {'FIDELITY':^8} {'PARAMS_HASH':^35}")
print('-'*120)
for trial in exp.fetch_trials():
    print(f"{trial.status:&gt;10} {str(trial.start_time):&gt;30} {str(trial.end_time):&gt;30} {trial.params['/epochs']:&gt;8} {trial.hash_params:&gt;35}")
This produces the following output for me:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  STATUS               START                           END               FIDELITY             PARAMS_HASH

...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note, that the first and third row have the same parameter hash (identical configuration, except the fidelity dimension), but the third trial starts before the first has finished.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: e.g. 3.6.9
Or√≠on version: develop
Database: PickleDB

  only filters out trials that have objective , not those with objective , which seems to be the initial objective value for trials.

 just helped me find the issue in my config:
The strategy item has to be directly in the experiment section not in the subsection producer!
Thanks!

 I tried to reproduce the issue with the configuration
producer:
    strategy: StubParallelStrategy
But the strategy was correctly set. Could you confirm if it's still failed on your side? Normally it should work but give you the following exception:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;WARNING:orion.core.io.resolve_config:(DEPRECATED) Option `producer` is deprecated and will be removed in v0.3. Use instead the option
experiment:
  strategy: StubParallelStrategy
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Unfortunately, I can't run that experiment right now, but the config that failed for me was:
experiment:
    algorithms: 
        asha:
            seed: null
            num_rungs: null
            num_brackets: 4
    producer:
        strategy: StubParallelStrategy
You checked the code and told me that the producer section should go to the top-level of the config, which worked for me.
