	<summary>Comparison of Dimensions with same prior's name but different parameters returns True</summary>
	<description>
Let A and B be two instances of the Dimension class defined as follow :



Name
Type
Prior




x
Real
uniform(0, 10)


x
Real
uniform(0,1)



While it is evident that these two Dimensions are not equal (since they do not allow values on the same interval), the current __eq__ function for Dimension comparison returns True. This comes from the fact that the DimensionBuilder uses the expression passed through the command line (or a config file), for example, -x~uniform(0,10), and passes it through an eval call which uses the values inside the parenthesis as arguments to the function related to that distribution.
Unfortunately, this operation does not preserve the expression string.
