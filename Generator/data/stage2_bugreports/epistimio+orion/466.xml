	<summary>Global, env vars, local and command args are not merge properly</summary>
	<description>
When configuring different part with global, environment variables, local configuration and command args, parts of the configuration gets ignored. Part of the problem is that global object config (which includes env vars) is not used consistently since the refactoring of the experiment builder. We should add extensive functional tests to make sure these issues are detected and not re-introduced later on.
