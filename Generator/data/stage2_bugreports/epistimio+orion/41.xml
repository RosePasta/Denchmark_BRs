	<summary>Add index method to DB</summary>
	<description>
When a query is issued to MongoDB, where we ask for specific &lt;name, user&gt;, recent trials, completed trials, sorted top 10 result, mongo needs to iterate through the entire collection.  If we specify indexes on &lt;name, user&gt; for instance, it can use its built indexes to quickly fetch documents matching &lt;name, user&gt;.
The choice of indexes is basically a compromise between efficiency and memory consumption.
Note: Specifying &lt;experiment name, user&gt; as a unique index will fix a race condition bug in the experiment creation.
