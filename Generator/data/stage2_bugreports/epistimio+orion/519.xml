	<summary>EVC fails if parent algo requires an algo that is no longer installed</summary>
	<description>
When building the view of an experiment, the algorithm is instantiated. This will fail however if the algorithm is not installed in the current setup. This algorithm should not be required for views as they are only meant as a view for their trials and configuration. The algorithm should not be instantiated for views. Maybe the same goes for the strategy.
