<bug id='394' author='vmichals' open_date='2020-05-24T23:42:11Z' closed_time='2020-09-22T17:25:40Z'>
	<summary>Configuration in working-dir is empty</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I specified a working-dir to orion hunt and it creates subfolders for the trials, each with two files results_*.log and trial_*.conf.
After a trial is completed the corresponding results file contains the result, but the configuration file remains empty.
Expected behavior
The configuration file should contain the trial's hyperparameter configuration.
Steps to reproduce
Call orion hunt with the --working-dir argument.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: e.g. 3.6.9
Or√≠on version: develop
Database: PickleDB

		Hey, sorry I missed the notification! I believe it was this configuration:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;experiment:
    algorithms: 
        asha:
            seed: null
            num_rungs: null
            num_brackets: 4
    strategy: StubParallelStrategy
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vmichals&gt;@vmichals&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , do you still have the issue with latest develop version? I would close this issue otherwise. Thanks!
