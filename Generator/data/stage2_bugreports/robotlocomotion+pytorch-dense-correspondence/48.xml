	<summary>Use same normalization when displaying color maps for two different images</summary>
	<description>
Currently it normalizes each image &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/peteflorence/pytorch-dense-correspondence/blob/af145643e3fc50bd570c02493e635d916973844d/dense_correspondence/evaluation/plotting.py#L12&gt;independently&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
This means that comparing images visually is not very meaningful.

		Yes good to create issue on it. If we are comparing across multiple scenes we might even want to normalize with min/max from all the images plotted in a single notebook
