As we said - just to tracking it. We try out Ubuntu System in Virtual Box on windows 10. By the way - what is our wish or goal? we plan to pack them into nuget packages and reference them - right? or shall we allow user to install manually?

		I think pack into NuGet will be more convinent for users. We will run it in Debian docker, so it's necessary to  support linux.

		Agree - I will check again how we do it in NumSharp (the LAPACK) and will package it for Tensorflow libs. Just thinking if we should create a separate project (repository) or if we should make a separate project inside Tensorfow.NET. maybe first go with keep in Tensorflow.NET.

		Yes, keep it in TF.NET

		Hm interesting. With TensorFlowNET.Native in future we will try out Native Lib or do you plan to extend the C API? Just ask for understanding. :)

		Hm, won't do. Just for testing some function which is hard to migrate from C++/ Python.
