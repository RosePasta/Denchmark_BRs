 do you know if you had available space on machine? Is there any else specific about your machine configuration that might make this fail? I wasn't able to reproduce

, I actually have about 96G on my machine. If I change to another country with a different bounding box, it works, but it just did not work for  if you and Mark could create and fetch the data without the problem, I think we could close this issue up.

		Ah sorry, I actually had a failure in another window. I can reproduce. The file is likely too large after unzipping to read/write properly in the currently implementation.
