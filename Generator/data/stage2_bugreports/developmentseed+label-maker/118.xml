	<summary>Can't Produce Segmentation Data</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I was trying to produce a segmentation data on an area in Philippines with the configuration below. label-maker download command creates the mbtiles and geojson files. However when I try to produce the labels and images, label-maker just creates empty folders. Where do I do wrong? I have installed mbviewer and made sure that the region that I downloaded contains labels.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;{
  "country": "philippines",
  "bounding_box": [121.464843728242,18.312810843256784,121.50878904073498,18.354525525951416],
  "zoom": 12,
  "classes": [
    { "name": "Landuse", "filter": ["has", "landuse"] },
    { "name": "Roads", "filter": ["has", "highway"] },
    { "name": "Building", "filter": ["has", "building"] }
  ],
"imagery": "http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.satellite/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic2thcmFrdWxhayIsImEiOiJjam54Z3YwaDYwMGhkM3FwY3BmeG1lZHd5In0.dAFYUvWpcw7katdB9xeBSg",
  "background_ratio": 1,
  "ml_type": "segmentation"
}

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 just checked it out and I can confirm that I'm seeing the same issue. I'll mess around with this for a while and update soon. Thanks for the bug report!

 Looks like there is a  thrown by one of the geometries and it silently causes the tile processing section to fail. I'll add some handling for that to fix this

		I have tried with the latest code but still getting no labels:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;serkan@serkan-HP-ubuntu:~/temp_geo$ label-maker labels
Determining labels for each tile
TopologyException: Input geom 0 is invalid: Self-intersection at or near point 9 247 at 9 247

 it still isn't merged in yet. If you want to try it out now, you can install directly from the repo () on the branch . Otherwise, we'll have a new release early next week

		I got same problem.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TopologyException: Input geom 0 is invalid: Self-intersection at or near point 226 179 at 226 179
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Analogical errors appear with other bounding boxes.
Is this bug or my mistake?

, check your (multi)polygon/geometry, when it was created, some bow-tie/intersect was accidentally created.

		Hey Nick,
It's been a while and I don't remember how I solved that particular issue.
However I made some changes with the label-maker which worked for me in the
end. Perhaps you might wanna go through the commits here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/skarakulak/label-maker&gt;https://github.com/skarakulak/label-maker&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Also you can clone the fork and try to get the data with your bounding box
with this modified version. My solution was kind of a quick hack, and it
changed the default behavior of label-maker which might result in undesired
behavior in other tasks other than segmentation. So I didn't open a PR for
it.

Sorry for not being more helpful. Let me know if this doesn't solve the
problem or if you have any questions regarding the changes that I have made
in the fork.

Best,
Serkan

 I don't understand what I should do. This is my bounding box: [1.09725,
 6.05520, 1.34582, 6.30915]

 I use Colab for downloading images for segmentation. How I can install your fork in Colab?

 the problematic geometries sometimes come directly from OSM or when they get chopped up by our tiling. It will show the warning but skips the geometry and should continue from there.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NickElixir&gt;@NickElixir&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are you still getting results after seeing that warning?

, I got some but less now. Does this error mean that I skip tags?
I see that dataset is not full and not balanced.
The problem is that probability of error per tag is not random.

 it's possible to fix the underlying geometries first then load as a GeoJSON but that's a bit of a pain. When you say that you're getting "less now" (I assume labels), less than when?
