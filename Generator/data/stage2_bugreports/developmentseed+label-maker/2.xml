	<summary>Commands will fail if terminal pwd isn't in `/label-maker`</summary>
	<description>
This fails:

Breaking on this relative filepath &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker/blob/master/label_maker/validate.py#L4&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This works:
~/Builds/label-maker $ label-maker download
Probably need to at least add something to the docs, but probably fix it so it's more agnostic of pwd
