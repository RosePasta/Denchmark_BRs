	<summary>local variable 'intersection' referenced before assignment</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
When running ssd300_training.ipynb, I get the error:local variable 'intersection' referenced before assignment. This is caused by the if condition in line 66 in ssd_box_encode_decode_utils.py which doesn't handle the third (and default) case: centroids.
Thanks
