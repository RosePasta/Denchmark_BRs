	<summary>Potential bug for SearchSpace length</summary>

 if self._length is None: 





here, when _length is None, then initiate it to current search space length, it's almost good most of times, however if user/developer get len of search space when space is empty, then a unreasonable _length 1 will be produced( the result of empty list for np.prod is 1), so it's better for adding an extra condition such as " len(self.space_map.values()) != 0" . :)
