	<summary>'Could not compute output Tensor' error when Iâ€˜m using clone_model()</summary>
	<description>
Hi guys, I think I just met a bug.
There was something wrong when I was using multi_gpu_model with cpu_relocation=True. After analyzing the traceback I think it is a bug inside keras.models.clone_model
The script below can reproduce it
from keras.models import Model, clone_model
from keras.layers import Input, Add, Lambda
from keras.utils import multi_gpu_model


def build_model():
    input_layer = Input(shape=(1,))
    test1, test2 = Lambda(lambda x: [x, x])(input_layer)
    add = Add()([test1, test2])
    model = Model(inputs=[input_layer], outputs=[add])
    return model


if __name__ == '__main__':
    model = build_model()
    model = clone_model(model)
    # model = multi_gpu_model(model, cpu_relocation=True)  # it uses clone_model when set cpu_relocation=True
If I didn't make any mistake, the script will raise AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor("add_1/add:0", shape=(?, 1), dtype=float32)
My environment:

Keras 2.2.4
tensorflow 1.12.0

I met the error on both 4 GTX1080tis and my own laptop with a GTX1060MQ
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I noticed that output_masks here will always be [None](but [None, None] is expected)



keras/keras/models.py


         Line 157
      in
      a139716






 for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, 





and that's because layer.compute_mask(...) will always return None since Lambda doesn't support using masks



keras/keras/models.py


         Line 153
      in
      a139716






 output_masks = to_list( 





So if I'm using a functional model with a layer which has more outputs without a mask support, I think the error can appear.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

P.S. thanks a lot for your brilliant works :)
From my perspective, Keras is an amazing gift to everyone. Thank you all!

From the Keras team and all the contributors, you're welcome!
Thanks for the very nice report. I'll flag this as a bug. I'm not very familiar with multi_gpu_model so I hope someone else will have the time to look into it.
If you have an idea on how to fix the issue, feel free to do a pull request, pull requests usually get much more attention than issues.

Thanks for applying. I just commited a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/12205&gt;#12205&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 minutes ago. It's my pleasure! :)
