System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using example directory):



I used the default code exactly as written.




OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise


TensorFlow backend (yes / no):
yes


TensorFlow version:
1.13.1


Keras version:
2.2.4


Python version:
Python 3.7.3


CUDA/cuDNN version:
None.  I'm using cpu-only vanilla keras installed by Anaconda.


GPU model and memory:
NVidia Quadra P1000


Describe the current behavior
It crashes when I hit F5 in Spyder.  It talks about pickle error.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;using TensorFlow backend.
Loading data...
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "&lt;ipython-input-1-4a5d5f4a1034&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;

    x_train, labels_train = f['x_train'], f['y_train']

    raise ValueError("Object arrays cannot be loaded when "

ValueError: Object arrays cannot be loaded when allow_pickle=False
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Describe the expected behavior
I would expect it to get to line 29 and print something about the training sequence count.
Line 28, where it is choking, is
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=max_features)
It doesn't get to print "train sequences" after attempting to load data, so it isn't getting past line 29.
When I re-select line 28, and hit F9 (run highlighted) it gives the same error again.
Code to reproduce the issue
You already have it.  It was literally copy-paste-run-crash
Other info / logs
Traceback is included in what it did.

		This is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13359&gt;bug&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with numpy 1.16.3 where allow_pickle=False. For the time being can you please downgrade your numpy version to 1.16.2 . This should execute the script successfully.
