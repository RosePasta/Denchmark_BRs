 Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps


 If running on Theano,... (I'm running on tensorflow)


 Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).


I successfully ran  from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commit/7e2e7a5e5a43443122df0b497f88dd77fd3bfc7c&gt;7e2e7a5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on my GTX1080 with a TensorFlow R0.12rc0 backend. I then ran  and got the following failure:

Help or feedback from anyone is welcome, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/antonmbk&gt;@antonmbk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you may be interested in this because you contributed the example. Thanks!

		I can confirm. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/antonmbk&gt;@antonmbk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thoughts?

		This specific issue is due to the example being written under the assumption image_dim_ordering="th" (it should be made compatible with both modes). However, this is not the only issue with TF. There are further bugs.
		</comment>
		<comment id='3' author='ahundt' date='2016-12-13T07:10:23Z'>
		The other bug is that the model is taking the gradient of a gradient, which isn't supported for all ops in TF. In particular MaxPool.

		<comment id='4' author='ahundt' date='2016-12-13T07:13:19Z'>
		If this isn't easily fixable, then the example should include a check for the current backend and raise a helpful exception with TF. Also, start with K.set_image_dim_ordering('th').

 would a feature request issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for MaxPool gradient of a gradient make sense?

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ahundt&gt;@ahundt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 yes it would, you should post one.
For the time being, I have "fixed" the example by doing what I mentioned above.

		Looks like there is already an issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6143&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#6143&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

With a pull request in progress:

		Just seeing this, thanks for bringing it up &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ahundt&gt;@ahundt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  I'm hoping the tf people fix this in that PR you mentioned.

		pull request update:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/6664&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#6664&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

hopefully the relevant day is getting closer... should this perhaps be reopened since the real fix doesn't seem too far away?

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/6664&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#6664&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is merged to master so maxpool grad grad should work, can this be reopened? Will a tf version check be appropriate so the error message appears only when appropriate?
