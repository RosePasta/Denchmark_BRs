	<summary>Evaluate reconstruction on disparity, not depth</summary>
	<description>
Comparing reconstructions based on the raw depth is not ideal and can read to problems as disparity goes to zero and Z becomes really noisy, since Z = bf / d.
We should compute disparity (from input, from LIDAR, from raycast) and compare disparities.
This would also allow us to actually use a meaningful unit of measurement instead of just and arbitrary pixel representation of a scaled depth map.
DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE THE DOCS ACCORDINGLY!
Suggestions:

Check out https://www.eth3d.net and the associated paper to see how they eval depth
Check out the paper assoc. with the KITTI 2015 stereo bench (Obj SF for autonomous driving, 2015) to see how they evaluate depth. Hint: they care about disparity, NOT the depth.
