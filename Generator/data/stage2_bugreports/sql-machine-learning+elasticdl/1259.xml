	<summary>Evaluation minibatches may be calculated repeatedly</summary>
	<description>
Currently, each task contains multiple minibatches. In the evaluation phase, workers calculate each minibatch in turn. Every time a minibatch calculation is completed, the worker immediately passes the calculated evaluation metrics to the master. When the worker completes all the minibatches in a task, the worker tells the master the results of the entire task.
If a worker A is killed in the process of calculating a task, the master will find another worker B to calculate the failed task, but it will not clear the metrics of the minibatch already calculated in the task. So some minibatches are calculated both by worker A and worker B, which will lead to errors in the final evaluation metrics.

		Interesting. I think workers should report results per task as the task is the minimum unit watched by the master.

Agree. In evaluation phase, worker should report results per task.
