	<summary>[üêõBUG] Sparse dropout disabled during evaluation?</summary>
	<description>
PyTorch currently doesn't have sparse dropout &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/35798&gt;pytorch/pytorch#35798&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I see that it's being emulated here 


RecBole/recbole/model/general_recommender/gcmc.py


         Line 437
      in
      cedd7ea






 class SparseDropout(nn.Module): 




 and 


RecBole/recbole/model/general_recommender/ngcf.py


         Line 35
      in
      cedd7ea






 def sparse_dropout(x, rate, noise_shape): 





Regular PyTorch Dropout is disabled when model.eval is called because training is set to false on the model 


RecBole/recbole/trainer/trainer.py


         Line 362
      in
      511cda8






 self.model.eval() 





Are these emulations of sparse dropout being disabled somewhere during evaluation?
