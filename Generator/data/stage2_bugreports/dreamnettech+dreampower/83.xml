	<summary>Dreampower does not find checkpoints when run outside of its directory</summary>
	<description>
I have added the folder c:\dreampower to my Windows PATH environment variable so that I can type dreampower in the CLI from anywhere. However it throws the error that the checkpoints can not be found and need to be downloaded. I believe this is a bug.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Download DreamPower prebuilt v1.2.3 for Windows (GPU)
Extract it and add the folder to your Windows PATH environment variable
Go to some other folder like desktop and type dreampower
See error

Expected behavior
It should find the checkpoints relative to itself and not the current process directory. (cwd) However it should not look for the input image itself in its own directory. The whole point is that I can run this in another folder.
Enviroment

Version [1.2.3]
OS: [e.g. Windows 10 1803]

Additional context
v1.0.0 works fine.

		use the -c parameter to indicate the folder the checkpoints are located if not in the default location of ./checkpoints
