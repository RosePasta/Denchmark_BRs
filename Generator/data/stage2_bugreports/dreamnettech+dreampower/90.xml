	<summary>Can’t reach 100% CPU load</summary>
	<description>
Can’t reach 100% CPU load neither with these: --n-cores=2, 4, 8
Even selected 8cores only goes up to 53% CPU load peak (33% average).
No SSD operation is happening at that time.
Which means wasting time by not fully utilizing the CPU.
Is there a bottleneck in the code?
To Reproduce
Simple run: --auto-resize --n-cores=4  (no CUDA)
Enviroment (please complete the following information):
PC: intel i5 Windows 10 x64 (2cores, 4 logical CPUs)
Python 3.6.7
latest SW checkpoint

		Sorry for the late reply, the --n_cores parameter is used only in two processes:

To process several frames at the same time for gif and video.
To process OpenCV masks (Small usage)

So it is normal that the CPU usage is low, the important part of the algorithm (GAN) does not support multi threading for now.
