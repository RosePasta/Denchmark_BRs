	<summary>Color Correction Algorithm Is Influenced by Removed Garments</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When using the color correction option, the subject of the transformation will be corrected to match the color of the removed garments. For example, the skin of a person wearing a red shirt would turn red after the transformation.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Turn on color correction
Perform a transformation on an image with a colorful shirt
See error

Expected behavior
The skin tone to match the original image when using color correction

Enviroment (please complete the following information):

Dreamtime 1.2.1
OS: Windows 10 1903

Additional context
This is just conjecture and I haven't actually examined how the algorithm functions, perhaps this issue could be fixed via setting the parts of the image identified as clothes to transparent in both the before and after images before feeding them into the color correction algorithm, then using the difference in hue to modify the original output,

		The color correction algorithm is in DreamPower so I will move this issue to the project.

		The color correction is a 3rd party algorithm that takes everything from the input image.
It's a stop-gap solution until the new checkpoints are trained up that do not have the color issues.
