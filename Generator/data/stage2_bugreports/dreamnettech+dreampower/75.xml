	<summary>Update error</summary>
	<description>
Says update available: 0.0.1 but update button doesn't work.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Go to checkpoints
Click on update
Scroll down to Dreampower update available
Click on update
See Update failed
There was a problem trying to download the update, please verify that you are connected to the Internet. If the problem persists try to configure or temporarily disable your Firewall/Antivirus/VPN.

I don't have any firewalls or antivirus up and am obviously connected to the internet.
Can't use without updating.
