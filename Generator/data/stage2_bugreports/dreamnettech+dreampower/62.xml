		In order to help you correctly you need to share the PKGBUILD file you are using. What's I can guess from error is, you are using setup.py with --pip_user in virtualenv. This option make pip install use --user option and this not possible to do so in a virtualenv.  Again it's the best guess I can do until you share the PKGBUILD.
