	<summary>Weird pixels on vag</summary>
	<description>
For me the current release almost always generates weird pixels on vag area, usually green/yellow colored. Using default parameters. It never happens for boobs. I'm already using split colored background. Happens for square images too.
Is it because of low quality jpg saving at one of the stages?
