	<summary>No picture is produced</summary>
	<description>
Whenever I try using the app, the picture is processing smoothly, but afterward I get hit with this error:
"DreamPower has reported that the photo has been transformed but the file does not exist! This may be due to a problem saving the photo, verify that DreamPower has write permissions and that your Antivirus is not detecting false positives. It is also possible that DreamPower is ending abruptly due to a major problem."
What can I do to fix it? It does have write permissions, antivirus isn't detecting anything...

		Check if there are any characters in the installation path that may trip up the process.
Try to use only [a-z] and [0-9] in the path name.
If for example your username has other characters in it, then try installing the app in the root folder ( C:\  for Windows OS for example ).
