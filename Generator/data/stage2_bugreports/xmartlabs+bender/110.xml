	<summary>Tests fail in iOS 11.3.1 on iPhone 8+</summary>
	<description>
In iOS 11.3.1 the tests for the Concat and LocalResponseNorm layers fail in iPhone 8 and iPhone X.
They work in iOS 11.3 (to my understanding) and also if run on iPhone 7 or below.
I am not sure this is a Bender or an iOS issue.

		I haven't tested this on an iPhone 8 on Xcode 9.4. We reported the issue to Apple.

		FWIW I noticed similar issues with my own compute kernels on the iOS 11.3 beta on A11 devices.
Edit: The issue was largely related to using ushort values in the compute kernels. With uint everything worked fine. According to Apple this should be fixed in iOS 12 but I haven't tried it yet.

		Thanks for the comment &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hollance&gt;@hollance&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I haven't tried this on iOS 12 either but as you said this should be fixed in iOS 12. However, we were told that they might not fix it for iOS 11.x. It might be worth to see if changing ushort's to uint's fixes our issues.
