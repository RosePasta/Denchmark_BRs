	<summary>Cannot pickle types such as metrics</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Users may encounter the following error when trying to pickle the objects with generic types, such as Texar metrics (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/asyml/texar-pytorch/blob/master/texar/torch/evals/metrics.py&gt;https://github.com/asyml/texar-pytorch/blob/master/texar/torch/evals/metrics.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), as shown in the following stack trace:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1015991/92966959-740b3100-f446-11ea-89b5-8ac46996c383.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is a known bug in Python 3.6 when pickling the genric types &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/python/typing/issues/511&gt;python/typing#511&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Workaround&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The easiest way to get around this is to upgrade to 3.7, which fixes this problem here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/6216&gt;python/cpython#6216&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Action needed.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

However, we may consider providing workarounds in Texar. It is also suggested to add unit tests on serialization for affected classes including the metrics class.
