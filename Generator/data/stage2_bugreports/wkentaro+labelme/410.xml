	<summary>Save after Undo results in corrupted JSON file</summary>
	<description>
If I start annotation, create 2 shapes, then press ctrl+Z and save, it results in a JSON file with:
"flags": null
Such a file causes error when you opening it as flags is expected to be dict &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/blob/master/labelme/app.py#L961&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In general it is caused by the fact, that in many some flags is expected to be dict, but in other plases it is assigned by None. So it is nessesary a) to open files sabed before (with "flags": null) and b) remove this ambigulity
