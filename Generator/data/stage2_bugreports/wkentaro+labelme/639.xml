Edit:
I am using the same erroneous dataset as charlieLehman below, so that is the cause of the error.

		I don't think this is because of the suffix..., but not sure why

		I just reproduced this and found something else related.
In the above video auto-save is used.  If auto-save is not used then a new JSON file is not created.  Instead the imagePath is altered to the overflowed name.
Arch Linux
Python 3.8.2
Labelme Version 4.2.9
EDIT:
The issue isn't directly caused by labelme.  If the json has a different imageDir than the filename and the imageData is populated then this effect will be caused by all of the different ways filenames are created in LabelMe.
Maybe something to enforce the imageDir to match the filename regardless of the presence of imageData?

I think it's inconvenient to be enforced imageDir to be same as the directory of JSON file.
A lot of people are already using it, anyway
