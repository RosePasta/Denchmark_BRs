	<summary>labelme2coco.py not clear error messages, and cannot handle certain images[BUG]</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
the assertion regarding __ignore__ missing from labels.txt is very unclear..
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Create a folder with an annotated image and its annotation
create a labels.txt, minus the __ingore__
try to convert to COCO

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "labelme2coco.py", line 165, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "labelme2coco.py", line 74, in main
    assert class_name == '__ignore__'
AssertionError
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


then fix that by adding the __ignore__
retry to convert to COCO
Get an error about converting images

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/anaconda3/envs/labelme/lib/python3.7/site-packages/PIL/JpegImagePlugin.py", line 612, in _save
    rawmode = RAWMODE[im.mode]
KeyError: 'RGBA'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "labelme2coco.py", line 165, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "labelme2coco.py", line 96, in main
    PIL.Image.fromarray(img).save(out_img_file)
  File "/anaconda3/envs/labelme/lib/python3.7/site-packages/PIL/Image.py", line 2134, in save
    save_handler(self, fp, filename)
  File "/anaconda3/envs/labelme/lib/python3.7/site-packages/PIL/JpegImagePlugin.py", line 614, in _save
    raise OSError("cannot write mode %s as JPEG" % im.mode)
OSError: cannot write mode RGBA as JPEG

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
It isn't very clear here how to fix this error/assertion

		I am unclear why does it need to write the file?  Why not simply copy the image ?

		I can see now, for the RGBA problem there was a supposed fix.. now trying to figure out what version that comes in
