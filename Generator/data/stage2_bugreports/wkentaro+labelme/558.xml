	<summary>Typo of your name Bibtex reference on the README.md</summary>
	<description>
Just wanted to point out that it appears you've spelt your name wrong in the bibtex entry when I went to use it.
Thought you might want to correct so people can cite you correctly :)
Very grateful for your software and was nice and easy to use for my master thesis.
