	<summary>adding points to circles and rectangles crashes</summary>
	<description>
Hi, there is possibly a bug allowing to add points to rectangles and circles. When an attempt to add a point is made, the program crashes.
The issue can be easily reproduced, choose any rectangle or circle, right click on one of its points/vertices and try to add a point.
The menu option to add points to rectangles and circles is disabled when one clicks on their edges. It should probably behave equally when clicking on the shape points/vertices.
