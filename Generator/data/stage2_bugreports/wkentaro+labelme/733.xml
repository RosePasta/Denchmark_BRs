	<summary>[SOLVED] Failed opening Image Files: Cannot open Labelfiles</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I want to open existing Labelfiles, which were created on a different computer but with the same labelme Version, but I get "Error opening file: a bytes-like object is required, not 'NoneType'. Make sure C:/.../f12720.json is a valid label file."
In Anaconda Prompt it also says "label_file:load_image_file:52 - Failed opening image file". The image path given here is correct and exists and when I put it into the Windows explorer, it opens the correct image.
When I copy the folder containing images and labelfiles into Documents it works as expected, so I think the error could be something with the limited pathlength in windows?
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Start labelme
Click on 'Open Dir' and choose the directory defined in the json-file under 'imagePath'
Click on 'Change Output Dir' and choose the coresponding directory with json-files
See error

Expected behavior
Load saved Labelfiles and display them on the images
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows10
Labelme Version 4.5.6

		It seems like it is actually a problem of windows and its pathlength. Enabling win32 long paths within the Local Group Policy Editor solved it for me
Here's a guide on how to do that:
