	<summary>How to run labelme_json_to_dataset</summary>
	<description>
I use windows 10 and install  labelme by conda.
I can use command labelme but I dont know how to use command labelme_json_to_dataset. When I type it on cmd, it tells me such command does not exist.

		Maybe this is the same problem as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/issues/45&gt;#45&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/commit/91154a74e3584967c3e531ecb0078d2a1179366f&gt;91154a7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes this issue.
Could you try it?

Hi there,
I am running labelme_draw_json and labelme_json_to_dataset on my mac, but neither of these two work. Both show a " Command not found ". Cloud you help me with this?
I installed through homebrew and command labelme works fine. Only these two(for now) do not work.
