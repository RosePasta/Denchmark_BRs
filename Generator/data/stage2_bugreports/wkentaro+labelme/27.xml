		when merge two pionts the program will exit too.  in this case, could you show a warning or  some otherthings rather than exit the program?

  can you check which version sub version of qt you are using?
If you are using pyqt4 then never mind but if you are using pyqt5=&lt;5.6  then ev.inverted() in the weehlEvent fucntion will throw an Attribute error. Since inverted() is introduced in 5.7

HI wkentaro, I used pip install -U labelme to update labelme, and  there have some more issues:


maybe little error, about '' activate labelme'' the step 2 based on Anaconda, when install actually should use 'activate lablme' which loss 'e'.


pip install -U labelme
have new problems:



Rolling back uninstall of scikit-image
Command "D:\ProgramData\Anaconda2\python.exe -u -c "import setuptools, tokenize;file='c:\users\lilia\appdata\local\temp\pip-build-jsy53g\scikit-image\setup.py';f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(file);code=f.read().replace('\r\n', '\n');f.close();exec(compile(code, file, 'exec'))" install --record c:\users\lilia\appdata\local\temp\pip-izcvne-record\install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile" failed with error code 1 in c:\users\lilia\appdata\local\temp\pip-build-jsy53g\scikit-image\
i suppose it must be something wrong when install scikit-image, but after i install scikit-image successfully, the same issue occurs, do you have some ideas about this issue?

		If you're sure that all dependencies are already resolved, you can run pip install -U labelme --no-deps.

		Or pip uninstall labelme &amp;&amp; pip install labelme.
