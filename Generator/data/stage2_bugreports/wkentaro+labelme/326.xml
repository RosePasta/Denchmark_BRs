	<summary>PyInstall : labelme.exe does not execute anything (proposed fix)</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
when building, labelme.exe using pyinstaller and launch hit. the program do not execute anything. Indeed the .spec file specifies that script main.py must be executed but this file does not contain code about this.
So adding
if __name__ == "__main__":    
    main()
at the end of main.py solve the problem for me.
There is perhaps an entry-point option in .spec pyinstaller file to specify main.py:main as function to start.
