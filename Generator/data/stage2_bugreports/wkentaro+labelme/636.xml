	<summary>[BUG] Crash on editing a polygon label when new value is not in the label list</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I edit the label on a polygon if the new label is not in the list of labels, the app crashes.
However, if I create a new polygon with the new label, I'm able to change the label on other polygons to the new label. The output of the crash:
Traceback (most recent call last): File "c:\users\aksha\miniconda3\lib\site-packages\labelme\app.py", line 921, in editLabel item.setData(role=Qt.UserRole, value=shape.label) TypeError: setData() takes no keyword arguments
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Open a directory with labelme annotations
Try to edit the label on a polygon shape, to a value that is not a part of the label list

Expected behavior
The app should allow editing labels to any value even if it's not a part of the label list.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows 10
Labelme Version 4.2.9
