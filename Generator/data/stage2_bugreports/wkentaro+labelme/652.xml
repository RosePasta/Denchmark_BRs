	<summary>[BUG] cannot see the delete file icon</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Hope you are all well !
I cannot see the "delete file" icon as per the screenshot below.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkentaro/labelme/master/examples/instance_segmentation/.readme/annotation.jpg&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

How can I activate it ? Is there a specific flag for that ?
Cheers,
X

		I see. I can also find that in my environment.
I don't think there's any flag or something.
It may be your env-specific like the icon cannot be loaded or not installed properly.
