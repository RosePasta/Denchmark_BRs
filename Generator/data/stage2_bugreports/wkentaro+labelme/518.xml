	<summary>2 minor remarks: flashing when zapping through, saving keep-prev</summary>
	<description>
Hi I am currently using LabelMe to go through frames of videos and I wanted to mention that my eyes would love it if the old image would stay in place until the next video is loaded, at the moment I have a split second of grey background everytime I advance.
It might be a hussle to make this change tho, so that wouldn't be worth it then.

		Also it would be useful if one had an additional option to not only autosave, but also autosave labels from --keep-prev - previous images, (except one deletes them.)
At the moment I have to move every box a little.
