	<summary>problem viewing mask using labelme_json_to_dataset</summary>
	<description>
Hi.
the utility looks great.
however, I was unable to view the mask saved to the *.json file.
I tried running
labelme_json_to_dataset , but got the following messege:
'labelme_draw_json' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
I ran the anaconda installation and the GUI works fine.
Thanks

		Do you run on Windows? Actually, I've never run labelme on Windows, because I only have mac or Ubuntu os.
