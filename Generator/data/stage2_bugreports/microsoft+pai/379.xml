	<summary>consult the setting of IP in service-deployment</summary>
	<description>
Thanks
I am a beginner on kubernetes. There has some confusion about the ip settings in service-deployment.
rest_server_uri: http://10.0.3.9:9186
    # root url of the k8s apiserver
    k8s_api_server_uri: http://10.0.3.9:8080
    # root url of the webhdfs api server
    webhdfs_uri: http://10.0.3.9:50070
    # root url of the prometheus server
    prometheus_uri: http://10.0.1.9:9090
    # root url of the k8s dashboard
    k8s_dashboard_uri: http://10.0.3.9:9090
    # root url of grafana
    grafana_uri: http://10.0.1.9:3000
    # root url of the web portal
    webportal_uri: http://10.0.3.9:9286
I know 10.0.3.9 is the ip of master. but 10.0.1.9 ï¼Ÿ
Another question , how many machines are needed in our pai at least?  Dose the master node not run specific work with gpu?

		For the question about the number of machines: You should have at least 1 infra node to run the master service (Include kubernetes master component, GPU is not required ) and at least 1 worker node (Both GPU or no GPU node are ok. Hadoop-ai will detect the gpu when starting. And Based on the information, schedule your job) to run worker service. Note that you should correctly configure hdfs's replica according to your cluster size.
For the address 10.0.1.9  is an issue. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/YanjieGao&gt;@YanjieGao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  could you solve it? And please pay attention to the port of prometheus, it conflicts with k8s-dashboard.
