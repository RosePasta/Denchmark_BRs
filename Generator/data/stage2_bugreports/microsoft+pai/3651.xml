	<summary>pai webportal logout with AAD could not redirect to login page</summary>
	<description>
When user enter pai webportal without login, the url should redirect to login page. However currently the redirect does not work.
Reproduce step:

go to vnext webportal url: &lt;vnext_url&gt;/home.html
if you in a sign in status, click sign out
the page could not redirect to index page
if you did not sign in before, the page is supposed to redirect to index page to let you sign in. However it did not work.

As a result the browser stuck in this page:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8444268/65134609-1f9dc300-da37-11e9-80da-150f30a98af9.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
