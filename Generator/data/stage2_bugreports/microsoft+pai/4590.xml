		Same here. Since error is svn not found, a simple solution is to add apt-get install subversion in script/service-boot.sh, for example, at Line 44.

		apt-get install subversion could fix it, but the svn is only included in master and v1.0.1 instead of v1.0.0.

 Could you share the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/pai/blob/v1.0.0/contrib/kubespray/example/config.yml#L3&gt;branch_name&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you used in config?

branch_name: pai-1.0.y

Thanks for reporting. It's suggested to use v1.0.0 which points to a specific commit and won't change, instead of pai-1.0.y.

 pls help to fix your docs accordingly.

 I found this problem can't be resolved by changing the doc. Because in quick start script config, there is setting like . So the code used during deployment is always .
Add &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ydye&gt;@ydye&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for help.

Thatâ€˜s my design. If you change to v1.0.0, than this version will be used.
