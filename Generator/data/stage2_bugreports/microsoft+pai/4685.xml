	<summary>PUT Request becomes GET</summary>
	<description>
How to reproduce:

PUT http://&lt;url&gt;/rest-server/api/v2/groups

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7499023/86994989-71882300-c1da-11ea-9936-1ea0cfe30abd.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The rest-server receives a GET:

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7499023/86995068-ab592980-c1da-11ea-9393-426634573bba.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Https doesn't have this problem.

		It's the client which changed http method from PUT to GET after received 301 status, &lt;denchmark-link:https://serverfault.com/a/434210&gt;reference&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

It's the client which changed http method from PUT to GET after received 301 status, reference.

This behavior is confusing for api users. Can we return a 404 not found for those who are using http?

		301 is the http standard for &lt;denchmark-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301#:~:text=The%20HTTP%20response%20status%20code,received%20for%20should%20be%20updated.&amp;text=The%20301%20redirect%20is%20considered,users%20from%20HTTP%20to%20HTTPS.&gt;redirecting http to https&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, 404 is more confusing for other users.
