	<summary>dev-box is not carrying the corresponding code, as the image tag indicated</summary>
	<description>
dev-box:v0.10.1 was supposed to carry the code of release v0.10.1.
The currently implementation is not right:


dev-box has a defalut 'CMD'
CMD ["/usr/local/start-script.sh"]


The script would checkout the latest release, now is v0.9.1, which is not expected.
TAG=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/pai/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/') &amp;&amp; git checkout $TAG


For the dev-box:v0.8.3, it would checkout v0.9.1, it's not right too.


I manually updated the dev-box:v0.8.3 and devbox:v0.9.1, pushed to dockerhub.

		Should it be added to release process?

		I think so, before we fix the issue we will need to manually build dev-box.
Here's my fix for v0.10:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;FROM openpai/dev-box:v0.10.1

RUN rm -f /usr/local/start-script.sh
RUN cd /pai &amp;&amp; git fetch --tag &amp;&amp; git checkout pai-0.10.y
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
