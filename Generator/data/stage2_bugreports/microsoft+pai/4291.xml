	<summary>[VSCode] PAI_VSC extension conflict with python-jupyter extension</summary>
	<description>

In the error callstack for this issue it looks like OpenPAI is hijacking the node-fetch command, I'm not entirely sure what it's doing there, but that looks to be what's causing the issue:


Note in this callstack our code calls into the @jupyterlab services. But then it goes into the node-fetch lib from this openpainvscodeclient, which is where the error comes from and has nothing to do with our extension.

Here is the issue in python extension
