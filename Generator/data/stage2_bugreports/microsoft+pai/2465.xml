	<summary>Webportal job detail page won't show jobs submitted through API v2</summary>
	<description>
Short summary about the issue/question:
Current webportal job detail page won't show jobs submitted through API v2 while previous one will.
Anything else we need to know:
The rest api can get job list and detail through API v1 correctly, the only difference is config format.
