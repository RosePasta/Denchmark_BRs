	<summary>Alert if Pod keeps in deleting after timeout</summary>
	<description>
:
Pod may not be deleted if its node unreachable.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/force-delete-stateful-set-pod/#delete-pods&gt;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/force-delete-stateful-set-pod/#delete-pods&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We need to at least alert this and let cluster admin to take actions, such as:

The recommended best practice is to use the first or second approach. If a Node is confirmed to be dead (e.g. permanently disconnected from the network, powered down, etc), then delete the Node object. If the Node is suffering from a network partition, then try to resolve this or wait for it to resolve. When the partition heals, the kubelet will complete the deletion of the Pod and free up its name in the apiserver

We can leverage existing OSS solution to detect and send this alert.
