 's method works, and I deployed grafana at int bed &lt;denchmark-link:http://10.151.40.234/dashboard.html&gt;http://10.151.40.234/dashboard.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , it fix qingcha's issue, but occurs another issue: if we don't use pylon to access dashboard &lt;denchmark-link:http://10.151.40.234:9286/dashboard.html&gt;http://10.151.40.234:9286/dashboard.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , it can't show grafana.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hwuu&gt;@hwuu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested that we shouldn't let services rely on pylon, for we can remove pylon anytime if needed. So we should figure out a better way to solve this issue?

 , yes, grafana shouldn't rely on pylon.

		Link of Dashboards -&gt; Home is configured in
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v4.6.3/pkg/api/index.go#L88&gt;https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v4.6.3/pkg/api/index.go#L88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

which comes from setting.AppSubUrl, calculated from Grafana's root_url global configuration.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v4.6.3/pkg/setting/setting.go#L190-L204&gt;https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v4.6.3/pkg/setting/setting.go#L190-L204&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

At present, when root_url is set in either config file or environment variable, it cannot be changed during the runtime, by our request URL in the browser.
So assume that we can only view Grafana from webportal, we can unified the uri of grafana in webportal and grafana, or, either environment configs works:
Without pylon
- webportal:
    - GRAFANA_URI: `http://hostname:3000/`
- grafana:
    - GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL: `http://hostname:3000/` # Current, default
With pylon
- webportal:
    - GRAFANA_URI: `http://hostname/grafana` # Configs in this issue
- grafana:
    - GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL: `http://hostname/grafana` # Which I recommends
If we need to support both http://host/grafana/ and http://host:3000/ works at the runtime, perhaps we should write a customize Grafana plugin to mock it?

		There is another workaround is that disable webportal dashboard display in grafana area of webportal dashboard. It will keep the Grafana's Dashboard -&gt; Home link to the webportal dashboard when it is opened by user in http://host/grafana/

		Sorry for mislead the error cause, I found that the GRAFANA_URI of environment variable in web portal is configured correctly, as http://hostname:3000/. And it works fine by port 9286.
On port 80, the configuration of GRAFANA_URI is sub-filter-ed by pylon. which replaced http://hostname:3000/ with http://hostname/grafana. Although pylon also replaced the base href in grafana page with http://hostname/grafana/, Grafana resolved "Home" link as "/", which drops subdirectory of base href, resolved into http://hostname/
So it cannot be totally fixed in web portal, any good idea? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hwuu&gt;@hwuu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Yes. This should be handled by Pylon. I will fix.
