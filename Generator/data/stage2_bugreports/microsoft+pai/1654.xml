	<summary>Job resubmission works only once</summary>
	<description>
Thanks to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/pai/pull/1448&gt;#1448&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, now job resubmission, i.e., clone feature is available.
However, when I tried to resubmit again, it fails.
For example,

submit a job &lt;A&gt;
stop job &lt;A&gt;
clone job &lt;A&gt; and resubmit job &lt;A-clone&gt; with the same job name =&gt; succeeded
stop &lt;A-clone&gt;
clone job &lt;A-clone&gt; (or &lt;A&gt;), and resubmit &lt;A-clone-clone&gt; with the same job name =&gt; Failed

The error message on web dashboard is like "Job name XXX already exists."
Is this expected behavior? I think a reasonable behavior is one of these two:

Fails at step 3. (when resubmitting the job with the same name), or
Step 5. succeeds (2nd resubmission also succeeds)

Thanks,

		agreed, one approach is to apply timestamp for the clone to avoid name duplication.

		PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/pai/pull/1532&gt;#1532&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will resolve this issue.
And answer &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sotetsuk&gt;@sotetsuk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 's question, before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/pai/pull/1532&gt;#1532&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 landed, it is the expected behavior, if the job you cloned in step 3 is not created by yourself (or created before 0.8.0). Currently in 0.8.0, different users are able to have the job with the same name. So what you did in step 3 is cloning the  to  while step 5 is cloning the  to , which causing the naming conflict.
