	<summary>network metrics are displayed incorrectly</summary>
	<description>
Previous before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/pai/pull/1418&gt;#1418&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the network metrics  and  means how many accumulated bytes of data are transfer through network interface, so Grafana uses &lt;denchmark-link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#irate()&gt;irate&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 function to extract how many bytes are transferred in that time. But since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/pai/pull/1418&gt;#1418&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . we have changed the way how network metrics are collected, the meaning of network metrics turned into how many bytes are transferred in that time, so Grafana doesnâ€™t need to use irate function anymore.
Should change all related grafana usage.
