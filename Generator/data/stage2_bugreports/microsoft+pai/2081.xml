	<summary>paictl.py service: can't start service after stop, need to try 'stop then start' for several times</summary>
	<description>
How to reproduce:

Stop a PAI service using: paictl.py service stop -n service_name
Start the PAI service using: paictl.py service start -n service_name

It won't work the first time. Take pylon/resource-manager for example, the daemon-set would up, but the pod won't be created.

		This should be a problem of kubectl or k8s, please provide more message.
