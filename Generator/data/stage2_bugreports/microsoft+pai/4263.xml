	<summary>PAI become unavailable when users open too many job detail-pages</summary>
	<description>
Currently, PAI job-detail page will auto-refresh every 10 seconds. When user submit too many job instances, every refresh will take a long time to retrieve data. And this will block other requests send to rest-server
Options to solve this problem:

Disable auto-refresh in job detail page
Add cache in rest-server
Add PAI service alert. When PAI become unavailable, rest-server will consume more than 4GB memory and cpu usage is over 100%. Maybe we can trigger an alert for this. (Collecting rest-server logs will also helpful)

		In the short term, I suggest to:

 do not retrieve GPU index when querying job details
 Disable or increase the interval of auto-refresh when number of containers is larger than 64
 Exponential back-off auto refresh when API call is failing
