	<summary>fuse_bn_into_conv optimizer in pypi linux wheels is wrong</summary>

 are some onnx models, where  is the original model,  is the model  after optimizing and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/daquexian/onnx-simplifier&gt;simplifying&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on ,  is the model after optimizing and simplifying on .
The "1523" tensors of the last two models differ a lot, which is caused by the onnx fuse_bn_into_conv optimizer. The tensor in ubuntu model (no matter produced by onnx 1.5 or 1.6) is totally wrong while the macOS version is right.
However, if I compiled and install onnx from source on ubuntu, the optimized model is correct and the same as that on macOS.

 yes, I just verified it still exits on onnx 1.7.0 installed by  on linux. what's more, if I installed onnx by  (which builds onnx from source instead of installing the prebuilt binary), the problem disappears
