	<summary>Backend test runner doesn't honor SequenceProto inputs/outputs</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Bug Report&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Noticed that the onnx backend test runner doesn't have logic &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/5cc790e03b2af691c55926a11c116eb9edaa689b/onnx/backend/test/runner/__init__.py#L298&gt;in place&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to handle s in the model's test inputs/outputs. Currently, it assumes that everything is a TensorProto. There are exisitng node tests that use sequences as inputs/outputs (for example: if_seq, loop13_seq, sequence_insert_at_front, sequence_insert_at_back) that is unable to be handled by the runner.
This change added support for s : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/2581&gt;#2581&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
