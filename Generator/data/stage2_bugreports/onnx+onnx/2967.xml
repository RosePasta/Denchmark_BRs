convert from caffe model to tensorflow model
tensorflow version 2.1.0
onnx version 1.7.0
Successfully convert from caffe to coreml to onnx using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx-docker/blob/master/onnx-ecosystem/converter_scripts/caffe_coreml_onnx.ipynb&gt;caffe2onnx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/OnnxTensorflowImport.ipynb&gt;onnx2tensorflow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i got the error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "convert_caffe2onnx2tf.py", line 36, in &lt;module&gt;
    tf_exp = prepare(onnx_model)  # prepare tf representation

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Anything to resolve this?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wonderzy&gt;@wonderzy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Based on the error message, I guess maybe it's related to this issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2655&gt;#2655&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
It has been fixed by this PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/2901&gt;#2901&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
You can try to convert it again with the master branch of onnx.
If it still cannot be fixed, I will suggest you to open an issue in onnx-tensorflow to get the best help since this error occurs in the converter. Thank you.

 Even i am facing the same error with YOLOv3 model when converting onnx to tensorflow.
I have onnx 1.3.0
onnx-tf 1.3.0
tensorflow 1.13.1
Torch 1.3.0
Could u pls guide me in solving this?

 Using the latest onnx from master branch might help.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jcwchen&gt;@jcwchen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I tried using master branch but it worked well for Torch==1.3.0 but failed on Torch==1.5.0
any idea on this?
The version history of modules are as follows..
onnx==1.6.0
onnx-tf==1.6.0 (not available through pip install;so installed from master branch)
tensorflow==1.15.0
torch==1.3.0
torchvision==0.4.0
opset==11

		It's better to use the master branch of onnx with the latest pytorch (&gt;=1.6.0), but I think the master branch of onnx is compatible with pytorch (1.5.0) as well. What is the exact failure?

		<comment id='7' author='wonderzy' date='2020-09-17T07:08:06Z'>
		Yeah...Im getting this error with Torch==1.5.0
Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 2 for 'Tile_229' (op: 'Tile') with input shapes: [19], [2]
Also,i have few more doubts on Tensorflow..Could u help me in solving this? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jcwchen&gt;@jcwchen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Im trying to convert Mobilenetv3 onnx model to tensorflow.
I need tensorflow==1.12.0 for my inferencing.
I searched all over to find the onnx and onnx-tf versions corresponding to tensorflow==1.12.0
Could you please suggest me the compatible versions of onnx,onnx-tf and torch for my required tensorflow version?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/padmasreenagarajan&gt;@padmasreenagarajan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
So this error occurs while using onnx-tensorflow? (This error message comes from tensorflow)
If so, I suggest you open an issue under onnx-tensorflow to get the best help. I am not familiar with onnx-tensorflow and you can check with onnx-tensroflow folks to understand which version is compatible with .
As far as I know, both tensorflow and onnx support Mobilenetv3 and yolov3 (at least for the latest version)... If an error happens in the converter, I would say it is more likely a converter issue. Sorry that I cannot be more helpful.

		No &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jcwchen&gt;@jcwchen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ..
This error occurred with torch==1.5.0 for YOLOv3 model
The tensorflow query i posted is regarding Mobilenetv3 which is completely different.
Anyways i will post this query under onnx-tensorflow section.
Thanks for your time and reply!
Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jcwchen&gt;@jcwchen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
