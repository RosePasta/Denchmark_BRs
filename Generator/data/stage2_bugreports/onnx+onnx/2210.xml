	<summary>The rank for "depth" input of OneHot operator is unclear</summary>
	<description>
In the doc(&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#onehot&gt;https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#onehot&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), the "depth" input for OneHot operator is declare as a scalar, but in the unit tests the value for "depth" is a 1D tensor. And in the def.cc(&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/onnx/defs/tensor/defs.cc&gt;https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/onnx/defs/tensor/defs.cc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), I find code that verify the "depth" input need to be a single-element vector.
May someone please clarify what is the rank for depth, if it is a scalar, the rank is 0. But if it is a 1D tensor with one element then it is rank 1.

		The spec says depth is a scalar so it should be a scalar.
You are right the tests and current shape inference is misleading. I will update both to reflect the spec.
However since right now shape inference allows 1D tensors of length 1 ... disallowing this without op version change will potentially break any existing models... In light of this I will keep the current check too.
