		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tlk2abhishek&gt;@tlk2abhishek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Yes it's a known problem in pytorcn-onnx converter. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/25088&gt;pytorch/pytorch#25088&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I saw you noticed that issue, too. Track there makes more sense. Thanks!
