Hello, I try to run your code, but there is a problem:
File "../ext/voxelmorph/src/losses.py", line 17, in binary_dice
vol_axes = 1 + np.range(ndims)
AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'range'
Can you tell me which version of numpy is used for this project，thanks

		This actually seems to be a bug in our part. My apologies I'm not sure when it was introduced.
can you change vol_axes = 1 + np.range(ndims) to vol_axes = list(range(1, ndims+1)) ?
