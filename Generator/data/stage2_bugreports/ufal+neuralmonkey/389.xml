	<summary>Lazy dataset should test files exist first</summary>
	<description>
LazyDataset opens the files only when it's asked to get a batch or series. If the files do not exist, it fails the first time feed_dict is called. It should test the file existence in the __init__ method instead to tell the user the file does not exist as soon as possible.
