	<summary>Cannot import 'Levenshtein'</summary>
	<description>
Cannot import 'Levenshtein' when trying to run pylint on evaluation.py. This means that a package is missing in requirements.txt.

		Now it says No name 'ratio' in module 'Levenshtein'. Is python-Levenshtein the correct package?â€‚Do we need a specific version?

, you should not close an issue (particularly if it is not you who opened it or you who wrote the code in question) unless you verify that it is resolved.

		the package is correct (&lt;denchmark-link:https://rawgit.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/master/docs/Levenshtein.html#Levenshtein-ratio&gt;https://rawgit.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/master/docs/Levenshtein.html#Levenshtein-ratio&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and dir(Levenshtein) lists ratio as one of its members.

		This is strange, pylint keeps complaining on both computers I tried this on. I decided to locally disable the warning until this is solved.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jindrahelcl&gt;@jindrahelcl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, you also said that you added the requirement, but you did not actually push any commit...

		Anyway, pylint is complaining about it on my computer, too..

		You could have checked the packages in prepare_env.sh script which I keep maintained. Now (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/commit/19488567d126fcbfa227a3a198c31b66aeb6405f&gt;1948856&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) it uses the requirements.txt.  I made a new clone, installed the requirements and it seems to be all right.
