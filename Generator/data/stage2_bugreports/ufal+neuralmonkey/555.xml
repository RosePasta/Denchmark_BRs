	<summary>Vocabulary includes words with unicode whitespace but does not load them</summary>
	<description>
Currently (tested on 0.2.2), if unicode whitespace "\xa0" is in a document, it is included in the vocabulary. If you save this to disk as a wordlist, and then load it again for test time (with neuralmonkey-run, these words are not part of the loaded vocabulary, and it will result in an error, since the loaded vocabulary size does not match the size of the word embedding matrix.
A fix could be to change the from_wordlist function to strip only the end-of-line symbol from the line, and nothing else:
Line 77 in vocabulary.py would become:
line = line.strip('\n')
This fixes the issue. Alternatively (or additionally), we might not want to include such items in the vocabulary in the first place.

		Stripping only newline sounds reasonable. User himself/herself should take care of the trailing whitespaces during data preparation.
Please create a pull request with a suggested fix so that we can close this issue.
