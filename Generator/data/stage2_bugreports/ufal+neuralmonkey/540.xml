	<summary>Bug in vocabulary truncation</summary>
	<description>
There is a minor bug in the  method in the  module on lines 366 and 367 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/blob/master/neuralmonkey/vocabulary.py#L367&gt;https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/blob/master/neuralmonkey/vocabulary.py#L367&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The bug may cause non-deterministic behavior of the vocabulary initialization when there are special symbols among selected words_by_freq[:-size] because they are left out and therefore the size of words_to_delete may vary (max 4 tokens diff).
Solution of this should render the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/pull/539&gt;#539&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 irrelevant.
