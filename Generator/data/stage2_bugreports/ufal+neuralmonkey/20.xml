	<summary>Postprocessing bug</summary>
	<description>
When I ran my  configuration, it failed on some error with lambda wanting two arguments, but just one was given. I solved this in my branch by removing the second (unused) argument of the lambda on line 36 in learning_utils, but I'm not sure whether this does not break anything else. Can you have a look at this, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jindrahelcl&gt;@jindrahelcl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
Edit: The correct lambda was on line 155, but maybe they should be the same?

		Yeah, that's OK. I was removing the second argument which was the whole dataset and which was unused everywhere else, but I did not try that without a postprocessor. Merge this to master, please.
