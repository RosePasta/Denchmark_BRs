	<summary>Variable files are being deleted</summary>
	<description>
If save_n_best is greater than 5, only 5 variables.data.X remain. The rest is being continuously deleted. For example, when save_n_best = 20, these are the variable files left in output dir after training:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;variables.data.14
variables.data.16
variables.data.17
variables.data.18
variables.data.19
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note 15 is missing, probably because 14 was better.

		This is most likely due to TensorFlow's Saver max_to_keep property which defaults to five.
