: Does beamsearch ever work? I will deal with this, but I'd like to fix my test script first. Is it possible to read a configuration and set a random seed before the computation is graph is build?

 It does and it give 2 additional BLEU points in the MMMT task. The configuration is loaded in two phases. First it just creates a dictionary of the values and in the second phase all the functions are called (which includes building the graph).
