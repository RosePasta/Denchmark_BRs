	<summary>Bug when writing summaries</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
for the MinRisk trainer I have a slightly different decoder that is used only with the MRT is executed. The original decoder.py I let for the runner and the Xent trainer. The translation.ini is here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/StoyanVenDimitrov/neuralmonkey/blob/with_new_decoder/examples/translation.ini&gt;https://github.com/StoyanVenDimitrov/neuralmonkey/blob/with_new_decoder/examples/translation.ini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But when I try to write scalar summaries fir the MRT loss, which I also enabled in the MR trainer, it comes to a problem. Even though the decoder for the MRT should be different, I get InvalidArgumentError (see above for traceback): You must feed a value for placeholder tensor 'decoder/train_inputs' with dtype int32 [[Node: decoder/train_inputs = Placeholder[dtype=DT_INT32, shape=[], _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/cpu:0"]()]]  which is strange, since decoder must be decoder_for_mrt. When I disable the summaries for the MR trainer in learning_utils.py it works normal.
Any ideas?
