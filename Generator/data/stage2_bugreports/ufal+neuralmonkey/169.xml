	<summary>decoder should be in its variable scope</summary>
	<description>
decoder does tf.get_variable_scope().reuse_variables() on the default scope which means any subsequent calls to tf.get_variable are looking for existing variables. This will interfere with any parts of the model that are created afterwards.
