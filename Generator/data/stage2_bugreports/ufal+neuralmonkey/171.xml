		Are you sure it was because of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/pull/152&gt;#152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? My &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/pull/151&gt;#151&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 refactor brought so many bugs, I would suspect it may have happened there as well.

		It stopped working before the merge of your refactor. I have mentioned it somewhere.
