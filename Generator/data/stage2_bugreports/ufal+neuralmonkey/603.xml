	<summary>pad_to_max_len doesn´t work</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I set pad_to_max_len in the AutoregressiveDecoder, but it doesn´t work. Any ideas?
Best,
Stoyan

		Hi, what do you mean?
Padding to maximum length is turned off in the decoder (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/blob/master/neuralmonkey/decoders/autoregressive.py#L308&gt;https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/blob/master/neuralmonkey/decoders/autoregressive.py#L308&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). You are saying that setting it to  does not work (e.g. you don't get the same shape of the input tensors)? In that case, there could be a bug in the vocabulary, but I doubt it..

		Hi,
yes, I set it to True, but the inputs are still cut to the length of the longest input in the batch. I just switched to the current NM Version, with the 0.2.1 pad_to_max_len worked well.

		hmm.. are you setting the padding also in the encoder or do you only want to have unified lengths of targets across batches?

		I want to have the targets up to a full sentence length. Because I treat them as sampled candidates, like the candidates that are sampled. They are sampled to full sentence length and I operate always on full length. So if a candidate is shorter than this, like most of the targets, I want to pad it.

		Hi,
Can I ask you for the configuration file you are using so I can check the problem? Thanks

		Hi,
