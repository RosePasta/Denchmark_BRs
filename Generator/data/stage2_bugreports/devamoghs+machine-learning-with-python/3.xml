	<summary>Unable to install requirements</summary>
	<description>
When installing the requirements I am met with a host of "Could not find a version..." errors. I have confirmed that I am indeed using Python 3.5 and followed your instructions on creating and activating a conda environment. See error below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Collecting anaconda-navigator==1.8.7 (from -r requirements.txt (line 7))
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement anaconda-navigator==1.8.7 (from -r requirements.txt (line 7)) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for anaconda-navigator==1.8.7 (from -r requirements.txt (line 7))
You are using pip version 10.0.1, however version 19.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 , I've pulled the updated code but unfortunately I still have the same issue. I have confirmed I'm using Python 3.5.6 and the conda virtualenv. See error below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Collecting Keras==2.2.4 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
  Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/5e/10/aa32dad071ce52b5502266b5c659451cfd6ffcbf14e6c8c4f16c0ff5aaab/Keras-2.2.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Collecting Keras-Application==1.0.6 (from -r requirements.txt (line 2))

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Try adding the conda-forge channel to your list of channels with this command: conda config --append channels conda-forge. It tells conda to also look on the conda-forge channel when you search for packages. You can then simply install the packages with conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
Channels are basically servers for people to host packages on and the community-driven conda-forge is usually a good place to start when packages are not available via the standard channels.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/devAmoghS&gt;@devAmoghS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, added conda-forge but some packages are still missing from the channels I have. See below:

		Use this command to install the missing packages
conda install -c conda-forge *list of packages separated by space*

		You can search the packages on this website as well.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/devAmoghS&gt;@devAmoghS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Seems the names in the requirements file were incorrect, at least for me. I've modified them and run the following and it now works:
conda install -c conda-forge ipython_genutils mkl_fft keras-applications pyyaml mkl_random
