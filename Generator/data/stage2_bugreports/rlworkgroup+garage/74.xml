	<summary>TF policies are broken</summary>
	<description>
Some of the policies in tf tree are broken due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/pull/58&gt;#58&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Many spaces are converted to gym.spaces but the policies are still checking if the action_space is rllab.tf.spaces.
E.g. rllab.tf.gaussian_mlp_policy.GaussianMLPPolicy

		Some polices in the tf tree is still using garage.tf.spaces, so I don't think this is totally fixed.
Also some policies are using space.flat_dim and they should be updated to flat_dim(space).
E.g. categorical_conv_policy
