		it's a matter of random seed -- if I set , it converges to 100 within 10 epochs. We can also let it run 15 epochs so it can converge with the default seed. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ryanjulian&gt;@ryanjulian&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 What do you think?

		If it's a matter of seed and itrs, please send a PR to update the seed an itrs used by the test. This is failing all of our builds every night, so we don't want to wait for a more stable implementation. The point of the test is to detect obvious regressions, it's sufficient to verify a (seed, itrs, performance) tuple.
