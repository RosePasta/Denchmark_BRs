	<summary>Move Sawyer environments and contrib.ros to a different repository</summary>
	<description>
The following Sawyer environments need to be updated to be compatible with their parent class SawyerEnv:

garage/envs/mujoco/sawyer/bin_sorting_env.py
garage/envs/mujoco/sawyer/block_stacking_env.py
garage/envs/mujoco/sawyer/reacher_env.py
garage/envs/mujoco/sawyer/sawyer_env.py

For example, now SawyerEnv requires an instance of the Configuration class as parameter for the start_goal_config, instead of the parameters initial_goal and intial_qpos.
Another more hidden issues need to be solved. For example, there seems to be an array size problem for BinSortingEnv when the method set_gripper_state in SawyerEnv gets called.
This issue also requires of tests to verify that the environments mentioned above can be instantiated and serialized (pickled).

		These aren't going to be stable for a release so let's just move them out. Reassigning to Keren and Utkarsh.
