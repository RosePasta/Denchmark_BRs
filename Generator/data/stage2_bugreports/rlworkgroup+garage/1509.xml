	<summary>log_std in agent info is wrong</summary>
	<description>
After the tfp patch, log_std in agent info is actually standard deviation, but not the logarithm of it.

		You're saying it's std, not log_std?

 Yes. Sorry I had a typo.

		agent_info is probably not needed as we move towards TFP?

 I agree. The only use case of agent info should be debugging. I am using it in TE to visualize embedding distribution.

		Before introducing TFP, agent_info basically represents a distribution and garage.distribution uses these dicts when calculating things like log likelihood. However, with TFP, agent_infos are no longer needed.
I think we will probably have it removed when we refactor policy API.
