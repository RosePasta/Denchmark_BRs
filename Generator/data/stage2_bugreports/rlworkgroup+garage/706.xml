	<summary>Nightly gym tests are failing</summary>
	<description>
This appears to be an out-of-memory bug related to MuJoCo viewer windows not closing. We probably need to update the custom code for closing environments

		Please prioritize this. A red build badge every day makes the project look bad.

 fixes the MjViewer windows not closing. However, I noticed that the windows for envs gym.envs.box2d, gym.envs.classic_control and gym.envs.atari don't close their windows either. Maybe i should manually close them too. What do you think?
Also how can i trigger nightly tests on CI manually?

		yes -- the regression might have spread to other gym suites. whenever you detect that the window closing is not working, please update the test suite to close them manually.
