	<summary>max_episode_length seems to break CEM/DQN cartpole example</summary>
	<description>
Hi again,
I've tried to run the CEM-Cartpole and DQN-Cartpole examples provided, but it seems that max_episode_length is an unexpected argument for both the CEM and the DQN. Removing max_episode_length allows them to run.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JustoA&gt;@JustoA&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
Thanks for reporting this. I couldn't reproduce this locally. I verified that  is an expected argument for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/master/src/garage/np/algos/cem.py#L46&gt;CEM&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/master/src/garage/tf/algos/dqn.py#L64&gt;DQN&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Are you running with the latest garage version? What's the error message?
Thanks.

		Perhaps &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JustoA&gt;@JustoA&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is running v2020.06 (from ), but running an example from master?
In that case, take a look at the examples from the release branch for the most recent release to PyPI (): &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/tree/release-2020.06/examples&gt;https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/tree/release-2020.06/examples&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		So sorry! Yes, I am running the example from master... I'll look at those examples instead! Sorry for the inconvenience!
