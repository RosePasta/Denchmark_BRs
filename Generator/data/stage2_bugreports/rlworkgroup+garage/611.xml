	<summary>LocalRunner closes tf sessions it does not own</summary>
	<description>
garage.experiment.local_tf_runner.LocalRunner will close its tf session in __exit__. However, the session may not have been created by LocalRunner and may be managed by some other entity. Closing externally-owned sessions can lead to unexpected behavior or failures.
Example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;with tf.Session() as sess:
  with LocalRunner(sess=sess) as runner:
    # Run an experiment
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Code will fail with error:
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__exit__'
