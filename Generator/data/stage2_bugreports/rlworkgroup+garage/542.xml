	<summary>Broken tests result in green CI</summary>
	<description>
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/102405158&gt;https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/102405158&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I suspect this has something to do with Docker and/or make

		The root cause is that the exit status when an command fails in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/master/scripts/travisci/check_tests.sh#L3&gt;check_tests.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is not passed to the parent process. This can be fixed by adding  to the script.

		Can you point me to before/after TravisCI links which show this fixes the problem?

		How can I re-run your build to see if it fails now that is merged? Since all the tests in nose2 are passing &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/102543187&gt;right now&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, should I introduce an error in the tests to make sure is detected?
: I pushed a branch to fail a test without considering my fix to see if it passes, and then I will rebase it on my fix to make sure if fails.

		Logs are here. For both, I failed the test  on purpose. The first one doesn't consider my fix and the CI still passes:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/102551165&gt;https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/102551165&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Second one considers my fix and fails the CI:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/102553337&gt;https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/102553337&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
