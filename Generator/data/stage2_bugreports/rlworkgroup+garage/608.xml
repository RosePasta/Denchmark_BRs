	<summary>Model class unit test flaw</summary>
	<description>
The tests for pickling models, e.g. GaussianMLPModel, do not test the weights pickling correctly. If pickle.dumps is called in another session, rather than the session the model is built, it will not be able to get the weights.
TODO: Fix the test and state clearly in the documentation.

		I don't think it would ever be possible (under TF&lt;2.0) to dump from outside the session the model was built in.

		How about a nested session? The tf.get_default_session() will still get the wrong session and hence it cannot get the variables from the correct scope.
