	<summary>*Conv* models should accept uint8(images) and normalize</summary>
	<description>
Convolution network should accept placeholder with type uint8 (images) but garage is not. Example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/master/src/garage/tf/policies/categorical_cnn_policy.py#L104&gt;https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/master/src/garage/tf/policies/categorical_cnn_policy.py#L104&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It should also normalize the images.

		Issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/issues/794&gt;#794&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/issues/795&gt;#795&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should cover this bug, since it makes more sense that sampler should be responsible to normalize the inputs if inputs are images. In that case, policies do not need to normalize the inputs and will receive normalized images, with type . Therefore closing this issue.

		Policies should be responsible to normalize pixel inputs. Reopened.
