	<summary>max_and_skip wrapper does not work with the ray sampler</summary>
	<description>
Related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/issues/1743&gt;#1743&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. When using the max_and_skip wrapper with an env and the ray_sampler, the private field of the wrapper  is not pickled properly. When ray workers go to write to this buffer, which is a numpy array, they get the error because  is now read only.
I don't believe that generally numpy arrays need to be pickled in special ways -- we do this all the time for policy weights. However, perhaps there is some special logic required to wrap environments that have an underlying numpy array inside of their wrappers.

		The root cause of this bug is that max_and_skip wrapper doesn't pickle properly, which is a requirement of most garage components.

		I think that this actually may have been an issue with improperly installed dependencies. I ran the example dqn_pong using docker off of master with RaySampler and I had no issues. I'm going to close this for now.
