	<summary>box2d_env.py with plot=True raises NotImplementedError</summary>
	<description>
Currently when running examples/trpo_cartpole.py with plot=True, the render() function in box2d_env.py raises a NotImplementedError on line 358.
However, commenting out both lines 357 and 358 will fix this issue and correctly draw the plot. This issue is being opened because the potential ramifications for commenting out these lines is unclear.
One potential reason for this new bug could be due to upgrading gym to v0.10, but unclear.
