	<summary>Possible Bug in garage/envs/base.py, unexpected attribute is_image</summary>
	<description>
I am using version 2020.4rc1
I follow more or lesse this tutorial &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/master/examples/tf/vpg_cartpole.py&gt;https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/master/examples/tf/vpg_cartpole.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I execute
environment = GarageEnv(env_name="CartPole-v1")  I get the following error:
TypeError: from_gym() got an unexpected keyword argument 'is_image'
I am not sure If I am doing something wrong or if this is an issue. When I track down the stacktrace
i get to the file /garage/envs/base.py and on line 62 I replace
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;self.observation_space = akro.from_gym(self.env.observation_space,
                                               is_image=is_image)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;self.observation_space = akro.from_gym(self.env.observation_space)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and this at least SEEMS to fix the issue, as the function from_gym has no attribute is_image. But I am not sure if it changes anything in the logic.

		Hi,
This error usually comes up when the version of akro you have is outdated. You can update akro using pip install akro -U from within your virtual/conda environment.
