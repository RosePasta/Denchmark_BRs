	<summary>No module named 'garage.logger'</summary>
	<description>
Helloï¼Œ
After installing garage and also cloning the repository, I opened up the "trpo_gym_tf_cartpole" Jupyter notebook from the example folder but when I execute the first cell, it gives an error that says: No module named 'garage.logger'. I am not sure why this is happening as the garage seemed to be installed correctly.
Thanks in advance!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jy-cds&gt;@jy-cds&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for trying garage! This appears to be a bug. The garage.logger modules were moved to the dowel pip package. You should be able to work around the problem by installing dowel and changing imports to dowel instead of garage.logger
