	<summary>GaussianMLPRegressor is not unpickled appropriately</summary>
	<description>
Sorry I can't come up with a good title for this but I will describe the problem in details here.
GaussianMLPRegressor has variables (e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/blob/f33a03ea4d71525eabadbe22f31ad0a91607b134/garage/tf/regressors/gaussian_mlp_regressor.py#L156&gt;y_mean&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) that are created for normalizing the inputs and they are not saved during pickling. This will force user to run a variable initialization when they want to use an unpickled GaussianMLPBaseline. However, running initialization will re-initialize the model variables.
This will affect people who want to use a pickled baseline object to resume training or use them to do further learning.

 is this fixed?

		I don't think this is fixed. GaussianMLPRegressor is not using garage model and I believe it is still using the same mechanism to serialize.

 will this be fixed if we use the model-based regressor?
