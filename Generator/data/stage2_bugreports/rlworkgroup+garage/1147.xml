 How can I reproduce the bug? I ran it locally on my machine, and it seems fine.

		You can run the tests several times on your machine manually and see if they fail. Make sure you use the docker container to run them. You will have to remove the flaky marker on the test definition (it skips the test).

		I used docker to run test_ppo_memorize_digits and test_trpo_cubecrash individually for about 10 times. I also ran the whole integration test script 5 times. I still cannot reproduce the bug. Can someone else try it out?
