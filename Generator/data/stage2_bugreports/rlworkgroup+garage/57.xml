	<summary>Fix mujoco env</summary>
	<description>
I found an issue in mujoco_env. The MjSim of mujoco_py does not has an attribute of geom_margin, which is used by _get_full_obs(). This is caused by a pr that refactors rllab.mujoco_py to mujoco_py
There might be other issues imported this pr. So a regression test of mujoco envs is desired for this issue.
