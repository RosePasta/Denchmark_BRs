	<summary>CI only running 19 tests</summary>
	<description>
My local suite runs 54 tests. Is something still guarded on the CI?

		Some CIs are running 19, others 54. Not sure yet what the source of the deviation is.

		I'm fairly certain it's because of this: ImportError: cannot import name 'MemmapingPool'.
This is probably why some tests aren't running, e.g. AttributeError: module 'tests.theano.algos' has no attribute 'test_algos'.

		That only occurs when you upgrade joblib to &gt;0.10, but the environment.yml on master is using joblib 0.10 and we have not committed Angel's change to upgrade.
Where did you see these errors?

		This was based on my observation that nose2 does not run test files that have import statement errors.

		 is still using joblib 0.10.3, but its builds are still only running 19 tests (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/82260970&gt;https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/builds/82260970&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It appears that the regression was introduced by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/pull/270&gt;#270&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 build before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/pull/270&gt;#270&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 build after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/pull/270&gt;#270&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Since you introduced the regression which wiped out &gt;50% of our test suite, can you please fix it ASAP?

		I suspect this might be because nose2 doesn't recognize test packages withoout __init__.py files, despite the fact that Python 3 was released a decade ago.
