3) Why we removed viskit? I cannot find it in garage.
Thanks！ I really like rllab and garage.

		Please file different issues for different problems. This isn't a conversation forum, after all, this is a tool for developing software. I have forked your second issue into &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/issues/698&gt;#698&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

viskit can be found at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/viskit&gt;https://github.com/rlworkgroup/viskit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or by installing using 
Can you please provide a specific launcher script which reproduces the problem you're describing (cannot plot during training)?

		I tried these scripts in garage/example/tf/: trpo_cartpole.py, trpo_gym_cartpole.py, vpg_cartpole.py.
I set
runner.train(n_epochs=100, batch_size=4000,plot=True)
and
run_experiment( run_task, snapshot_mode='last', seed=1, plot=True )
but all of these scripts cannot plot during training.

		I was able to confirm this bug.
For a hotfix, you can add self.plot = plot at the top of LocalRunner._train():
    def _train(self,
               n_epochs,
               n_epoch_cycles,
               batch_size,
               plot,
               store_paths,
               pause_for_plot,
               start_epoch=0):
        """Start actual training.

        Args:
            n_epochs(int): Number of epochs.
            n_epoch_cycles(int): Number of batches of samples in each epoch.
                This is only useful for off-policy algorithm.
                For on-policy algorithm this value should always be 1.
            batch_size(int): Number of steps in batch.
            plot(bool): Visualize policy by doing rollout after each epoch.
            store_paths(bool): Save paths in snapshot.
            pause_for_plot(bool): Pause for plot.
            start_epoch: (internal) The starting epoch.
                Use for experiment resuming.

        Returns:
            The average return in last epoch cycle.

        """
        assert self.has_setup, ('Use Runner.setup() to setup runner before '
                                'training.')

        # Save arguments for restore
        self.train_args = SimpleNamespace(
            n_epochs=n_epochs,
            n_epoch_cycles=n_epoch_cycles,
            batch_size=batch_size,

            pause_for_plot=pause_for_plot,
            start_epoch=start_epoch)

        self.plot = plot  # here
        self.start_worker()

 can you send in a fix?
