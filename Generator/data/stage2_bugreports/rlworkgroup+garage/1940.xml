@AiRuiChen do you have any idea about the root cause here?

Not from looking at the error message. Before I changed EnvSpec comparison logic, it compares the addresses of EnvSpec objects and only returns True if they matches. Could be the case here?

		I think these EnvSpecs are from gym and not garage, but I could be wrong. Perhaps your fix needs to be backported if they are garage EnvSpec.

		You are correct, the EnvSpecs are from gym. This test works fine before Environment related changes. If pinning gym version is the only difference, it could be a problem with the gym environment.
A quick fix might be , which compares the garage EnvSpec. Or simply remove the test. It is removed from master since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/commit/055b455ba18abcb8b7488a0b03da1fd8b8ab0216#diff-871176f53aa3d8337333571b8e2a8af5&gt;#1766 &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
