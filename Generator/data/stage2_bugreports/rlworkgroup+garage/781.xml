		For the  warning. This warning appears as long as tensorflow is imported in a test. There are other occurrences. for example, here &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/jobs/214866746#L1705&gt;https://travis-ci.com/rlworkgroup/garage/jobs/214866746#L1705&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
When a script is run from command line rather than pytest, these warnings are somehow magically suppressed. I did some investigation but didn't find out how and why.
For the  warning. This is fixed in tf 1.13. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/16152&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#16152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
To conclude, these warnings are rooted in tensorflow. Upgrading tensorflow may solve them. (But may also introduce other warnings!)
