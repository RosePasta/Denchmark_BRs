	<summary>deterministic.set_seed does not guarantee full determinism in TensorFlow</summary>
	<description>
Determinism in TensorFlow depends on two seeds: Graph seed and op seed. Currently deterministic.set_seed() only set the graph seed, which makes the random sequences generated by all ops be repeatable across sessions, but not when sequences of ops changed.
Setting both graph_seed and op_seed will guarantee full determinism, i.e. calling
&lt;denchmark-link:set_random_seed&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/set_random_seed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and applying a seed when calling any tf.ops (e.g. ).

 can you estimate how big a change we would need to fix this?

		Basically providing a seed to all tf.op -- shouldn't take long
