	<summary>Remove enclosing_scope and use tf.name_scope()</summary>
	<description>
The feature we attempted to implement with enclosing_scope() is properly implemented with the utility tf.name_scope(). Furthermore, enclosing_scope() is implemented with tf.variable_scope(), which can actually create unexpected side effects when defining neural networks (i.e. it makes every primitive and function call have its own set of variables, but in reality we often want shared variables).
