	<summary>local mlpack includes should have higher priority than system mlpack includes</summary>

The installation in /usr/local/include/ is being included before the mlpack source in /Users/chenzhe/mlpack_czdiao/.
Probably a CMake configuration change needs to happen to make this operate correctly.

		Looks as if by default, cmake appends the include_directories to the existing list of include directories, placing them after the system includes.
Setting &lt;denchmark-link:https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE.html#variable:CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE&gt;CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to ON will override this default behaviour.

		Thanks for pointing this out, I used that to assemble a fix and merged &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/commit/fd1cb71ccad275089057269eb426f896d5974655&gt;fd1cb71&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which appears to fix the issue.
