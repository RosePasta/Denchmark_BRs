Method: RSModel::BuildModel
Error:   .\src\mlpack\methods\range_search\rs_model.cpp(72): error C2899: typename can
not be used outside a template declaration
The fix, I think, would be to remove said keyword

		Hi there,
I don't have a setup to reproduce this.  If you'd like this fixed, could you please test that fix and provide a pull request?  Once you do that, I can test the fix on Linux (with gcc and clang) and then we can merge it in.
Thanks!

		I have implemented it and put it in my own fork &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/theSundayProgrammer/mlpack.git&gt;https://github.com/theSundayProgrammer/mlpack.git&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it works.
The change is simple: just remove the keyword 'typename' from rs_model.cpp.

		Yep, I merged in your commit.  Thanks!  Do you mind if I add your name/email to the list of contributors?
Also, it looks like your git configuration is a little off; your commits have the email '&lt;denchmark-link:mailto:joe.mariadassou@gmail.cvom&gt;joe.mariadassou@gmail.cvom&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
' (I amended this in each of the commits I cherry-picked from your fork to be 'gmail.com').

		I will honoured to be in the list of contributors.
II am not sure why github uses the wrong email address. My Profile is
correct.

		Sure, added in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/commit/4f97fdfb7e158025283c2652084af670bc6e2d76&gt;4f97fdf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Your Github profile is just fine -- I think the issue is with your git configuration on the system you are using to develop.
