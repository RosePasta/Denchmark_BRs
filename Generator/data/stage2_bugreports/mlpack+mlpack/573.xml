	<summary>AllkNNTest failing in 3 test cases</summary>
	<description>
I recently installed mlpack and tried running some test programs from source such as allknn_test.cpp by running mlpack_test -t AllkNNTest and this the output I got:
Running 21 test cases...
mlpack_test: /home/ozair/programming/mlpack/src/mlpack/../mlpack/core/tree/rectangle_tree/rectangle_tree_impl.hpp:882: bool mlpack::tree::RectangleTree&lt;MetricType, StatisticType, MatType, SplitType, DescentType&gt;::ShrinkBoundForPoint(const vec&amp;) [with MetricType = mlpack::metric::LMetric&lt;2, true&gt;; StatisticType = mlpack::neighbor::NeighborSearchStatmlpack::neighbor::NearestNeighborSort; MatType = arma::Mat; SplitType = mlpack::tree::RStarTreeSplit; DescentType = mlpack::tree::RStarTreeDescentHeuristic; arma::vec = arma::Col]: Assertion `false' failed.

*** 3 failures detected in test suite "mlpackTest"
It seems that the test is failing on three test cases:
KNNModelTest
KNNModelMonochromaticTest
NeighborPtrDeleteTest
It seems like there is assertion failure at line 882 when allocating a RectangleTree object. Also, in source file allknn_test.cpp, in BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(KNNModelMonochromaticTest), we are declaring an array of type KNNModel, at line 1052, while assigning a new kNNModel object at the highest index of the array, the code at the line references to models[0] instead of models[9], Hence, at the inner loop where the program is accessing the models array at i = 9, I think this will cause a memory exception because the object at this location was not assigned. But, I've yet to rebuild the program and test it out for myself yet.
Regards.

		Can you tell me more about the system you are running this on?  Is it some exotic hardware or something?  I haven't seen this problem anywhere.

		I cherry-picked a fix from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lozhnikov&gt;@lozhnikov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/commit/f77416e9ab5bb5d327805f7cb61bf206431ddfed&gt;f77416e&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/556&gt;#556&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  Basically, my changes to the R tree changing  to  was incorrect; I should have used  instead.  This causes failures, but only sometimes, which is why the Travis build didn't catch it and why I didn't see this before now.
