	<description>
MLPACK failed when build with /permissive- by msvc on Windows, I use latset version &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/commit/dabd108b38c8f58648c0b137dd60c8e9cf51f243&gt;dabd108&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on master branch. Could you please help look at this?
You can repro this issue as the steps below:

		Thanks for the report.  I don't have a Windows system set up, but I took a look at the error and I think I know what it is.
Can you try replacing  with the following file and let me know what happens?  &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.ratml.org/misc/CMakeLists.1593.txt&gt;http://www.ratml.org/misc/CMakeLists.1593.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks! üëç

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I verified the new CMakeLists and MLPACK compiled very well under /permissive- mode.

		Yes, I could use the workround. And I want to know if there is a plan to fix the source code? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
