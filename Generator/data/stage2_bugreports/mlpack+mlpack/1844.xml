 with &lt;denchmark-link:#&gt;http://www.mlpack.org/doc/*&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I think they are mentioned in the documentation on the new site that is for the old versions.  Probably I can just fix this with some regex on the Doxygen documentation for old versions.  I'll do that when I have a chance (so it will be a little while) unless someone beats me to it with the scripts on mlpack.org.  But I am not sure those are very easy to approach...

Replace http://www.mlpack.org/docs/* with http://www.mlpack.org/doc/*
I tried, but it still doesn't work. Actually, I found more expired URLs in Wiki, such as list of tutorials

		No need to close this yet, I still have one or two things to fix. üëç Working on it, but rebuilding the website is a bit slow.
