	<summary>mlpack_preprocess_split doesn't work when absolute paths are specified</summary>
	<description>
Here's what I tried to do to play with it:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ bin/mlpack_preprocess_split -i ~/datasets/corel.csv -I ~/datasets/corel.csv -t corel-train.csv -T corel-test.csv -v

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So I guess, we need to be more careful with prepending "train_", we have to do it in the right place.  Maybe some string tokenization is necessary. :(
Also, Keon, I made a few formatting and documentation changes in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/commit/6a94eb6efb37eca09e95fd53bd7c21334abf7614&gt;6a94eb6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, please let me know if I broke anything.
