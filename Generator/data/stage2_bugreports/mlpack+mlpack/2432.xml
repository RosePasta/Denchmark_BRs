	<summary>mlpack_krann has no tests</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The  binding, found in , doesn't have a corresponding test in .  This leads to errors like those that are fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2431&gt;#2431&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack: git master
operating system: debian
compiler: gcc 9
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo): shouldn't matter for this issue
any other environment information you think is relevant:

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Build tests, try to run bin/mlpack_test -t KRANNMainTest, see that it doesn't exist. :)
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

bin/mlpack_test -t KRANNMainTest should run some integration tests on the mlpack_krann binding.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ bin/mlpack_test -t KRANNMainTest
Test setup error: no test cases matching filter or all test cases were disabled
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;How to fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Basically, we just need to implement tests for the  binding.  There is a lot of information for how to do that in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1152&gt;#1152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		So sorry for being so late. I had some homework to submit. I think I have run into a problem, I wrote 11 tests for alpha, tau, dimensions and so on. I built the project, initially there were some errors, but I corrected them, now the test just runs indefinitely. I read some boost documentation but couldn't figure out where the problem was.&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/UtR491/mlpack/blob/krann-test/src/mlpack/tests/main_tests/krann_test.cpp&gt;The code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 no worries, there is no hurry. :)  Are you still having the problem?  If so, can you pinpoint which test is hanging?  You could run  with, e.g., .

 That problem is resolved now. Thanks!
I made a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2442&gt;#2442&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Should have mentioned the issue in it. My bad. But, I have run into another issue, there is a &lt;denchmark-link:http://ci.mlpack.org/job/pull-requests-mlpack-static-code-analysis/5077/cppcheck/&gt;build error&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for a file I did not even edit!! I have not seen it for a couple of days because I have been busy between college work and fixing some mistakes in other PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2427&gt;#2427&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		That's strange, maybe we have to whitelist that error in the static code analysis.  Don't worry about it; I saw that error once before for something else and whitelisting was the approach that we took there too. üëç
