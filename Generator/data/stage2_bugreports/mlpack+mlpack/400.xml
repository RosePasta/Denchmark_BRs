	<summary>Saving and Loading Submatrices</summary>
	<description>
Hi there,
there seems to be a problem when saving submatrices with the SaveRestoreUtility. When saving a normal object arma::mat obj, the elements are separated by commas. When saving something like obj.cols(0, 2), the elements are separated by pure whitespace. When loading such an object again into an arma::mat, only the first column of the data is loaded. The difference results from the specialisation for arma::mat matrices in the SaveRestoreUtility class. I don't know why this was implemented, as it works fine when the specialisation is just commented out (that's why I suggest that for solving the problem).

		Hi there,
Thanks for reporting this.  The code in SaveRestoreUtility is due for an overhaul (see also &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/315&gt;#315&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) at some point, but this helps make it a bit simpler.  Hopefully the commit in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/commit/abdfa0b989940f82b799d6afa1a3861afbf991e7&gt;abdfa0b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should help.
