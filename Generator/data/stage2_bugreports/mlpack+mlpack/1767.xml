	<summary>FastMKS (optdigits dataset) segmentation fault</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

mlpack_fastmks -r optdigits.csv -v  -k 10 -K hyptan returns with a segmentation fault.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack: git master and 3.0.4, maybe other version as well
operating system: FreeBSD, Linux (debian)
compiler: probably any gcc version or clang version
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo): doesn't matter

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run , you should see that it returns with a segmentation fault, &lt;denchmark-link:mlpack.org/datasets/optdigits.tar.gz&gt;optdigits&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 dataset. The run will only fail if the  kernel is used and if "-k" is set.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The executable should not fail with a segmentation fault. It should give a similar result as if run with: mlpack_fastmks -r optdigits.csv -v  -k 10 -K gaussian.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Here's some example output:
[INFO ] Loading 'optdigits.csv' as CSV data.  Size is 65 x 5620.
[INFO ] Loaded reference data (65 x 5620).
[INFO ] 5619 distance computations during tree construction.
zsh: segmentation fault  bin/mlpack_fastmks -r optdigits.csv -v -K hyptan --kernels_file kernels.csv -

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zoq&gt;@zoq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 when I was testing fastmks for cli bindings I couldn't pass  as . As It leads to tests running forever. But as you see in PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1765&gt;#1765&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 when I pass  from  in  It was passing tests correctly. Is this the correct solution for this issue?

 when we run  its returns with a segmentation fault.

		And  when we run bin/mlpack_fastmks -r optdigits.csv -v -k 10 -K hyptan -S with single-tree search it gives correct result and same with  --naive it gives correct result

Hi @zoq when we run bin/mlpack_fastmks -r optdigits.csv -v -k 0 -K gaussian its returns with a segmentation fault.

I see the same error, if I use k = 1 it does work. Can you reproduce the error with the command I posted above?

		Also, do you test against the mater branch or already against the changes you did in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1765&gt;#1765&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		I have tested this with both the master and branch which I have made and got the same error as from master.

		Thanks for the information, I wonder if this is dataset specific.

 I don't think that it is dataset specific because I tested this module with different datasets.

gaussian works correctly in every dataset and taking k as any value.
hyptan doesn't work correctly even taking k = 1

		Thanks for the additional insights, so if this isn't dataset specific, the issue might be in the kernel, I guess a first step could be to step through the code e.g. using gdb.

		I'm not able to run the command successfully; I suspect the datasets that are being used differ slightly.  I am using optdigits.csv from http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/optdigits.tar.gz and this produces the error in multiple different versions of mlpack that I checked.

		I locate the crash to the candidatesPoints.top() in FastMKSRules&lt;KernelType, TreeType&gt;::CalculateBound(TreeType&amp; queryNode) in fastmks_rules_imp.hpp to be empty.  So candidates vector in FastMKSRules object contains empty CandidateList. Any comment on why?

		I think you are right, and I can figure out why if I can reproduce the issue, but I can't reproduce it.  Can you share the dataset you are using that causes the issue?  (and also which version of mlpack you are using; you can get it with mlpack_fastmks --version)

		<comment id='17' author='zoq' date='2019-08-10T08:27:37Z'>
		I run the 3.1.1 mlpack
The dataset you given above &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/optdigits.tar.gz&gt;http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/optdigits.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The command I run is
mlpack_fastmks -r optdigits.csv -v -k 0  -K gaussian
I think k 0 parameter seems not right , why would user want 0 kernel? should it be return error immediately?
command mlpack_fastmks -r optdigits.csv -v -k 10 -K hyptan also crash , but at different point

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nttruong7&gt;@nttruong7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for the info.  I opened &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1986&gt;#1986&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with a fix for the issue. 
It's worth pointing out that I think we could make the command work on the optdigits dataset if the scale parameter (--scale) is chosen to be sufficiently small (maybe 0.001 or much smaller?  I am not sure).  Even so, it did highlight an issue that warrants fixing.

		Since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1986&gt;#1986&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is merged, I think we can close this issue now.
