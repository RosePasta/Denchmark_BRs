	<summary>-lrt is not needed on OpenBSD either</summary>
	<description>
Seems to me someone should really write a test for the location of clock_gettime().
Or maybe just reverse the test.
Because NetBSD and FreeBSD have clock_gettime as part of libc either. They won't error out because they have a stub -lrt.
AFAIK, only Linux requires -lrt to get clock_gettime...

		Thanks for the input!
Where are you seeing that -lrt is being used?  As far as I know we're not explicitly linking against it.  Also the timers use stuff from chrono, not clock_gettime() (unless chrono internally uses clock_gettime(), but that shouldn't make a huge difference in our case anyway).
Are you by chance using a really old version of mlpack (like mlpack 1.x or 2.x)?  I seem to remember those explicitly linking against -lrt in places.

On libmlpack itself,  version 3.0.3

see the main CMakeLists.txt. Line 155 or so.

# For clock_gettime().
if (UNIX AND NOT APPLE AND NOT HAIKU)
  set(MLPACK_LIBRARIES ${MLPACK_LIBRARIES} "rt")
endif ()

		Oh, you're right, there it is.  Seems like my grepping around didn't find it.  I think we can just remove that block entirely since clock_gettime() isn't used anymore, so I'll do that.  üëç

		Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1523&gt;#1523&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks again for the report
