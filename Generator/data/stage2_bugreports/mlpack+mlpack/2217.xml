		Hey, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/niranjanrao1509&gt;@niranjanrao1509&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 did you try running any program/code yourself?
You can look here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.2.2/doxygen/namespacemlpack_1_1rl.html&gt;Reinforcement Learning Documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for various methods and policies.
You can also look at various tests implemented like: ,  and  to better understand how the RL library is used.
But yeah, I don't think there's a proper tutorial.
