	<summary>Runtime of each epoch increases with increasing the maxEpochs / totalEpochs</summary>
	<description>
I was running a basic FFN network and realized that as I increased the number of maxEpochs, the run time of each epoch (not speaking about the total time for training) . I wanted to ask whether there is any specific reason for the same and whether this issue can be tackled?

		Some optimizer (e.g. BigBatchSGD) use a dynamic batch size, so so time between epochs could increase. Do you think you could provide a simple model to reproduce the issue?
