	<summary>Logistic Regression Test Fails on Azure.</summary>
	<description>
The Logistic Regression Test fails on azure for most PRs that made a commit today. Here is the link to one of &lt;denchmark-link:https://dev.azure.com/mlpack/mlpack/_build/results?buildId=1429&amp;view=logs&amp;j=1b38ea94-fede-5667-20eb-44d3de1ec085&amp;t=72087b03-c17c-5a26-b713-236d9bb6c096&amp;l=149&gt;them&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Locally they run fine alteast on my machine. This might be a good first issue to get started with testing. This issue is open for taking up. Let me know if you need any help. Thanks a ton.

		Interesting, it passed the build in that PR though.  I'll try to investigate tonight.  Does it happen on every PR or only sometimes?

		I've been looking into this over the weekend.  It's not at all straightforward.  But I'm able to reproduce it, though only on an OS X system.  In short, for some reason, an Armadillo expression that is vector * sparse_matrix gets interpreted as diagmat(vector) * sparse_matrix, which leads to incorrect results.  That only seems to happen on OS X, and only with Armadillo 9.860.1.  So, I haven't gotten to the bottom of it quite yet, I'm still digging...  I'm interested to see what the issue is when I finally do get there. :)

		I guess this happens to many of those , IG my brnn callback pr would fail in osx for similar reasons

		Right, all of the OS X builds will currently fail with this error. üëç

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 It's a bug in Armadillo 9.860.1.  Fixed in 9.860.2.  The bug is not present in earlier versions (eg. 9.850.x, 9.800.x, etc). MacPorts has already updated its Armadillo &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&amp;substr=armadillo&gt;package&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Homebrew &lt;denchmark-link:https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/armadillo&gt;package&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 still at 9.860.1 - someone may need to politely prod the maintainers.

 beat me to it. :)  I had mostly stepped through the code to figure out what is going on, but I never got to the point of understanding why 9.860.1 didn't fail in the same way on OS X.  (Not sure if it's a clang issue or what, hadn't gotten that far.)
I see you literally just opened &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/53139&gt;Homebrew/homebrew-core#53139&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
; once that's merged, our builds should be fixed and then we can close this issue.
Thanks! üíØ

		I don't think so we should close this soon , let it sit there until that pr is merged so that if some else faces the issue , they can know what's the reason

		Great work &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/conradsnicta&gt;@conradsnicta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but still it's failing in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2370&gt;#2370&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jeffin143&gt;@jeffin143&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 PR is merged.

 we're probably just a bit too fast---from the build log:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;==&gt; Pouring armadillo-9.860.1.mojave.bottle.tar.gz
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

so I guess it's still using the old version.  We can try again tomorrow :)
