	<summary>BinarySpaceTree does not take instantiated metrics</summary>
	<description>
Reported by rcurtin on 25 Mar 42697459 04:49 UTC
If you want to use a tree with an interesting metric that holds data (such as the Mahalanobis distance), currently you can't because BinarySpaceTree only works with metrics that have static Evaluate() functions.
This also will require a refactoring of HRectBound to accept instantiated metrics.
A quick test should be done to see if a serious runtime penalty is caused by this.  Realistically the metric should be held internally as a reference.

Blah, so it turns out for the application I'm working on, the better solution is actually to stretch the dataset beforehand instead of using a Mahalanobis distance, so this is still something that should be done, but I'm not going to need to do it for now.

		Closing this, because the BinarySpaceTree does not support metrics that aren't the LMetric---which has no need to be instantiated.
