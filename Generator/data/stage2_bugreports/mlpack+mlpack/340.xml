	<summary>hmm_convert fails for GMM HMM</summary>
	<description>
Reported by michaelfox99 on 20 Feb 44607272 02:27 UTC
HMMs are now stored in XML files as hierarchical models. This allows saving / loading of HMMs with arbitrary emission distributions as long as the distributions themselves implement Save() and Load() methods.
The new XML files for the HMMs are not backwards compatible. Towards this end I added hmm_convert, an executable converter. While this works correctly for DiscreteDistribution and GaussianDistribution types, it is failing for GMM at runtime.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;michael@michael-GA-78LMT-USB3:~/Documents$ hmm_convert -m old_model_1.xml -o model1.xml
[DEBUG] Compiled with debugging symbols.
*** Error in `hmm_convert': free(): invalid pointer: 0x00007feef54d7dc8 ***
Aborted (core dumped)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

old_model_1.xml is a GMM HMM using the old flat format. This is despite GMM::Save() and GMM::Load() working just fine and hmm_convert being generic with respect to those calls. There are no explicit calls to free, so I suspect its happening in libxml2.

		I'm going to close this for inactivity because the hmm_convert and gmm_convert programs have been removed now (maybe this will have to be reopened if someone complains about those utilities being gone...).
