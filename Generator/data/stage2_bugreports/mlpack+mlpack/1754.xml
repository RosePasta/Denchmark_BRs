		I think that mlpack works only with numeric matrices.so instaed of having text map it with some numeric value.

 but consider that the categorical features are two words long. Then mlpack would just map the first word. So after prediction unmapping, the categorical label would go incorrect.

		if mlpack is mapping based on only first word then it will go wrong but
first you have to see how that method is implemented.
I agree

		besides normal comma parsing, it also looks for patterns like "string", 'string', "text with ,coma".

		I think based on user analysis it will be decided which word should be taken
