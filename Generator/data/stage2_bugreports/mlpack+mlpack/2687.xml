I have never seen this error before... are you sure something is not wrong with the system you are using?

Everything else seems to be fine.

		I really truly can't find any information about that particular error.  There is a suggestion somewhere that the machine might not have enough available RAM.  Past that, I really don't think I have any idea how to start debugging this one. :(  Maybe someone else has some ideas?

		Let me build mlpack on my FreeBSD system.

		I encountered this problem after updating the FreeBSD port /usr/ports/math/mlpack to 3.4.2 and then running make test there.

		So a previous version was already installed?

No.

		On FreeBSD this can be reproduced with

cd /usr/ports/math/mlpack
change the version in Makefile to 3.4.2
make makesum test

		So what do I do about these failures?

		None of us have been able to reproduce these issues, and they have never been seen on any other platform or by any other user.  I have some belief that this is specific to your setup.  If I were you I might check the exact commands being used for build with VERBOSE=1 make, and make sure that these are actually what you expect on your system.  Sorry I can't provide any better support.
