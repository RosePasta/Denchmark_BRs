	<summary>Python bindings setup assumes too many things</summary>
	<description>
Around line 40 of setup.py.in:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;              # CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS seems to have an extra space.
              extra_compile_args=('-DBINDING_TYPE=BINDING_TYPE_PYX ' + \
                  '-std=c++11${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}').split(' '),
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

nope, it doesn't. Not always.  Funny seeing my compiler trying to build with
-std=c++11-O2
and right after that:
extra_link_args=['${OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS}'],
turns into a magnificent NOT FOUND while building extensions. I have no idea (yet) whether OpenMP is required for python bindings, or whether a specific build configuration accidentally has it.
If it's required, the main CMakeLists.txt logic should then proceed to disable python extensions...

		I can confirm that the python bindings build just fine without ${OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS} on a !OpenMP installation...

		Ah, thanks.  I think that the two issues you've encountered here are related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1478&gt;#1478&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1425&gt;#1425&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, respectively.  In both of those cases, it was problematic to come up with fixes because we couldn't directly reproduce them.
Can you try the patch in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1478&gt;#1478&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and see if that works for you?  If so, then I'd be happy to commit that.
And for the OpenMP CXXFLAGS bit, I bet this is what was going wrong in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1425&gt;#1425&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so thanks for pointing it out.  We can probably do the following... in , change the block at line 360 from:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if (OPENMP_FOUND)
  add_definitions(-DHAS_OPENMP)
  set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_C_FLAGS}")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS}")
else ()
  # Disable warnings for all the unknown OpenMP pragmas.
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wno-unknown-pragmas")
endif ()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

to
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if (OPENMP_FOUND)
  add_definitions(-DHAS_OPENMP)
  set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_C_FLAGS}")
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS}")
else ()
  # Disable warnings for all the unknown OpenMP pragmas.
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wno-unknown-pragmas")
  set(OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS "")
endif ()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If that works, I'll open a PR with these two fixes and also the ones from the other issues you've opened.  Thanks again for the reports, these are all great things to get fixed. üëç
