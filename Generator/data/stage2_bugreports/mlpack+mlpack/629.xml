	<summary>Intel MKL issues with linear_regression &amp; lars</summary>
	<description>
I had to disable MKL and recompile armadillo and mlpack to get around an mkl issue, which did solve the following problem.
Heres the debug info for a linear regression run
$&gt; ~/mlpack/usr/local/bin/mlpack_linear_regression -t /tmp/n20train.csv -r /tmp/ny1.csv -T /tmp/n20test.csv -p /tmp/nyout1.csv -v
[INFO ] Loading '/tmp/n20train.csv' as CSV data. Size is 30 x 20000.
[INFO ] Loading '/tmp/ny1.csv' as raw ASCII formatted data. Size is 1 x 20000.
Intel MKL ERROR: Parameter 4 was incorrect on entry to DGELSD.
[INFO ] Loading '/tmp/n20test.csv' as CSV data. Size is 30 x 20000.
[FATAL] The model was trained on 18446744073709551615-dimensional data, but the test points in '/tmp/n20test.csv' are 30-dimensional!

		What versions of Armadillo, MKL, mlpack, and gcc are you using, and on what platform?  I don't have a copy of MKL at the moment, so I can't reproduce, but if you can provide all the versioning information, that will make reproducing this issue easier.  Thanks!

		There was never any chance to look into this one.  I'm sorry about that.  If you are still having the issue with updated sources, let me know and I will reopen the issue and be sure to look into it on a quicker timescale.
