I looked in otrav.h to discover possibly the scariest thing I've seen in years.  I think I may mail a letter to Sonny Perdue to get this kind of stuff legally outlawed.
Currently the object traversal system is written entirely in #define macros.  I was trying to figure out why and this wonderful list of svn commits was presented to me:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://trac.research.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/log/fastlib/base/otrav.h?rev=912&gt;http://trac.research.cc.gatech.edu/fastlab/log/fastlib/base/otrav.h?rev=912&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(14 of Garry's 22 commit messages read "hi")
The system clearly fills a niche, allowing an easy way to do object traversal of your classes.  But there has to be a better way.  Doing it with #define macros is a crime against humanity.
This will require a lot of thought.  Maybe a job for the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (&lt;denchmark-link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)?
