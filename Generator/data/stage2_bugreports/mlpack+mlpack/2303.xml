	<summary>Padding in Pooling Layers</summary>
	<description>
Pytorch has the support for adding padding in pooling layers (&lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#maxpool2d&gt;https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#maxpool2d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Going through the codebase I saw that mlpack does not have support for it.
I would like to work on this unless it has not been added by choice. I would add default values so existing codes not break.
I would open a PR if this sounds good.
