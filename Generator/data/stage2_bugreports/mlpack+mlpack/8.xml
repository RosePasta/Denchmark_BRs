	<summary>Remove dead branches and cruft from svn</summary>
	<description>

I notice 'fastlib', 'fastlib2', 'fastlib3', 'fastlib-cmake' in the svn tree but only 'fastlib2' has been touched recently.  'fastlib-cmake' was never reintegrated into the project.  The status of that needs to be fixed.
We should also move to the standard 'trunk/ branches/ tags/' format of svn repositories, because that is standard.  If anything the dead fastlib branches should be moved into branches/ with a more accurate description of why they were branched (if there was an actual reason, if there is not, it should be removed entirely).  'fastlib-cmake' should be moved into 'branches/', but it has its own svn tree beneath it (???) which should be removed.  Alternately, a 'trunk/ branches/ tags/' tree could be created beneath the 'fastlib/' directory, which is what has been done for 'mathProg' (which by the way is being correctly used, as far as svn standards go).
There is also a good amount of cruft beneath the papers/ directory -- for example, compilation artifacts that are not necessary, such as any .aux files.  I don't know if removing that is even worth the effort.
Inside of the 'fastlib/' directory, the 'bin/', 'bin_keep/', 'lib/', and 'include/' directories are unnecessary.  They should be generated and populated at build-time, not stored in the svn repository.  On top of that those directories (and any other build artifacts) should be added to the svn:ignore property, so 'svn status' doesn't display all that after building.
