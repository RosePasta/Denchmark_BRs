	<summary>Hard Shrink Activation Function does not comply to new method signatures</summary>
	<description>
The hard shrink activation function was added in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2186&gt;#2186&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 before method signatures were changed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2259&gt;#2259&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Since it was merged before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2259&gt;#2259&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was merged, it still has the old method signatures.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/favre49&gt;@favre49&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I was going to open a pr for the same today but it is okay with me if &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kartikdutt18&gt;@kartikdutt18&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is doing other functions also.
Thanks.
