	<summary>Cannot build mlpack from source after distro upgrade.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I recently updated to Ubuntu 19.04 and when I tried to recompile mlpack from source I started getting this weird error .
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack: master branch
operating system: Ubuntu 19.04
compiler: g++ 8.30
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo): 1.67 / ARMA version: 9.200.7
any other environment information you think is relevant: It used to work in previous version without any issues .

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

$ mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
$ sudo cmake -D PROFILE=ON -D BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -BUILD_TESTS=ON -D FORCE_CXX11=ON -D USE_OPENMP=ON -D TEST_VERBOSE=ON -D MATHJAX_JS_PATH=/home/niteya/MathJax/ -D MATHJAX=ON  ../mlpack
$ make install
(build is outside of mlpack folder)
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The Library should be installed .
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have checked and the boost include is there in /usr/include/boost , so I dont know why the compiler cant find the header files. I also tried to manually add them via BOOST_INCLUDEDIR in cmake but still the error persisted.

		I wrongly wrote the cmake command and changing it fixed the issue :)

		Hi, I got the same error. Could you please provide which part was wrong?

 can you post the commands you used to build mlpack, the  file might be interesting as well.

		Hi zoq, I think I was using a normal command:
cmake -D DEBUG=ON -D PROFILE=ON -D USE_OPENMP=ON  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/mlpack  ../
FindBoost showed that it could find the boost:
Found Boost 1.70.0 at /home/louis/boost/lib/cmake/Boost-1.70.0
--   Requested configuration: QUIET REQUIRED COMPONENTS
program_options;unit_test_framework;serialization

-- Found Boost components:
program_options;unit_test_framework;serialization
I checked the CMakeList.txt file. But it cannot set the Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS, Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS, Boost_LIBRARIES. These variables are empty.
I was doubting if I installed the boost correctly until I saw this post.

		Hi all, I think I have solved it. Just a hint for others how I solved it: According to &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56036266/boost-libraries-not-defined&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56036266/boost-libraries-not-defined&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the information showed above means FINDBOOST can't locate where the boost is. So the problem becomes easy. just guide your CMakeLists.txt to find the path of boost. What I do is to put list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/path/of/boost/") in CMake file. Thank you for your attention.
