	<summary>non-configurable install directory locations</summary>
	<description>
I still have a patch in OpenBSD because we install our man pages straight under /usr/local/man and not /usr/local/share/man
Actually, there's a module in cmake that ought to take care of that:
 include(GNUInstallDirs)
but this is likely to affect a bit more than just manpages...
Please consider it.

		üëç I can work up a patch for that.  I think I have meant to use GNUInstallDirs for some time now.
