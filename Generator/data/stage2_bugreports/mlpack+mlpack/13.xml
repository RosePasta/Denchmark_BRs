	<summary>Reorganize namespaces</summary>

The current use of namespaces is a little shaky and doesn't make all that much sense to people new to the code.  Let's aim for something more like...
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;fastlib {
  fastlib::col
  fastlib::data (or fastlib::file?  merge these two)
  fastlib::fx
  fastlib::linalg
  fastlib::math
  fastlib::mlpack
  fastlib::par
  fastlib::thor
  fastlib::tree
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I may have missed some components there but the general idea is that the namespace names should be descriptive enough to explain what that component is while not being a nuisance to type, and we should try to restrict the number of namespaces we use (hence the merge of ::file and ::data, since they seem to be related).
Everything should fall under the '''fastlib''' namespace.
