	<summary>`BRNNReberGrammarTest` fails more than 50% of the time</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1626&gt;#1626&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was merged, the Jenkins builds are marked as unstable for different builds:
&lt;denchmark-link:http://ci.mlpack.org/job/docker%20mlpack%20nightly%20build/&gt;http://ci.mlpack.org/job/docker%20mlpack%20nightly%20build/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

All of these failures are BRNNReberGrammarTest.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack: git master
operating system: Linux (debian)
compiler: any gcc version or clang version
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo): doesn't matter
any other environment information you think is relevant: see http://ci.mlpack.org/job/docker%20mlpack%20nightly%20build/

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Add mlpack::math::RandomSeed(std::time(NULL)) to the top of BRNNReberGrammarTest in src/mlpack/tests/recurrent_network_test.cpp.  This step is important because otherwise the test will always run with the same random seed.  Compile and run (potentially in a loop like this):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ i=0; while(true); do echo $i; bin/mlpack_test -t RecurrentNetworkTest/BRNNReberGrammarTest 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'fatal error'; i=$(($i + 1)); sleep 1; done
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

You can see that it fails more than half the time.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The test should not fail.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Here's some example output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ bin/mlpack_test -t RecurrentNetworkTest/BRNNReberGrammarTest
Running 1 test case...
/home/ryan/src/mlpack/src/mlpack/tests/recurrent_network_test.cpp(648): fatal error: in "RecurrentNetworkTest/BRNNReberGrammarTest": critical check successes &gt;= 1 has failed [0 &lt; 1]

*** 1 failure is detected in the test module "mlpackTest"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I can see also that the test is only running 1 iteration, which could be part of the problem.

 can you please look into this?  If we can't get this solved then we should remove the BRNN code since it is not stable.  Thanks!

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , this is unexpected. I am busy with my exams right now and will try to investigate the problem in the next few days. Sorry about the delay.

		No problem; I may find a workaround but it warrants further investigation.

		I was able to reproduce the failure after adding the random seed.

		There was a small mistake in the code. I will open a PR.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ i=0; while(true); do echo $i; bin/mlpack_test -t RecurrentNetworkTest/BRNNReberGrammarTest 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'fatal error'; i=$(($i + 1)); sleep 1; done
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I also tested running this for 50 iterations (with the random seed) without producing any failures.
