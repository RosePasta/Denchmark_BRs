fl-build needs to go.  Unwieldy, large dependency that nobody's maintaining.
cmake is actually not a build system but a Makefile generator (slightly more complex than that).  It can be tuned to output Visual Studio projects or standard GNU Makefiles or all sorts of other random stuff like that.  It was chosen for its portability, since autotools tends to be geared much more towards Linux than anything else (autotools is also like shooting yourself in the face with a knife).
Leif did work on this in what is currently the /fastlib-cmake/ svn directory, but it was never re-integrated into the main build system.  It needs to be

polished
checked on several different system configurations
reintegrated into the trunk
introduced to the general FASTLAB public
