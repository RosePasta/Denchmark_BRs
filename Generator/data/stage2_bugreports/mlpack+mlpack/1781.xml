&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Problem location&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

src/mlpack/core/data/map_policies/increment_policy.hpp
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description of problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In multiline comment at line 25, instead of  " one if the "  it should be " one of the ". At a very first
look it just confuses the reader regarding the IncrementPolicy helper class.

		Since this is included in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1779&gt;#1779&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and we have an issue open in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1778&gt;#1778&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there's no need to keep this open.

		ShikharJ sir can you please elaborate more why you closed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1781&gt;#1781&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I didn't understand the above reason as I am not an active github user

		The above reason has nothing to do with being an active GitHub user :) There is already a documentation based issue opened by you, and it is redundant to open individual issues for single line documentation errors. Additionally, you did end up including this in the PR, so no reason to keep it open.
