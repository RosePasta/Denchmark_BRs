&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I install mlpack, then try to import the emst function, I get an error:

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BoltonBailey&gt;@BoltonBailey&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for the report.  It looks like for some reason PyPI OS X builds don't actually include the mlpack libraries!  I will work on trying to figure out why that is.  In the meantime, if you want, you could download mlpack and build the Python bindings from source (just set  during the CMake configuration step, then  and ... I think that will work).  Let me know if I can clarify anything about that, and I'll post an update here when I work out the issue.

		Doing what you suggested, I got an error when I ran cmake, telling me it could not build R bindings. I don't have R installed on my system.

		Ok, I installed Ensmallen and ran it again, and this time it worked. I was able to make mlpack and import correctly. Thank you for your help and I appreciate your looking into the PyPI problem.

		Another report on this, after downloading mlpack using these instructions and running emst(), I got a segmentation fault. Should I open a new ticket for this?

		Oh, that's unfortunate, sorry that happened. :( This issue is fine, can you paste the command and output here?  Also, is it possible there are multiple versions of mlpack installed on your machine?

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BoltonBailey&gt;@BoltonBailey&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I think I've fixed this on PyPI... I was able to run the following locally on an OS X system:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ pip install mlpack
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import mlpack
&gt;&gt;&gt; from mlpack import pca
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.random.rand(10, 10)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; pca(x, new_dimensionality=5, verbose=True)
...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And that all seemed to work, indicating to me that the dependent libraries are now being included.  Can you give that a shot and let me know if that works for you too?

		I can confirm that I can import the emst function and run it on a 10 by 10 random array, so the import and library problem is resolved.
Running it on my 117956 by 3 array, I get a segmentation fault. Not sure what's causing this, its actually mystifying because it runs perfectly fine on a random array of the same size and dtype as my data, it just seems to fail on my data specifically. I'll try to resolve this myself, and if I think something else is wrong I'll open another ticket. Thanks so much for your help &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		That's strange... can you reproduce the issue with the command-line programs?  I can try too if you can supply the dataset.  (Are there duplicate points in your dataset?  Try filtering them?  If that is the issue I think we need to figure out better error output! üòÑ)
Anyway, glad that it worked!  And thank you again for reporting it---I had no idea it was an issue. üëç

		I just found that my data had some inf and nan values in it, it seems this was causing the segfault. Totally my fault. Removing those data points, it works perfectly, start to finish. I guess its up to mlpack maintainers if they want to do some kind of sanitization before these algorithms run, but it would have been helpful for me. Thanks again.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BoltonBailey&gt;@BoltonBailey&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 good point.  This is something I've thought about for a while but have never actually moved on.  I wrote up an idea in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/2679&gt;#2679&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
; hopefully we'll get it implemented at some point in the future and that should make these types of errors easier to spot.
