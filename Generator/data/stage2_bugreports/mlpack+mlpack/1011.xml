	<summary>PVS-Studio static code analyzer results</summary>
	<description>
The following is the output of the PVS-Studio static code analyzer, I think we can probably ignore most of the warnings like Not all members of a class are initialized inside the constructor., but there are some warnings that might be interesting. I've also tested clang's static code analyzer, no remarks at all.


mlpack/core/util/cli.hpp  173 warn  V690

		Nice results, I have always wondered what a static analyzer would dig up. I'll try to take a look at the individual issues this week.

		I think one of the more interesting issues are:


mlpack/core/tree/rectangle_tree/rectangle_tree_impl.hpp 971 warn  V519
The 'stillShrinking' variable is assigned values twice successively. Perhaps this is a mistake. Check lines: 962, 971.

I wonder why clang missed something like that:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;// Copy the children.
left = ((obj.left == NULL) ? NULL : new DTree(*obj.left));
left = ((obj.right == NULL) ? NULL : new DTree(*obj.right));
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zoq&gt;@zoq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can I take this up and fix the issues highlighted in your second comment?
The open PR hasn't been worked on for a while.

		I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is more than happy to share the work, let's see what he likes to do here.

		<comment id='5' author='zoq' date='2018-02-25T15:55:18Z'>
		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sayan98&gt;@Sayan98&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, please feel free to use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1022&gt;#1022&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as a starting point. I ran out of time and was not able to fully address that one. In many cases it involved implementing copy/move constructors and operators for a lot of classes, so I think there are still a few places where that needs to be done.

		This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.  It will be closed in 7 days if no further activity occurs.  Thank you for your contributions! 👍
