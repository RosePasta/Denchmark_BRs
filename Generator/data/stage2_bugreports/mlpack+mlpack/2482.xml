	<summary>Go bindings bug: returning pointer to a local variable</summary>
	<description>
I was fixing build warnings and I've found an issue.
src/mlpack/bindings/go/mlpack/capi/cli_util.cpp:125
const char* mlpackGetParamString(const char* identifier)
{
  std::string val = CLI::GetParam&lt;std::string&gt;(identifier);

  // The pointer will be freed after return!
  return val.c_str();;
}
It's definitely an error. I'm not sure how to fix. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with go.

		Nice catch!  I think it could suffice here to literally just do .  In that situation,  will return a , which would not be freed as soon as the function returned.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Yashwants19&gt;@Yashwants19&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 let me know what you think.
