	<summary>Use profiling information during compilation</summary>

This should be a relatively simple task to set up (once the blocking bugs are resolved).
Using the testing framework set up in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/18&gt;#18&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, tell the compiler to use profiling information to optimize FASTLIB.
We should see some speed gains from this.
