		Can you tell me what version of CMake you are using, and can you also try with the newer mlpack 2.2.3?  &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.mlpack.org/files/mlpack-2.2.3.tar.gz&gt;http://www.mlpack.org/files/mlpack-2.2.3.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Are you able to try using CMake 3?  And can you verify that the error persists if you first do make then make install as two separate commands?

		Hmm, interesting, glad that a new CMake solved the issue.  I will leave this issue open though, in case anyone who is looking for a way to contribute wants to figure this out.  I'm happy to merge a patch and release 2.2.4 with a fix, for anyone who is still using CMake 2.8.  Otherwise, the code causing the issue won't exist in mlpack 3.0.0, so this can be closed when that is released.

		I had this issue when I was using cmake version 2.8.12.2. I then updated it to 3.8.2. Even then, I was having this issue. I was using was C++98. When I updated it to C++ 11, it was resolved. Hence, the solution looks like using CMake version &gt;=3 and g++ version &gt;=5.

 Feel free to work on the issue, the first step is to reproduce the error, let us know if we should clarify anything.

		Since mlpack 3 is now released, I think it is ok to close this issue.  The code that was causing the problem is no longer in the repository.
