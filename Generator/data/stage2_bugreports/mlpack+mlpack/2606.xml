&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

this is the error showing when I am building mlpack in my system.
$ wget &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/files/mlpack-3.4.0.tar.gz&gt;https://www.mlpack.org/files/mlpack-3.4.0.tar.gz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

$ tar -xvzpf mlpack-3.4.0.tar.gz
$ mkdir mlpack-3.4.0/build &amp;&amp; cd mlpack-3.4.0/build
$ cmake ../
$ make -j4  # The -j is the number of cores you want to use for a build.
$ sudo make install
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack:3.4.0
operating system:ubuntu 18.04
compiler:tilix
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo):Armadillo
any other environment information you think is relevant:

		i have done same as directed in this page
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-git/doxygen/build.html#build_dep&gt;https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-git/doxygen/build.html#build_dep&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


after your suggestion I have installed boost unit test framework but it is
showing a lot more files that are not found what about that.

		As long as you don't want to build the R, Julia or Go bindings you can ignore the warnings.

		I faced the same issue even after installing boost, but just removing the "build" directory that I had made and then redoing cmake ../ after creating a new "build" directory solved the problem.
So in short just run the following commands in the mlpack dir after installing all the necessary dependencies:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;rm -r build
mkdir build
cd build &amp;&amp; cmake../
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
