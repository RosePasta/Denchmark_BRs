	<summary>Dataset used in Python Get Started example is not available at mlpack.org</summary>
	<description>
The quick start guide offers a Random Forest example in Python here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.0/doxygen/python_quickstart.html&gt;https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.0/doxygen/python_quickstart.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Which refers to the dataset:
df = pd.read_csv('http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/covertype-small.csv.gz')
But this dataset file is not available in the web server: "The requested URL was not found on this server"

		I get a 301, but my version of pandas seems to have no problem with it.

		Right, I just took a look and the file appears to be there:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/datasets/&gt;https://www.mlpack.org/datasets/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gmanlan&gt;@gmanlan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 maybe the 301 redirect to HTTPS is causing a problem on your system or something?  Do you have any additional output from when you tried?
(Also, maybe it is possible that you got extremely unlucky and happened to access the website right when a rebuild was being deployed?  That seems really unlikely though.)

		Wow, that's extremely weird. I can assure that I was getting 404, tried like 10 times yesterday from Databricks and from the browser. Now it's working.... maybe a deployment or proxy issue?
Anyway, thanks for checking! We can move on.

		Huh, that is strange; but I can't think of what the issue would have been.  The website only rebuilds every night at midnight UTC (8pm EST, 5pm PST), and even then it just drops the new website in place so any 404s or issues should be basically instantaneously fixed.

, How much time is required for a build to finish? When this issue has been posted I tried 20 minutes later and I got also 404. I thought some maintenance was happening. I found it strange that a build takes as long as 20 minutes.

		Wow, sorry to fail to respond to this one for so long.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shrit&gt;@shrit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it can take a decent amount of time for the website to build, because we actually have to build mlpack's Doxygen documentation, which can take a little while.  However the scripts that run the build drop the new website in place all in one command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;jekyll clean &amp;&amp; \
    jekyll b -d tmp_site/ -b / &amp;&amp; \
    ln -s /home/ryan/irclogs/freenode/mlpack/ tmp_site/irc/logs &amp;&amp; \
    ln -s /home/jenkins-mlpack/workspace/blog/script/blog/doxygen tmp_site/gsocblog &amp;&amp; \
    mkdir old_site/ &amp;&amp; \
    mv "$1/"* old_site/ &amp;&amp; \
    mv tmp_site/* "$1/" &amp;&amp; \
    ln -s "$1/doc/$newest_version" "$1/doc/stable" &amp;&amp; \
    rm -rf tmp_site old_site;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(That's from  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack.org&gt;https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.)  You can see that the last four lines are actually what deploys the website and it should be instantaneous.  ( there is the destination directory for the deployed website.)
