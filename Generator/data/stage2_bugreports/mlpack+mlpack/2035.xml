		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/KimSangYeon-DGU&gt;@KimSangYeon-DGU&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I took a look into this one today but I haven't seen any OS X test failures for  in the past month or so (looking at the Travis build history).  I think that maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2026&gt;#2026&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 solved this one---have you seen the issue since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2026&gt;#2026&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was merged?

, I think it is a temporary issue that occurs rarely because I haven't seen any issue since I opened this one. I'll close it until I find the same issue.
