	<summary>Some old contrib/ code uses incorrect fx function signatures</summary>

Each has a different particular error during compilation, but I suspect that the fx API was updated and these bits of code never were.  These should be very simple fixes.  Here is the list I've come up with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;contrib/nvasil/all_centroid_knn/
contrib/nvasil/non_convex_mvu/
contrib/pram/lle/
contrib/pram/opt/
contrib/pram/sparsepca/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Huh, I thought my list was longer than that.
