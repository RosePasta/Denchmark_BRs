		Hi, can you please provide a more complete build log?  The CMake output would be very helpful, too.  Also, how do you have Armadillo configured?  (i.e. is ARMA_USE_WRAPPER enabled?)  Thanks!

		Hi,
I make armadillo and mlpack again, and now I get a new issue.
"""
/bin/sh: 1: /home/asuka/Documents/mlpack/CMake/allexec2man.sh: not found
CMakeFiles/man.dir/build.make:77: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/man' failed
but allexec2man.sh exists.
Attach my CMakeOutput.log

		Hi there,
Can you provide more information about what you are doing (i.e. what commands you are using)?  Try removing your mlpack sources entirely and starting over.  If allexec2man.sh doesn't exist, something has gone wrong somewhere.  If you can get back to having the original issue you mentioned, we can debug that better then.

		Hi,
I used mkdir build create a directory build and cd build, then
cmake ../, the issue I first mentioned after recompiling armadillo
disappeared.
So now I encount allexec2man.sh not found error, but I have checked
the directory, allexec2man.sh exists correctly.

		Did you restart with a clean environment?  allexec2man.sh is a file that is part of the git repository, and there is no CMake rule that should remove it.  My guess is that you've removed it by accident somehow.

		Does the file exist inside of your git repository?  You're not providing very much information here, so it's hard for me to figure out what is going on.  What would be preferable is this:

a detailed log of how to reproduce the error (from a clean start)
information on your system (what OS, what version of CMake)
your CMakeCache.txt and all of the output from cmake ../
whether or not allexec2man.sh exists in the right place on the system (/home/asuka/Documents/mlpack/CMake/allexec2man.sh?)

If you can get me all of that information, it'd be helpful for figuring out what is going on here; thanks.

		Attach my output of allexec2man.sh.
first I run allexec2man.sh, error is /bin/nash^m: bad interpreter,
after I run dos2unix allexec2man, then this log generated.

		I think the issue here is that /bin/nash is not a suitable replacement for /bin/bash.  Is it possible on your system to install bash and then try again with that? (i.e. make it so /bin/bash is its own executable, instead of a symlink to /bin/nash)

		Well, I really did not install nash and I don't know what nash is.
Bash is the default shell of GNU Debian, some other applications rely on
it, so I ensure that there's nothing wrong with /bin/bash.

		What you've told me is that /bin/bash is symlinked to /bin/nash.  Presumably this was the choice of some Debian maintainer somewhere inside the project, though I can't say I have any Debian systems where this is the case (and Debian is my distribution of choice).  If bash is symlinked to nash, then bash is not actually installed: nash is installed and is posing as bash, and my theory here is that nash is not actually a suitable drop-in replacement for bash.
In order to test that theory, though, I'd need you to find a way to install bash (or at the very least make sure /bin/bash runs bash, not nash), and try the rebuild.
In looking a little deeper here, I can't find any evidence anywhere that Debian even packages nash, and if it is this nash: &lt;denchmark-link:http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/nash8.html&gt;http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/nash8.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 then that isn't a suitable replacement for bash at all and I have no idea how your system is even running.  So, I don't know what could have possibly caused this issue on your system, but I'd be willing to bet that this is the problem.
