	<description>
Hi, there,
going through the JOSS checklist for the software review, I saw that the LICENSE.txt and COPYRIGHT.txt are slightly out of sync:
LICENSE.txt:

Copyright (c) 2007-2016, mlpack contributors (see COPYRIGHT.txt)

COPYRIGHT.txt:

Copyright 2008-2018, Ryan Curtin ryan@ratml.org
...

For the version that will get archived with the JOSS paper, it's maybe best to update the License file with the most up to date copyright info

		Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1408&gt;#1408&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
---thanks for pointing it out.  Just a minor oversight.
