	<summary>Python binding warnings are inaccurate or misleading</summary>
	<description>
The warnings in bindings to other languages are generally written for command-line programs; example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; o = logistic_regression(training=x, labels=y, lambda_=0.5)
[WARN ] --output_file ignored because --test_file is not specified.
[WARN ] --output_probabilities_file ignored because --test_file is not specified.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but neither of those warnings make very much sense.  We need a way to write generic error or warning messages that can be automatically reformatted for the language at hand.
