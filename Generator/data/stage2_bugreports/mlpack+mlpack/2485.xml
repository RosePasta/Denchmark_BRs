&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description of problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

MathJax JS Library is not loaded, so that the equations do not render.  This is probably affecting multiple pages, however I checked only said page.

		Thanks for the report.  I think actually this is something slightly different.  It looks like some of the equations---which should be compiled as s---aren't actually being created due to Doxygen not successfully compiling them as LaTeX formulas.  I found a bug in the Doxygen documentation (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2488&gt;#2488&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and after fixing that I'm rebuilding the 3.3.2 documentation now.  Hopefully, when that's done, everything will work (I'll provide another update then). 
If it does work, the mlpack-git documentation will automatically rebuild and be fixed once &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2488&gt;#2488&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is merged.

		Ok, this seems to render fine now: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.2/doxygen/lrtutorial.html&gt;https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.3.2/doxygen/lrtutorial.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It may still be better to switch to using MathJax at some point, but this is at least adequate in my opinion.
Unless you find any other errors, I'll go ahead and close this once &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2488&gt;#2488&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is merged and the mlpack-git documentation rebuilds.
