; I'm in the process of resurrecting the other PR you suggested there, hopefully that will be open later today (currently debugging a test).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ashishsiyag&gt;@ashishsiyag&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you could either apply that PR to your branch, or another workaround would be to use an older version of Armadillo.

		It looks like the configuration still succeeds.  If you're not intending to build the Go bindings, you don't need to worry about those messages.  If you are intending to build the Go bindings, can you provide the outputs of /usr/local/bin/go version?

 I intend to work on issue 2592 , so before starting with it, I wanted to get mlpack running on my system.

 in that case, I wouldn't worry about the Go bindings---you shouldn't need them for development.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ashishsiyag&gt;@ashishsiyag&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , since you would be working on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/2592&gt;#2592&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  I don't think go bindings are necessary just run a sample program to check if everything else is good
And rest you are good to go

 , Please refer &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2572#issuecomment-678107849&gt;#2572 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , We recently had some changes with test
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2572#issuecomment-678107849&gt;#2572 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

you can run ./bin/mlpack_catch_test "[KNNTest]"
also about the second issue, can you run 2-3 times to check if that happens every time , I think  it is a random failure, Also The are some memory access violation possible , We have a issue open for that  : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/2386&gt;#2386&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 please read the above comment and linked comment we migrated some of the test from boost to catch
bin/mlpack_test -t KNNTest is wrong
And knn is in not in mlpack_test it's in mlpack_catch_test , mlpack_catcg_test are all test written in catch where is the other one is boost
So please build make mlpack_catch_test and then run
bin/mlpack_catch_test "[KNNTest]"
