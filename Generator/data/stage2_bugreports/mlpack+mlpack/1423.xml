	<summary>build fails with txt2man installed</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to build mlpack with the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cmake -DBUILD_CLI_EXECUTABLES=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF ..
make
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Although cmake succeeded, but make was complaining with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Scanning dependencies of target mlpack_gitversion
[  1%] Updating gitversion.hpp (if necessary)
-- Found Git: /usr/bin/git (found version "2.7.4") 
-- gitversion.hpp is already up to date.
[  1%] Built target mlpack_gitversion

[  2%] Updating arma_config.hpp (if necessary)
-- Regenerating arma_config.hpp.
[  2%] Built target mlpack_arma_config
Scanning dependencies of target man
make[2]: *** No rule to make target '../mlpack_sparse_coding', needed by 'CMakeFiles/man'.  Stop.
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:173: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/man.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/man.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:138: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I realized that the CMake code that is making trouble is inside the else part of
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if (NOT TXT2MAN)
    message(WARNING "txt2man not found; man pages will not be generated.")
  else ()
    . . .
endif ()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

so, I removed the txt2man from my system and tried to build again and it succeeded .
System Information: Ubuntu 16.04, CMake 3.11, gcc/g++ 7.3

		Oh, interesting, I see what the issue is.  If BUILD_CLI_EXECUTABLES is OFF then the man pages can't be built.  Another solution would be to set BUILD_CLI_EXECUTABLES=ON.  Fix coming...

		Thanks again for the report---the fix is now merged in, so if you update the code there should be no issue.  I will release mlpack 3.0.2 tomorrow with that fix and a few others.
