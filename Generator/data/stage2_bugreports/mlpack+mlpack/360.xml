After running cmake ../ I run the make command and here is the process:
$ make

I have installed armadillo and I don't know how to deal with this problem.

Hi,
Can you tell me more about the system you are compiling on and the compiler you are using?  Attaching the CMake output and CMakeCache.txt file may be helpful too.
Thanks,
Ryan

		He should be on Windows or very old Mac. execinfo.h is one of non-portable parts in gnulib.

		I'll try to reproduce this with Cygwin if I get a chance.  If this can be reproduced then the fix should be as straightforward as changing the logic a bit, so that if gnulib is being used on some platform where execinfo.h doesn't exist, then Log::Assert() doesn't print a backtrace at all.

		I think this issue is resolved and should be closed, because Log::Assert() doesn't use execinfo.h anymore. It's replaced by:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#ifdef HAS_BFD_DL
  #include "backtrace.hpp"
#endif
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Check it in: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/blob/master/src/mlpack/core/util/log.cpp#L10&gt;log.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		You're right, we can now close this. :)
