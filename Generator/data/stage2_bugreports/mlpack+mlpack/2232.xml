		You haven't written what operating system version you are using.  That would be important information to diagnose this issue, as older versions of Ubuntu (if I'm guessing correctly that that's what you are using) don't have those packages available, and you would either need to (a) build them from source (b) use mlpack's auto-downloader in the CMake configuration or (c) upgrade your operating system.

		You can consult the documentation for each of those packages for (a), and for (b), CMake will automatically download the ensmallen and STB dependencies if they are not found.

		Even after CMake installs ensmallen and STB dependencies I get the following error

		Since the master branch doesn't have the build folder so I tried to copy the build of mlpack-3.2.1 to master branch and replaced every occurrence of mlpack-3.2.1 to mlpack in CMakeCache.txt.
And this is what I got...

		Hello!
I want to make a PR and update the documentation as my first contribution.
Althought the README on github states that we need to build the dependencies from source, but the following link:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.2.2/doxygen/build.html&gt;https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.2.2/doxygen/build.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

states that we can get the dependencies from apt-get, whereas the command given in the following image have a few problems:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jAeR2taGOiBlPIBttxP5BV_BrREFxsH/view?usp=sharing&gt;https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jAeR2taGOiBlPIBttxP5BV_BrREFxsH/view?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The version of armadillo installed by this is older than the one required by mlpack. (It installs version 6.something)
The library libensmallen-dev and libstb-dev are not found by apt-get.

This may be my system's drawbacks, so any comment would be appreciated.
Also the exports to be done for LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH in the end have been mentioned under the heading "Using mlpack without installing", whereas i needed to do it anyways.

		I opened &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2235&gt;#2235&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to help clarify some of these things, especially the second point above and the original reason this issue was opened.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/saraansh1999&gt;@saraansh1999&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you want to find the minimum version of Ubuntu that has a suitable version of Armadillo?  If you can find that then we can update the documentation to point out what to do if a new enough version of Armadillo is not available.  (I'd suggest looking at &lt;denchmark-link:https://packages.ubuntu.com/&gt;https://packages.ubuntu.com/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, for instance.)

Did you read &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.2.2/doxygen/build.html&gt;https://www.mlpack.org/doc/mlpack-3.2.2/doxygen/build.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I searched for armadillo using the link you provided.
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=armadillo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (Copy and paste the link. Direct click isn't working for some reason.) clearly finds armadillo6 in 16.04, but armadillo8.4 onwards from 18.04.
So I guess Ubuntu 18.04LTS onwards would install armadillo8.4 or above which is the requirement for mlpack.

		Sounds good---do you want to update the documentation to point out that the correct Armadillo dependency may not be available on Ubuntu versions before 18.04, and that if the user is using an older version of Armadillo, they should compile and install it from source?

		<comment id='20' author='anishk74' date='2020-02-24T16:51:50Z'>
		yes thank you.
I will do that
just to clarify, I need to edit mlpack/doc/guide/build.hpp ?

		<comment id='21' author='anishk74' date='2020-02-24T16:54:04Z'>
		Yes, that's the file, but maybe it's worth looking at README.md too to see if you think there is anything in there that should also be clarified. 👍

		Is there a proper formatting standard for the docs? If yes, could you guide me to some documentation for the same. Thanks!
		</comment>
		<comment id='23' author='anishk74' date='2020-02-24T17:00:43Z'>
		It's just doxygen: &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.doxygen.nl/&gt;http://www.doxygen.nl/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For formatting standards, see the existing style guidelines in the Github wiki and also just use complete sentences in the documentation (since people using this documentation may not have the best English skills, it's good to keep it grammatically correct :)).

		How do i preview the changes i have made locally in doxygen.
I tried dyoxygen *.hpp in the folder  mlpack/doc/guide/ but the html files generated are not looking like the ones online. What am i doing wrong?
		</comment>
		<comment id='25' author='anishk74' date='2020-02-24T17:30:40Z'>
		You should be able to just run doxygen from the build directory (or even make doc or make doxygen).  The HTML files on the website use specific styling that isn't part of the main repository (long story); so it should be fine to just make sure that the document you modified displays reasonably locally, and it'll be fine once it's merged and on the main website.

My bad. Using CMake for the first time
