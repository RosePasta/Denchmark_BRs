	<summary>LocalCoordinateCodingTestCodingStep hangs on sparc64</summary>
	<description>
If you run
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mlpack_test -t LocalCoordinateCodingTest/LocalCoordinateCodingTestCodingStep
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

on a sparc64 machine, sometimes it will hang.  I noticed this in the matrix build.
I will debug this myself since sparc64 is such a rare architecture I doubt many people have access to it; this issue is just a note to myself so that I remember to do it...

		263ebbf6b at least adds iteration limits to keep the test from hanging.

		This seems to be fixed now---the sparc64 tests are no longer hanging.
