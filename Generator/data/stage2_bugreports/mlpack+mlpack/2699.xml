	<summary>compilation warnings due to deprecated matrix initialisation via &amp;lt;&amp;lt;</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html&gt;Armadillo 10.x&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, matrix initialisation via  is deprecated.   This comes up as lots of warnings during mlpack compilation.
For example, see :


Instead of using , the preferred way is to use C++11 &lt;denchmark-link:http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#element_initialisation&gt;braced initialiser lists&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  Examples:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;vec v = { 1, 2, 3 };

mat A = { {1, 3, 5},
          {2, 4, 6} };
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Using C++11 braced initialiser lists will also work with earlier versions of Armadillo, such as 8.400.

		I'm wondering what the reason behind the change is, is it to keep things simple?

 Using  for matrix initialisation pre-dates the existence of C++11.  For Armadillo 10.x, the minimum supported C++ standard has been increased to  C++11, where the braced initialiser list is a superior solution (ie. cleaner and more efficient).

		This is a really nice first issue for anyone looking to get started contributing to mlpack.  It's not particularly exciting but could expose you to a good part of the codebase. :)  Basically all we need to do is replace everywhere where we use &lt;&lt; with the braced initializer lists that Conrad suggests.  I think most of the usages of this should be in src/mlpack/tests/, but there may be other places too.

Thanks for the clarification, makes sense.

  I am new to mlpack . I want to contribute towards this issue so that I get familiar to the codebase.

		I am getting an error while using braces to initialize an arma::mat having one column. For matrices with more than one columns, brace initializer is working fine. The error message is
ambiguous overload for ‘operator=’ (operand types are ‘arma::Mat’ and &lt;brace-enclosed initializer list&gt;)
Someone please help me.

 If you think it's a bug, create a small self-contained program which shows the issue and report it at the Armadillo repo: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gitlab.com/conradsnicta/armadillo-code&gt;https://gitlab.com/conradsnicta/armadillo-code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
