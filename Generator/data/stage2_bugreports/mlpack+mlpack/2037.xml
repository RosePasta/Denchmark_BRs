	<summary>Cannot compile mlpack on Ubuntu 18.04 and below</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Compiling the master branch of mlpack without libstb-dev gives the errors:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In file included from /home/favre49/mlpack/src/mlpack/core/data/load.hpp:23:0,
                 from /home/favre49/mlpack/src/mlpack/core/util/cli_impl.hpp:19,
                 from /home/favre49/mlpack/src/mlpack/core/util/cli.hpp:329,
                 from /home/favre49/mlpack/src/mlpack/core.hpp:72,
                 from /home/favre49/mlpack/src/mlpack/bindings/tests/clean_memory.cpp:14:
/home/favre49/mlpack/src/mlpack/core/data/image_info.hpp:29:10: fatal error: stb_image_write.h: No such file or directory
 #include &lt;stb_image_write.h&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, libstb-dev is only available for Ubuntu eoan and Ubuntu disco. Hence, it isn't possible for users with older versions to compile.
This problem also exists for libensmallen-dev, but can be compiled from source.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack: master branch
operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
compiler: gcc 7.4.0
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo): Sufficient
any other environment information you think is relevant:

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run make mlpack_test on a machine on Ubuntu 18.04 and below.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Code compiles.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Interesting, I'm a bit surprised because if STB isn't found, then mlpack should automatically download it.  Can you also provide the output of the CMake configuration step?

Do you mean it's not detected by CMake, as libensmallen doesn't depend or use stb.

		Just tested cmake -DDOWNLOAD_STB_IMAGE=OFF .., which disables STB; haven't encountered any issue.

		I tried it on my own machine.
To solve it delete your current build directory. Make it once again and run cmake ../ once again. It will resolve everything.

		Sorry for the late reply, been busy.
Thanks for the suggestions, deleting the build file and starting over worked for me. Works as I had expected now.
