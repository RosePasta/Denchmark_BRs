	<summary>Temporary matrix (neighborPtr) being improperly deleted in neighbor_search_impl.hpp</summary>
	<description>
File neighbor_search_impl.hpp
on method:
void NeighborSearch&lt;SortPolicy, MetricType, MatType, TreeType, TraversalType&gt;::
Search(const MatType&amp; querySet,
const size_t k,
arma::Mat&lt;size_t&gt;&amp; neighbors,
arma::mat&amp; distances)
At line 461:
---&gt; delete neighborPtr;
But in this case, when treeOwner is false, the matrix neighborPtr is not allocated with "new".
