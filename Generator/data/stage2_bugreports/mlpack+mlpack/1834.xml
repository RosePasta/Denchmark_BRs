	<summary>Build problem $ENV{DESTDIR} got expanded on cmake call</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I think you have a mistake in your cmake scripts.
You use $ENV{DESTDIR}.
This gets expanded during cmake generating the files for Unix make.
So it gets set to the value the env-var has when calling cmake.
But this should be set to the DESTDIR variable when calling DESTDIR=... make install!
I need this escaped in the form \$ENV{DESTDIR}.

		I would like to work on this issue. Where did you find that $ENV{DESTDIR} in the source code.

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chandramoulirajagopalan&gt;@chandramoulirajagopalan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
this is my current patch against 3.0.4 tag to support 64-bit arch targets and to make it install in DESTDIR for bundling.
Although up-to-now the python bindings doesn't work on import. But there is another issue for this at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1760#issuecomment-479570820&gt;#1760 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The $ENV{DESTDIR} is in src/mlpack/bindings/python/CMakeLists.txt. You can find in patch-file.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kolbma&gt;@kolbma&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for the report.  Have you tried against the git master branch?  There were some fixes for this in the time past.  I understand the report and you are right that at least in 3.0.4 the problem exists exactly as you describe it.  However, newer versions use  as a script that's called directly at install time, and I think this may not have the problem you described.  Can you give it a shot and let us know if the problem is still there?  Thanks!
