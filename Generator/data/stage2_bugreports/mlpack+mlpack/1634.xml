	<summary>6 failures are detected in the test module "mlpackTest"</summary>
	<description>
Dear dev team,
I ran the mlpack_Test and got 6 failures as the result. I known that we can safely ignore the one in GaussianMatrixSensingSDP but i am now sure about the others.
Please have me to take a look at it,
Thanks,

		I think that I've adjusted the tolerance for the GaussianMatrixSensingSDP test, so in future releases that shouldn't be an issue.
The others are more concerning though.  I see two "types" of error:

Something to do with serialization.  This covers SerializationTest/LayerNormSerializationTest, SerializationTest/EmptyHoeffdingTreeTest, and possibly PreprocessImputerMainTest/PreprocessImputerDimensionTest and PreprocessImputerMainTest/PreprocessImputerListwiseDimensionTest.
A failed eigendecomposition for SdpPrimalDualTest/SmallLovaszThetaSdp test.

I can try and reproduce the second on my system (I think it is a random failure, but we can take steps to mitigate that), but are you willing to help debug the first a bit?  The key is here:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; input stream error
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I've seen that a few times, all on OS X systems, all recently, and it's an error from boost::serialization.  I see you are using version 1.68 on OS X.  Could I ask you to try an older version of Boost and see if the error still occurs?  I am not sure if it is a regression in Boost or what.  The newest version I have in the package repositories is 1.67 (I am on Debian), so I'll try that and see what happens.  I know from the CI tool that 1.66 works (at least on Linux systems), so if you can test 1.66 that would be helpful.

		Hi Ryan ,
I tested 1.66 on OS X systems and also got the same problem. I can try to test it again with Linux systems tomorrow.

		Ok, thanks for looking into that.  So we can rule out Boost version issues as the cause.  If you can try on a Linux system also that would be great.  I have been unable to reproduce the issue on the Linux systems I have, but I might borrow a Macbook tonight to see if I can reproduce it there.

		HI Ryan,
I have a chance to run a quick test on my friend's computer and it passed successfully. But now when I tried to compiled a simple problem it gave me error. DO you have any idea, I though that include the -lboost_system would have fixed it but it didn't.
Thanks

linking against boost_program_options should solve the issue, so the build command should look something like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;g++ -std=c++11 -lboost_serialization -lboost_program_options -lboost_system -o test test.cpp -DDEBUG -g -rdynamic -lmlpack
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

: I spent some time looking into this and managed to find an OS X system to reproduce the problems on.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1640&gt;#1640&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should fix the failing tests, so once that's merged I think we can close this issue.
