	<summary>repeated use of internal Armadillo functionality</summary>
	<description>
Internal function "arma::diskio::guess_file_type()" has been marked as deprecated in Armadillo 9.800+, in order to allow mlpack to transition to another solution and to avoid using internal armadillo functionality (which is subject to change and/or removal without notice).
This was popping up as a warning during compilation of mlpack.
However, the current "fix" in mlpack (by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Yashwants19&gt;@Yashwants19&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) seems to be a repetition of the same problem (ie. another use of internal functionality) in order to avoid the deprecation warning. Instead of using "arma::diskio::guess_file_type()", mlpack now uses "arma::diskio::guess_file_type_internal()". Clearly this is not the intended result.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/commit/49f782ad95fc8af41ca23b8ca45442a36808a5a0#r41903672&gt;49f782a#r41903672&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
