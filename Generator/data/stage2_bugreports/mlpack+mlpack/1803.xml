		Did you happen to run a make clean and then run make? I'm unable to reproduce this error, and I don't think the nightly builds are failing either. Please provide a link to the Travis logs where the failure is occuring?

, This issue is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1777&gt;#1777&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Actually, we have kept tack of where the source of the issue is. And we took an measure to decrease the error rate in the  temporarily.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ShikharJ&gt;@ShikharJ&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, Should we increase the number of trials more, until we find the source of the problem?

 I don't see how that would help. Five trials is more than enough in my opinion. The error seems to be limited to Mac OS builds, which have had a problem with these tests since the time we started building on OSX.

		Closing this for now, this needs to be handled in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1661&gt;#1661&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
