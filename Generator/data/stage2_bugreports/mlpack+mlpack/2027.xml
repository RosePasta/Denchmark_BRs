	<summary>Impossible to build mlpack_test</summary>
	<description>
Hello everyone,
I just cloned the mlpack rep on my computer and I cannot build all the targets from  make mlpack, especially mlpack_test and some generate_pyx. (May be it is normal)
For example, here is the final error that I get during the failure of make mlpack_test :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;src/mlpack/tests/CMakeFiles/mlpack_test.dir/build.make:277: recipe for target 'src/mlpack/tests/CMakeFiles/mlpack_test.dir/async_learning_test.cpp.o' failed

make[3]: *** [src/mlpack/tests/CMakeFiles/mlpack_test.dir/async_learning_test.cpp.o] Error 1
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:7610: recipe for target 'src/mlpack/tests/CMakeFiles/mlpack_test.dir/all' failed
make[2]: *** [src/mlpack/tests/CMakeFiles/mlpack_test.dir/all] Error 2
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:7622: recipe for target 'src/mlpack/tests/CMakeFiles/mlpack_test.dir/rule' failed
make[1]: *** [src/mlpack/tests/CMakeFiles/mlpack_test.dir/rule] Error 2
Makefile:2112: recipe for target 'mlpack_test' failed
make: *** [mlpack_test] Error 2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I did not modify the mlpack/CMakeLists.txt and the the BUID_TEST option is still set to ON.
If it can help, I don't have any problem from an installation of mlpack-3.1.1 that I made by following the webpage documentation.
I did not find any answer to this problem on the web. If someone know the solution, I would be glad to read it.
Thank you.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mercierc&gt;@mercierc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I think I know what the issue is. What version of ensmallen do you have installed?

		Hi  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and thank you for aswering. I built mlpack from the git-hub rep on another computer and it works with ensmallen 2.10, downloaded during the execution of the cmake command. I will keep you informed about the version installed on the concerned computer as soon as I can acces it.

		Good to hear.  The concerned computer likely just needs the version of ensmallen 2.10.0 for the git master branch.  I opened &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2028&gt;#2028&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to update the documentation and CMake configuration about the minimum version needs.

		I started again with the modifications of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rcurtin&gt;@rcurtin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it works well.
