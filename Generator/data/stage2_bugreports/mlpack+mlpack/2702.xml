	<summary>Cereal Compiling CMake problem in /CMakeList.txt</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have encountered the problem when I tried to build the mlpack from the master branch (not the current release 3.4.2). The problem is about cereal package not being installed when I execute the command cmake ../. We can build normally from the version 3.4.2 because its /CMakeList.txt does not have the line find_package(cereal "${CEREAL_VERSION}" REQUIRED) as in line 416 the same file in the master branch.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Your environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack: master branch
operating system: Ubuntu20
compiler:
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo):
any other environment information you think is relevant:

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Build cmake from master branch, without any cereal package installed.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We should write cmakelist to automatically download, setup, and configure for us, not having to manually install any package.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Currently apt-get install cereal just install version 0.x.x of cereal, which is not compatible with the current requirement of the mlpack package. So even when we install cereal package, it still does not work.

 You must use  for installing the required cereal package.

		Thanks ! That definitely help! Is it neccessary to edit cmakelist so that it automatically download and install. If yes then I can work on it!
