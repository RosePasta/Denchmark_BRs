	<summary>new mlpack website has old download link</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:http://mlpack.org&gt;http://mlpack.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 provides a download link for mlpack 3.1.1, which is outdated; should be 3.2.2 ?

		Crap! It was supposed to deploy to a test location during merge. I will have it fixed before I go to bed.

		Ok, the link at least seems correct now. I still have to do a pass on the whole site to make sure everything is right, but the biggest issue is fixed for now.

: I think the links @ &lt;denchmark-link:http://mlpack.org/getstarted.html&gt;http://mlpack.org/getstarted.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 are still pointnig to the previous mlpack version (MSI/ZIP).
Also, the link to github was not updated (&lt;denchmark-link:http://mlpack.org/github.html&gt;http://mlpack.org/github.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) - there is a comment in the MD that says it should get updated during deployment.
Looking nice!

 thanks for pointing that out---fixed now.  I can't see any other issues with the deployment, so I'll work on turning the rest of the comment into issues on the mlpack/mlpack.org repository.
