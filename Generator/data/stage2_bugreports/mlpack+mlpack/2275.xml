	<summary>testReturn of q learning agent won't improve</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have been test the Deep Q Learning module on the MountainCar environment. I copied some code from "q_learning_test.cpp" for this. I have found that the average reward increases from -400 to -321 after training for 150 episodes. But on testing the thing with 20 episodes, the averageReturn is still -400, meaning that not a single Car actually crossed the goal in the testing phase. This might be due to some error my code(pasted below). This could also mean that the "q_learning_test.cpp" is also not implemented properly.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;// ---------TRAINING PHASE--------------
int max_episodes = 150;
while (episodes &lt; max_episodes)
{
episodeReturn = agent.Episode();		// training
averageReturn(episodeReturn);
episodes += 1;
cout &lt;&lt; "Average return: " &lt;&lt; averageReturn.mean()
    &lt;&lt; " Episode return: " &lt;&lt; episodeReturn &lt;&lt; std::endl;
if (episodes == max_episodes)
{
	// ---------TESTING PHASE----------------
	agent.Deterministic() = true;		// enter testing mode
	arma::running_stat&lt;double&gt; testReturn;

	for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; 20; ++i)		// run for 20 test episodes
		testReturn(agent.Episode());

	cout &lt;&lt; "Average return in deterministic test(after " &lt;&lt; episodes &lt;&lt; " training episodes): "
			&lt;&lt; testReturn.mean() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	// -------------------------------------
}
} // end of while
// --------------------------------------
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
