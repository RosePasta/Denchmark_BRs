	<summary>Model()[1].Parameters() does not work in FFN</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I believe this bug has been indicated in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1906&gt;#1906&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but I can't seem to have it working.
I tried to use model.Model()[1].Parameters() to extract the weights of the network, given the simple use of Parameters() - model.Parameters() - gives a fairly complicated, not so useful thing. I am told by the compiler there is no such member called Model().
I tried adding
const std::vector&lt;LayerTypes&lt;CustomLayers...&gt; &gt;&amp; Model() const { return network; }
in the FFN class - "~/mlpack-3.1.1/src/mlpack/methods/ann" - but with no success.
The "not rebuild solution"
#define private public
doesn't do the trick for me.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


version of mlpack: 3.1.1
operating system: Ubuntu 19.04
compiler: cmake 3.13.4-1
version of dependencies (Boost/Armadillo):
ensmallen-1.15.1
boost-1.67.0.1
armadillo-9.500.2

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Opened &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/2043&gt;#2043&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, checkout the test case for an example.

		Well, the instantiated network can now be exposed, so that's all on my end : )
