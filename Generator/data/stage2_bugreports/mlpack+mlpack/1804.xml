&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Problem location&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

README.MD --&gt; 4. Building mlpack from source --&gt; See&lt;denchmark-link:http://www.mlpack.org/docs/mlpack-git/doxygen/build.html#build_config&gt; this section of the build guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more details, including a full list of options, and their default values.
The same happens with many other links @ README.MD
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description of problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The link doesn't work - probably after the recent changes to the documentation/website
