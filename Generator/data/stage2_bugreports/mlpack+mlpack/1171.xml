		Hi,
This is far too little information to be able to help you solve the problem.  Can you tell us:

What command you run that produced the output.
The full compilation error.
What version of Armadillo you are using.
What version of mlpack you are using.
How you installed Armadillo.
What system you are running on.

		The old version(Armadillo: 8.300.0) do not have this problem!

		I dug into this one a bit and did reproduce it.  It's actually a typo in the Armadillo code, and will be fixed with the next release (8.300.3 I think).  If you'd rather get it fixed now, your options are to use the older version of Armadillo or apply the change in this patch:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/conradsnicta/armadillo-code/commit/fd77c9078e074a14f4b963f759bde5208c7bf09c&gt;conradsnicta/armadillo-code@fd77c90&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'll go ahead and close this issue (please feel free to open another one if you have any more problems).
