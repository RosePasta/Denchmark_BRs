&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Note :
This does not happen in fresh install
Do the following
Clone the repo, create build hit cmake ../ and make mlpack_test and then ./bin/mlpack_test
and now create a branch and then again hit make mlpack_test or cmake ../ and mlpack_test  and finally ./bin/mlpack_test and you will get the error
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Should compile without any error
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Note :
I didn't try to debug it, Since I was working on something else, I will take a look later, but happened to make a couple of times
strange now it happens for fresh install too, So I have to debug this first and then move ahead :-p

		Hey, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jeffin143&gt;@jeffin143&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
