		Agreed on all three counts, thanks.  Do you want to open a PR?  I'd be happy to commit these with your name on the patches and add your name to the list of contributors if you like.  (And, we also mail stickers you could put on your laptop or wherever to people who have contributed!  So if you want I can get some in the mail too.)
