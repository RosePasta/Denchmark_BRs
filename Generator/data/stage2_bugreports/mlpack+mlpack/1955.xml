	<summary>Can't install mlpack on Fedora 30 due to Boost version mismatch (1.69.0 vs 1.66.0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When trying to install mlpack, mlpack-devel, mlpack-bin on Fedora 30, I get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Problem 2: conflicting requests
  - nothing provides libboost_program_options.so.1.66.0 needed by mlpack-2.2.5-8.fc30.i686
  - nothing provides libboost_serialization.so.1.66.0 needed by mlpack-2.2.5-8.fc30.i686
  - nothing provides libboost_program_options.so.1.66.0()(64bit) needed by mlpack-2.2.5-8.fc30.x86_64
  - nothing provides libboost_serialization.so.1.66.0()(64bit) needed by mlpack-2.2.5-8.fc30.x86_64
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The version of Boost in Fedora 30 is 1.69:

		Thanks for the report---weird that the boost maintainers did not rebuild the mlpack package for the boost upgrade (they usually do). In any case I am actively working on upgrading the mlpack Fedora package to mlpack 3, but that requires ensmallen to be present in the Fedora repositories as it is a new dependency. But ensmallen just went into the stable repos a day or two ago so now I can finish the upgrade process.
I'll keep you updated and let you know how to install the package even before it gets to stable. üëç

		Thanks! Meanwhile I can unblock myself by building from source (but also running into &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/issues/1928&gt;#1928&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ok, here's the update for mlpack 3.1.0:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-8ca6d0ca5c&gt;https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-8ca6d0ca5c&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But, stupidly, I realized that I had built these RPMs for an older version (now 3.1.1 is out but it's basically the same).
I think (but am not 100% sure) that you can get the package just by doing
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;dnf install mlpack --enablerepo=updates-testing
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

though maybe you want some of the other related packages like mlpack-bin, mlpack-devel, mlpack-python, or mlpack-python3, or maybe mlpack-doc.
Let me know if there are any issues.  And probably the 3.1.1 update will also be pushed in the next day or two... just waiting on the rebuilds now...

		We could leave this open until it's released into the regular repo and I re-verify then?

		üëç that seems reasonable to me.  I'll post a comment when it pushes to the stable repository.
