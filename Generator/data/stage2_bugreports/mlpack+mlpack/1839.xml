	<summary>Regarding Python dependencies</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Problem location&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

MLpack Documentation .Readme
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description of problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The documentation doesn't specifically talk about python dependencies as they are generalised for python2.x. I would like the documentation to be more particular for different python versions as python2.x will be deprecated soon.

		Please point to the exact documentation that is not compatible with Python 3.  The dependencies in the readme are not specific to any version of Python.
