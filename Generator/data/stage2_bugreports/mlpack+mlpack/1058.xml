		Hello, this link is working for me: &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.mlpack.org/docs/mlpack-2.2.3/doxygen.php?doc=classmlpack_1_1neighbor_1_1RASearch.html&gt;http://www.mlpack.org/docs/mlpack-2.2.3/doxygen.php?doc=classmlpack_1_1neighbor_1_1RASearch.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you tell us which link references to the one you mentioned?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zoq&gt;@zoq&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  clicking the API corresponding to RANN in this page &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.mlpack.org/about.html&gt;http://www.mlpack.org/about.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 leads to the link I had posted above,  Maybe it is linking to some older link.

		Sorry! I was working on this Friday, I thought I had everything patched back up by the time I left.  I'll handle it when I get home this afternoon.  I'll let you know when it is done and the doxygen output will look a lot nicer too. :)

		Fixed.  The correct link now is &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.mlpack.org/docs/mlpack-2.2.3/doxygen/classmlpack_1_1neighbor_1_1RASearch.html&gt;http://www.mlpack.org/docs/mlpack-2.2.3/doxygen/classmlpack_1_1neighbor_1_1RASearch.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , and I updated about.html to reflect that.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
