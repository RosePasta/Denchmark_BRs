	<summary>Implementation of Double Q Learning</summary>
	<description>
The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions.
Double Q Learning proposed in (&lt;denchmark-link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) leads to a better performance in several games.
I have started working on it and hoping to open a PR soon !!
