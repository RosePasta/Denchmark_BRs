	<summary>Module tests fail because of segfault in cuDNN destructor</summary>
	<description>
The tests pass functionality wise, but in the clean up, the test segfaults. It seems like this is a issue others have seen in libtorch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/17658&gt;pytorch/pytorch#17658&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
