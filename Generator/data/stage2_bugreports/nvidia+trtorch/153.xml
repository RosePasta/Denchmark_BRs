	<summary>üêõ [Bug] Windows crash at runtime</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I created a TRTorch 0.0.3 for Windows and have noticed it crashes at runtime when registering the operators.
Backtrace:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61218/87925825-33391080-cac4-11ea-9ba6-991fe3989059.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Schema:
trt::execute_engine(Tensor[] inputs, __torch__.torch.classes.tensorrt.Engine engine) -&gt; Tensor[]
Function it dies in, while parsing schema:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/4a3aad354a14edb1337c6214c3d3870c136d5286/torch/csrc/jit/frontend/schema_type_parser.cpp#L307&gt;https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/4a3aad354a14edb1337c6214c3d3870c136d5286/torch/csrc/jit/frontend/schema_type_parser.cpp#L307&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Use Windows
Use my precompiled TRTorch
Link to TRTorch

Prebuilt is available in PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/TRTorch/pull/152&gt;#152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or for debug library:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/TRTorch/files/4947139/trtorch-0.0.3-debug.zip&gt;trtorch-0.0.3-debug.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Runs
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		I am currently working required updates to TRTorch to be compatible with 1.6.0. There are some issues i have hit from using the 0.0.3 branch. Perhaps that is the root cause? When I compiled on windows I used the 1.5.1 official build from pytorch.org. Ill see if i can replicate once the update is complete.

 Any update on this?
More details, exception is:
Unknown custom class type tensorrt.Engine. Please ensure it is registered.:
trt::execute_engine(Tensor[] inputs, torch.torch.classes.tensorrt.Engine engine) -&gt; Tensor[]

		I just wrapped up the update to 1.6.0, so I can start to take a look at this. Do you have a short example program that can replicate this issue? Right now what I see is that some of the example applications we have seem to be able to start up properly without hitting this issue.

		Every model I've tested seems to hit this issue. I couldn't find a way to not reproduce this.
It could be I'm doing something wrong elsewhere. I'd be excited to see a path where this error doesn't occur!
