	<summary>üêõ [Bug] Docker container build fails on Ubuntu 18.04</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I'd like to try the Jupyter notebook here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NVIDIA/TRTorch/tree/master/notebooks&gt;https://github.com/NVIDIA/TRTorch/tree/master/notebooks&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

When I try  I get this error on Step 14:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Step 14/21 : RUN bazel build //:libtrtorch --compilation_mode opt
 ---&gt; Running in d67d7bd7b5b8

I'm on a Google Cloud instance with Ubuntu 18.04, Python 3.6 and CUDA 10.2.
Thanks

		Think this is just a matter of updating the Notebook container dockerfile

		Can you please explain a bit more? I tried FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt:20.07-py3 in the first line of notebooks/Dockerfile.notebook instead of the old version 20.03, but then I get this error below. I've CUDA installed, so the path /usr/local/cuda-10.2 definitely exists.

		Did you find a way to make this run on a container?

		Nope  :( I'm gonna try building from scratch unless there's a response.

		Notebooks should be updated, reopen if there are issues.
