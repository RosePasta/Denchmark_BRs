	<summary>Roc curve, other metr</summary>
	<description>
Hey, does anyone tried to plot a ROC curve for autokeras? I tried sklearn.metrics.roc_curve  but it did not work because the size of array is wrong. Maybe someone has an example.
Thank you very much

 How are you passing the roc_curve to AutoKeras?
I am not sure whether we are supporting this feature or not.
Would you please paste the code which produces the error?
Thanks.

		clf = ImageClassifier(verbose = True)
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve,roc_auc_score
y_test_cat_prob=clf.predict(x_test)
fpr , tpr , thresholds = roc_curve( y_test , y_test_cat_prob)
i used sklearn. I have a multiclass classification, it does not support multiclass format

 You can use the current master branch to export your model using  of ImageClassifier. Then, you can use the exported Keras model to output the probs.
