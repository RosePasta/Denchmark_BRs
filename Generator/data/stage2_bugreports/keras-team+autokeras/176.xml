&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The issue remains that the test accuracy is 1.0.
It seems like the following two lines in metrics.py
        prediction = list(map(lambda x: x.argmax(), prediction))
        target = list(map(lambda x: x.argmax(), target))
mess it up and therefore have to be removed. If they are removed, then prediction and target are passed to accuracy_score directly  which is then yields the same as if I use it manually.
I have not submitted a pull request since I am not entirely sure if that will mess up some other part of autokeras. As of now I would say: No. I am not sure if def _test in utils.py is used ever (for something relevant). But you certainly know the source code much better.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproducing Steps&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Step 1: ...
Step 2: ...

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Show the real accuracy.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Setup Details&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Include the details about the versions of:

OS type and version:
Python:
autokeras: 0.2.12, master, develop
scikit-learn:
numpy:
keras:
scipy:
tensorflow:
pytorch:

 thank you for letting us know. That line should not be changed since it is for the model trainer mainly. We are investigating the issue. Thanks.
