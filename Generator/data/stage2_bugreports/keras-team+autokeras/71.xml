Describe the bug:
Running an simple MNIST data classification.
I was able to run for the first time. Next day, I tried to run the same program, I got this error message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(asr) maybe@maybe1:/data/jugs/asr/languageclf$ ./trainalutokeras.py 
from: can't read /var/mail/keras.datasets
from: can't read /var/mail/autokeras.classifier
./trainalutokeras.py: line 5: syntax error near unexpected token `,'
./trainalutokeras.py: line 5: `  (x_train, y_train),(x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I think this is a Keras related issue.
Since it is not calling the autokeras code yet before it crashes.
If you feel it is not, you can reopen the issue.
Thank you for your contribution.
