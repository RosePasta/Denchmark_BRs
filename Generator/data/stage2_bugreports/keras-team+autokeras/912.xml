	<summary>Save AutoKeras Model</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
Once i want to save my AutoKeras Model with the export_model() Function:
ak_classification = ak.StructuredDataClassifier( name="autokeras_model", directory="models", max_trials=2, seed=42)
ak_classification.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_split=0.2)
I get following Error:
AttributeError: 'StructuredDataClassifier' object has no attribute 'export_model'
Would be happy if somebody could provide me with some help!

 Would you please confirm your AutoKeras version?
The export model function only exists in the latest version. 1.0.0

 We don't have this error.
`Python 3.6.6 (v3.6.6:4cf1f54eb7, Jun 26 2018, 19:50:54)

import autokeras as ak
ak.StructuredDataClassifier.export_model
&lt;function AutoModel.export_model at 0x13d6da598&gt;
`



You may try python3 -m pip install --upgrade autokeras if you are using python3 as your command for executing the python file.
We are currently not supporting export the structured data classifier unless the final found model is a neural network.
So even you can use that function it might not work as expected for now.
I will add this to the export model tutorial later.
