	<summary>Autokeras not able to load best model</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I was spending the whole day trying to play around with autokeras for an image classification problem. I installed the newest version and updated tensorflow to 2.1.0. I never got it to work with my (Kaggle leaf) dataset so I figgured that I would just try it with the example code from the autokeras website:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import autokeras as ak

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
print(x_train.shape)  # (60000, 28, 28)
print(y_train.shape)  # (60000,)
print(y_train[:3])  # array([7, 2, 1], dtype=uint8)


clf = ak.ImageClassifier(max_trials=3)

clf.fit(x_train, y_train)

print('Accuracy: {accuracy}'.format(
    accuracy=clf.evaluate(x_test, y_test)))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The whole thing seems to do just fine during training of different models having an accuracy or &gt;0.9. However, in the end it says: "INFO:tensorflow:Oracle triggered exit" and the finished model has an accuracy that is no better than random guesses. Furthermore, I get the following warnings:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;INFO:tensorflow:Oracle triggered exit

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seems like autokeras is unable to retrieve its best models. Can anyone help me with this issue?

		Did you figure this out? I have the same issue. I let it run overnight and the results are useless, though it worked the first time. Lost a lot of time
