	<summary>[Feature request]fit_generator style training from Keras</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Feature Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Use a python generator to generate input data for flexibility.
This feature was ever requested once, but the issue was closed somehow while there's no alternative APIs.
Thanks.

		AutoKeras is not usable without fit_generator I feel. It is limited to toy problems!

		I agree, if fit_generator is applied, this module will become very popular. Sparse integration would also be nice.

		Let's use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/autokeras/issues/984&gt;#984&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to track this generator issue. Thanks.
