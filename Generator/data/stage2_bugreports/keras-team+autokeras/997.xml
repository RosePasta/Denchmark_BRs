	<summary>Training stops after several trials</summary>
	<description>
Hello
I have experienced early termination of the number of trials, for example the training stopped at trial nr. 3, while I gave as parameter "max_trials=190"
How can this be prevented?

		Apparently this hasn't happened with 1.0.2, only in 1.0.1.
Thanks
