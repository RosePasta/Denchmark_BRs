autokeras.classifier.load_image_dataset failed silently
x_train, y_train = load_image_dataset(csv_file_path="***_train.csv", images_path=".")
print(x_train.shape)
print(y_train.shape)
***_train.csv contains 100k lines of image path and labels
I try to do load_image_dataset, and wish to get x_train.shape. However, it doesn't print any value.
so is the load_image_dataset not able to handle 100k data size?

		Thank you for your interest.
I think it can.
Did you try the load_raw_data example?
