	<summary>Autokeras does not work on Windows due to fork</summary>
	<description>
I have windows machine with CUDA 10.0, Cudnn 7.5, and Python 3.7. I have successfully installed Tensorflow 1.11 and confirmed it works with non-trivial examples.
I installed Autokeras 0.2.19 and tried to run the example below:
import autokeras as ak
from keras.datasets import mnist
if name == 'main':
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape + (1,))
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape + (1,))
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;clf = ak.ImageClassifier(verbose=True)
clf.fit(x_train, y_train, time_limit=12 * 60 * 60)
clf.final_fit(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, retrain=True)
y = clf.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(y)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The following is the output:
Using TensorFlow backend.
Initializing search.
Initialization finished.

raise ValueError('cannot find context for %r' % method) from None
ValueError: cannot find context for 'fork'
It looks like Autokeras is using fork, which I believe from Googling is not supported on Windows. If this is the case, is there a work-around or is this a known limitation?

 Yes, you're right, Windows doesn't support . The recent why we use  is just to be able to run it on Google Colab. So I think this issue can be easily addressed by detecting the current structure. I'll take care of it ASAP!

		Great. Please also ensure that you address the use of virtual environments. I changed my local copy to use spawn instead of fork but I am having issues that I believe may be related to my virtualenv for tensorflow.

		Finally got it working after I copied some code from a post showing how to copy the environment info over. Also, when I first ran it, I kept getting an access denied error. I found a different post that suggested that I change to the directory of the process (my virtualenv). That fixed the issue. Lastly, you need to add the NVDIA-SMI directory to your path or you get:
'nvidia-smi' is not recognized as an internal or external command

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/csteel45&gt;@csteel45&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , will the error cause Autokeras to crash? Or it just appear on the terminal?

		It will crash

		So I got i right, under Ubuntu it will work and i didnt get the fork error?

		Correct. It doesn’t work under Windows which doesn’t support fork. Instead, you need to change the fork to a spawn so that it is cross-platform. The alternative is to check the OS and call fork for Unix-based systems and Spawn for Windows-based systems.

  Sorry, I was on travel this week.
In search.py change the line: ctx = mp.get_context('fork')
to
ctx = mp.get_context('spawn')
I added some extra code to address running in a virtualenv so I don't have the exact line number.
