I try to saved best model, and load.
but i have
Loading saved model causes Unknown layer: Normalization error

i cannot upgrade autokeras version, because autokeras 1.0.3's accuracy is not good.

		You can pass the normalization layer as a custom object while you load the model.
Would you please provide your dataset? So that we can tune our algorithm to see why it doesn't perform good. Thanks.
