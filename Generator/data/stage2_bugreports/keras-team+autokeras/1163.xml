		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/KirkDCO&gt;@KirkDCO&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , Can you please try again using the method mentioned in : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/achaar/autokeras/blob/img_reg_tutorial/docs/templates/tutorial/image_regression.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/achaar/autokeras/blob/img_reg_tutorial/docs/templates/tutorial/image_regression.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please update the AutoKeras-tuner also.
Thanks.

		I'm not sure I understand what method you're referring to.   The code you linked uses an ImageRegressor and is very focused around that concept instead of a StructuredDataRegression.
Regarding updating AutoKeras-tuner, are you referring to keras-tuner (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner&gt;https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)?  The example pulls from a specific commit which seems very unmaintainable.
		</comment>
		<comment id='3' author='KirkDCO' date='2020-06-02T16:45:11Z'>
		Yes, you can use the specific commit for the time being. The issue will be resolved in the next release.
I was referring to the installation procedure for AutoKeras and keras-tuner.
		</comment>
		<comment id='4' author='KirkDCO' date='2020-06-02T17:35:27Z'>
		Ah, that makes more sense.
I have installed that version of keras-tuner, am pulling from master on autokeras, and have tf 2.2.0.  Still the same error.
I also tried keras-tuner/master as described in an e-mail from Haifeng Jin earlier today.  Same error there, too.
		</comment>
		<comment id='5' author='KirkDCO' date='2020-06-02T18:09:39Z'>
		Okay, then we'll try to resolve this and get back as soon as possible.

		I am seeing this as well with structured_data_classifier after trying the various combinations of code mentioned earlier.  I get the error a lot of the time though not always and when it fails I can verify that the checkpoint  does not exist under the trials_xx/checkpoints/epoch_yy path. The directory parameter is specified as an absolute path and grep doesn't seem to show that the file has been saved somewhere else as far as I can see.

		I am seeing this as well using ImageClassifier on Google Colab connected to Google Drive. Usually everything is fine with a smaller number of trials/epochs. However when I increase this number (right now I am doing 10 trials and 200 epochs) I get the error and the epoch directory does not exist. This seems to be a bit different of an error than what &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pingusix&gt;@pingusix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is experiencing, since he seems to indicate that the epoch directory does exist.
I was wondering if it could have something to do with getting disconnected from Google Colab, but based on the reports here it seems like it is not the case.
I'm using autokeras 1.0.3, keras tuner 1.0.2rc0, and tensorflow 2.2.0.

		Originally, this error is because Keras Tuner deletes the old checkpoints saved on disk to reduce the disk usage. However, we have fixed this in a recent pull request (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner/pull/318&gt;keras-team/keras-tuner#318&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Not sure why still exists.

 Would you share a colab notebook for the reproduction? Thanks.

@chyt Would you share a colab notebook for the reproduction? Thanks.

How would I share this notebook with you? The code is pretty straightforward, but the dataset is loaded from Google Drive.
Edit: here is a Gist of the notebook: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/chyt/79e2f9de030c11e990af8595e7da631b&gt;https://gist.github.com/chyt/79e2f9de030c11e990af8595e7da631b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can see the error near the bottom of the output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor: Failed to get matching files on /content/drive/My Drive/image_classifier/trial_6a080628b2d822154a54edc6187850b6/checkpoints/epoch_67/checkpoint: Not found: /content/drive/My Drive/image_classifier/trial_6a080628b2d822154a54edc6187850b6/checkpoints/epoch_67; No such file or directory

 It seems you are facing multiple bugs while using AutoKeras. It would be great if we can schedule an one hour meeting to help you debug. We can use half of the meeting to debug and half of the meeting for you to answer some of our user study questions. You can join our slack and message me your email address. Thank you!

 I'm having the same issue. ak is trying to restore epoch 2, which was not persisted:
ValueError: Unsuccessful TensorSliceReader constructor: Failed to get matching files on /data/auto-clf-20-epochs-4-trials/trial_479975cd710064c8120d0f95a2c0b230/checkpoints/epoch_2/checkpoint: Not found: /data/auto-clf-20-epochs-4-trials/trial_479975cd710064c8120d0f95a2c0b230/checkpoints/epoch_2; No such file or directory
However epoch 2 was not persisted during training:
ls /data/auto-clf-20-epochs-4-trials/trial_479975cd710064c8120d0f95a2c0b230/checkpoints
epoch_0  epoch_10  epoch_11  epoch_12  epoch_3  epoch_4  epoch_5  epoch_6  epoch_7  epoch_8  epoch_9
Is there anything I can do to help fix this issue?

 Are you using overwrite=False? If you let overwrite=True, I think the error would gone.

		Here is the colab to reproduce the error:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jOzTuL26UZaISnSZkUD273yZ1cqrX1QL?usp=sharing&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jOzTuL26UZaISnSZkUD273yZ1cqrX1QL?usp=sharing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The error seems to appear when patience is higher than the variable self._save_n_checkpoints (hardcoded =&gt; 10) of kerastuner/engine/tuner.py:
See callbacks=[tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(training_objective, patience=50)] in the colab.
With this configuration, for an unknown reason, the best checkpoint is removed and then when autokeras is looking for it, it crashes.
It may be a problem with the function "save_model(self, trial_id, model, step=0)" defined in kerastuner/engine/tuner.py
A hack would be to increase self._save_n_checkpoints to patience.
