&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi, everyone! When I try to use autokeras fit some data and label, I encounter such warnings as:
"semaphore_tracker: There appear to be 1 leaked semaphores to clean up at shutdown   len(cache))"
After some iterations, for example, after prompt "Model 9", the program is hanging due to insufficient memory.
I don't think it has connection with my code, here is my code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from autokeras.image_supervised import ImageClassifier
import numpy as np

if __name__ == '__main__':
    x_train = np.load('x_train.npy')
    y_train = np.load('y_train.npy')
    x_test = np.load('x_test.npy')
    y_test = np.load('y_test.npy')
    x_train = x_train.reshape((-1, 32, 32, 3))
    y_train.reshape((-1, 1))
    x_test = x_test.reshape((-1, 32, 32, 3))
    y_test = y_test.reshape((-1, 1))
    clf = ImageClassifier(verbose=True)
    clf.fit(x_train, y_train, time_limit=12*60*60)
    clf.final_fit(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, retrain=True)
    pred = clf.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
    print(pred)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The magnitude of my dataset is similar to CIFAR10.
I want to know, how to fix this warning and following memory issue? Does anyone has experience in fixing such things? Thanks in advance.

		I experienced the same warning.

		Same issue here. But how long will autokeras terminate on MNIST training? It's training on my mac in 8 hours. As screenshot below.

How to get the resulted model? Which path does these models save?
