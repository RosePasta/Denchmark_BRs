	<summary>clf.fit(x_train, y_train, time_limit=1) running for a long time on mnist</summary>
	<description>
Not sure if the argument time_limit is used here. This function is running for a very long time.
clf.fit(x_train, y_train, time_limit=1)
Any possible reason?
Mac:
Python 3ish

		same issue +1.
I expect
clf.fit(x_train, y_train, time_limit=2 *60 *60 )
to execute about 2 hours, but didn't stop regardless of 2 hrs pass by.

 I got to know that I you have to define the time limit in the step before that
