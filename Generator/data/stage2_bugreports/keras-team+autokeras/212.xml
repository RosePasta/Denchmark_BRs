	<summary>"numpy.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError: N-th leading minor of the array is not positive definite" exception while training ImageClassifier</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When training ImageClassifier on float inputs of shape 80x92x24 on a binary classification task, this exception is thrown when AutoKeras lists all created models until this point and their respected losses and metrics. Here is a more complete log + stack trace:  &lt;denchmark-link:http://termbin.com/gb3n&gt;http://termbin.com/gb3n&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproducing Steps&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Create a dataset of noise shaped 80x92x24 with ~360 or so samples
Respective binary labels.

In my case, some values of the dataset are quite large (they vary between 0 and 1_000_000, but I'm not sure that this is related since AutoKeras performs normalization).

Have it train on a GTX 1070Ti or equivalent in terms of vram for about an hour (can't confirm that it's GPU-related either).
Wait for the exception

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It should work.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Setup Details&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS type and version: Ubuntu 18.04
Python: 3.6
autokeras: 0.2.14 (installed manually from git)
all dependencies are installed as stated in requirements.txt for this release, unless for:
tensorflow 1.10, compiled locally.

 Thank you for the report.
I think this has been fixed in the develop branch.
Will be released soon.
