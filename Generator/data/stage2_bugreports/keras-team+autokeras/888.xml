&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I tried to use 'StructuredDataRegressor', the error happens.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import autokeras as ak
auto_sdr = ak.StructuredDataRegressor()
auto_sdr.fit(train_X, train_y)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


AttributeError:
module 'autokeras' has no attribute 'StructuredDataRegressor'

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

OS: Windows10
Python: 3.6.7
tensorflow: 2.0.0
autokeras: 1.0.0b0
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Check the directory of autokeras package&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is not StructuredData file at the directory of autokeras package.
(However, there are image and text file)
Is there any way to solve this?

 We cannot reproduce the error. It might because the python interpreter you use is not the one you installed the 1.0 version of AutoKeras.
If you are running your program with command .
You can try this . to see the version.

		This is because the environment recognize the ak package as the one in the tests folder. directly install autokeras instead of cloning the repo would solve the problem.
