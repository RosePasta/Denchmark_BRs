&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When i exported model with method ImageClassifier, i get an exception

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/codecrack3&gt;@codecrack3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , thanks for your interesting in our package. I test the code on Google Colab and I didn't get any errors.
As for your errors, it seems to be a pytorch problem which has something to do with , and it was fixed in pytorch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/2517&gt;issue 2571&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, please take a look if you are interested. So my suggestion is try to make sure the torch version is the latest.
Also, I have added the example of export and load keras model in example folder.
If you still get this problem, please feel free to let us know. And please add your settings such that we can repeated the bug.
Thanks,
Boyuan
