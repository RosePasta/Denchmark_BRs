what error ?

When I run the code, "audio = TFMelGANGenerator(**config["generator_params"])(inputs)" line raises an InaccessibleTensorError.
InaccessibleTensorError: The tensor 'Tensor("conv2d_346/dilation_rate:0", shape=(2,), dtype=int32)' cannot be accessed here: it is defined in another function or code block. Use return values, explicit Python locals or TensorFlow collections to access it. Defined in: FuncGraph(name=call, id=140430667155440); accessed from: FuncGraph(name=call, id=140430364789896).
Do you not meet any error on your side?

		I reproduced this issue on colab.
The reason of this error seems the version of tensorflow (colab uses  now).
Please install  like this.

I reproduced this issue on colab.
The reason of this error seems the version of tensorflow (colab uses 2.2.0-rc0 now).
Please install tensorflow-gpu==2.1 like this.


Thank you for your support. re-installing tensorflow fixed the issue.
But may I ask you a question about converting the model to tf-lite model?
I have amended the cell &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN/pull/3&gt;#3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the colab, to let input pass through the network. But I encountered another error in converting to tf-lite, the link is below.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ch7nkIzVx69Ol1ir-2LT2tXInXYBeavb&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ch7nkIzVx69Ol1ir-2LT2tXInXYBeavb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For some reason, the dimension does not match when converting and the error shows as "Check failed: dim_x == dim_y (2000 vs. 2006)Dimensions must match". Do you have any idea why it occurs?

		Actually, I'm not familiar with tensorflow, but your already shows some hints.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seems that the needed library is not installed.
At first, you should install related libraries such as libnvinfer.so.6 and check the behavior again.
If this issue is not related to the installation of TensorRT, I have no idea about that.

 Do you have any suggestions?

 :)))), i don't know how to say now :v. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/John-K92&gt;@John-K92&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  You should fix by yourselft in this case :))), i cann't share everything about how to convert it to tf-lite models ^^. Just modify some line of code u can convert it successfully, don't care about libninfer.so.6. The error is Check failed: dim_x == dim_y (2000 vs. 2006)Dimensions must match.

		OK. This issue is out of supports of this repository.
Please fix it by yourself. I will close this issue.
If you find the solution and share it with us, it is nice for the other users.
