	<summary>Filtering out the empty images by default</summary>
	<description>
I notice that on the customized dataset, the data loader by default will filter out empty images (image without annotations) on the testing set during testing. Is there a particular reason for doing so? Thanks!
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    CLASSES = None

    def __init__(self,
                 ann_file,
                 pipeline,
                 classes=None,
                 data_root=None,
                 img_prefix='',
                 seg_prefix=None,
                 proposal_file=None,
                 test_mode=False,
                 **filter_empty_gt=True):**
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		It is just a common practice because images usually have GT in COCO/VOC datasets.

Thank you for your reply! I tried to set filter_empty_gt=False, but it still not work when testing on the customized dataset (meaning it will filter empty images as well during testing). I find related questions on this issue and it requires us to modify coco.py code. Any plan to address this bug (forgive me if "bug" is not a proper word here)?
Thanks!

		If there are no defect in my image, do I need to write bbox [0,0,0,0] into my annotation
