Hi, I was trying to run vfnet config, but an error raised,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;   File "/data/work/mmdetection/mmdet/models/dense_heads/vfnet_head.py", line 403, in loss
&gt;     pos_inds.new_tensor(num_pos).float()).item()
&gt;   File "/data/work/mmdetection/mmdet/models/dense_heads/vfnet_head.py", line 24, in reduce_mean
&gt;     tensor.true_divide_(tensor.new_tensor(dist.get_world_size())),
&gt; AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'true_divide_'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

package version is :
mmdet: latest version
pytroch: 1.3.1
mmcv: 1.1.6
Can someone help me? thanks in advance.

		the version of pytorch is too old, upgraded to version 1.6 can solve this problem

		This should be an incompatibility bug. We will fix it to make it compatible with Pytorch 1.3 until Pytorch 1.3 is no longer supported.
