	<summary>Test mask rcnn failed</summary>
	<description>
I only have one gpu, so my test mask rcnn script is :
python tools/test.py configs/mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200205-d4b0c5d6.pth --out results.pkl --eval bbox segm
but it run failed and reported error as below:

My environment info as follows:
pytorch: 1.6.0+cu101
torchvision: 0.7.0+cu101
gcc: 5.4.0
cuda: 10.1
Addition：I test/train FasterRcnn successful, it's not any error, but MaskRcnn will crash when I test or train
I don't know why, is there anyone can help me ? Thank you in advance！

Hi! I do not seem to be able to reproduce your problem. Please provide more information by following the template of reporting an error.

Sorry for not following the template，now my new description is as follows：
My target is to test maskrcnn by one gpu


What command or script did you run?
python tools/test.py configs/mask_rcnn/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py 
checkpoints/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_coco_20200205-d4b0c5d6.pth 
--show-dir mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_results


Did you make any modifications on the code or config? Did you understand what you have modified?
I'm not change any thing, only make a data dir and checkpoints dir to place dataset and your trained models


What dataset did you use?
coco2017


Please run python mmdet/utils/collect_env.py to collect necessary environment information and paste it here.



You may add addition that may be helpful for locating the problem
I install pytorch by pip


If applicable, paste the error trackback here.



If there is anything else I shoud add, please let me know，thank you for your attention！

		This does seem to be a problem. It is due to the Conv2d in mmcv.ops being deprecated. We will fix it soon.
For now you can fix it by editing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/94008233957a49c4a1f708da2122d5059957f6cb/mmdet/models/roi_heads/mask_heads/fcn_mask_head.py#L5&gt;this file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Add Conv2d to line 5 and remove line 6.
