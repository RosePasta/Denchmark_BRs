	<summary>Random corp doesn't include in Semantc seg pipeline therefore not consistent</summary>
	<description>
In the transform.py, SegResizeFlipPadRescale will do the same thing that training image did, but when we apply random crop, the semantic seg won't change, therefor the shape will meet an error.

		Hi, I also want to check if our semantic class exceed 255, how can I adjust to use it. Currently my problem is I used coco image with different annotation (from 80 classes to 1k+ classes), I would like to add semantic branch but the semantic png image is annotated by its pixel value, will it matter if we don't re-map them? Or Semantic head's classes don't influence mask head classes at all?
