	<summary>mAP@75 returns -1.</summary>
	<description>
The tools/test.py was giving correct results a few days ago. Since I am working on google colab, I cloned the most recent  mmdetection repository today. But now the same code returns -1 for mAP@ 75.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.416
Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.571
Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.75      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = -1.000
Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.070
Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.473
Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.842
Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=  1 ] = 0.048
Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets= 10 ] = 0.382
Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.458
Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= small | maxDets=100 ] = 0.096
Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=medium | maxDets=100 ] = 0.526
Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.876
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The same code was returning 0.475 for mAP@75 a few days back.
Reproduction

What command or script did you run?

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python tools/test.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Did you make any modifications on the code or config? Did you understand what you have modified?
Ans: Yes, I modified the config to use custom coco format datastet with one class.

I suspect recent changes to coco.py (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/3407&gt;#3407&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) may have something to do with it. But since I am a new user of mmdetection, I wouldn't know for sure.
