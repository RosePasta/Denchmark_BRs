 scalar_t c2 = (t &gt;= 0 &amp; t != d); 





When num_classes in bbox_head isn't  consistent with the max class number in ann_file,
this won't throw any error,  add a check like t &lt; num_classes  may avoid some mistakes

		Thanks for your advice. We would appreciate if you would you like to create a PR to add num_classes checking to make it more friendly.
