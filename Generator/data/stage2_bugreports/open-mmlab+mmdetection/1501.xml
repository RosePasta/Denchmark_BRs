	<summary>TypeError: object of type 'DataContainer' has no len()</summary>
	<description>
I installed the Docker image as mentioned in install.md and then tried testing the Faster RCNN model using the instructions provided in Getting_started.md
I ran the following code
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python tools/test.py configs/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_20181010-3d1b3351.pth --show
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I got the following output
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;loading annotations into memory...
Done (t=0.59s)
creating index...
index created!

    for img_id in range(len(img_metas)):
TypeError: object of type 'DataContainer' has no len()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have downloaded the checkpoint file and saved it in the checkpoints folder as mentioned above. I have also downloaded the COCO data and placed it in the directory as instructed in install.md
I am not able to understand the exact reason of the error.
What I can say is that this term is causing the error,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;len(img_metas)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So I just printed the object right before where the error is caused
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print(img_metas)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and I got the output
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;DataContainer([[{'filename': 'data/coco/val2017/000000397133.jpg', 'ori_shape': (427, 640, 3), 'img_shape': (800, 1199, 3), 'pad_shape': (800, 1216, 3), 'scale_factor': 1.873536299765808, 'flip': False, 'img_norm_cfg': {'mean': array([123.675, 116.28 , 103.53 ], dtype=float32), 'std': array([58.395, 57.12 , 57.375], dtype=float32), 'to_rgb': True}}]])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

if this helps in any way.
Please help me understand the error.
Thank you

 i got the same problem while i run test.py with grid-rcnn-r50, it is strange that the type of  is &lt;class 'mmcv.parallel.data_container.DataContainer'&gt;,  it has no len(), have you solved it?

Could you try to use the option --out ./debug.pkl rather than --show to see what happen?
I do not have the GPU host now so I cannot use the --show option, but I am checking the code to see what happens.

  I kind of get the problem solved. It could be very likely that this script requires a GPU environment. Once I switched to GPU host, the problem disappeared in no time.
Hope it helps!

how to switched to GPU host?

how to switched to GPU host?

Do you run the code with at least one GPU card or just with CPU?

Thanks a lot!
It seems that the current script needs to run with at least one GPU now and we may not test it on CPU before. We will check it further.

		I tried the same command with a GPU as reported in this issue:
python tools/test.py configs/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py checkpoints/faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x_20181010-3d1b3351.pth --show, I met no bug.
However, when I did not provide GPU and ran the command, I met this bug.
So for now, I am certain that this bug is caused by running scripts without using GPU.
A temporary solution is to do the inference with at least one GPU (please make sure you indeed use the GPU by, e.g., torch.cuda.is_avaliable() first). I will check the bug further in the mmcv.
