	<summary>Maybe certain bugs exists in the RoIPool cuda source file "roi_pool_kernel.cu"</summary>
	<description>
When I change the roi_layer from dict(type='RoIAlign', out_size=14, sample_num=2) to dict(type='RoIPool', out_size=14) in the config file "faster_rcnn_r50_caffe_c4_1x.py" and remain other settings unchanged, there will be a cuda memory error occurs, which shows:

THCudaCheck FAIL file=/pytorch/aten/src/THC/THCCachingHostAllocator.cpp line=265 error=77 : an illegal memory access was encountered

While if I switch to the Torchvision RoIPool by setting roi_layer=dict(type='RoIPool', out_size=14, use_torchvision=True), there would be no errors.
Thus I guess there maybe certain bugs exists in the RoIPool cuda source file, could you please double check it? Thanks.
