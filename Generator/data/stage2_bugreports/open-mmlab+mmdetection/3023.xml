	<summary>DataLoader seems to ignore samples without objects</summary>
	<description>
Dear All,
am I right that DataLoader ignores samples without objects? I have just noticed that the data set length shown in INFO during training is slightly lower than the actual data set length. Just for my understanding, how can I force DataLoader to load all images (I'm training Faster RCNN on data in PASCAL VOC format)? Setting filter_empty_gt to False does not make a difference.
Thanks!
Best,
Alexey

		Using MSCOCO dataset, I think filter_empty_gt works fine when first loading the data, then the data is filtered by get_subset_by_classes found in mmdetection/mmdet/datasets/coco.py.
Adding a condition if self.filter_empty_gt to the function this way
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def get_subset_by_classes(self):

    ids = set()
    if self.filter_empty_gt:
        for i, class_id in enumerate(self.cat_ids):
            ids |= set(self.coco.catToImgs[class_id])
        self.img_ids = list(ids)

    data_infos = []
    for i in self.img_ids:
        info = self.coco.loadImgs([i])[0]
        info['filename'] = info['file_name']
        data_infos.append(info)
    return data_infos
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

seems to do the trick on my side for MSCOCO, it might give you an idea for your case.
Cheers!
