	<summary>Xavier_init bugs when normorlize is enable?</summary>
	<description>
In fpn structure, the repo uses xavier_init for convs.
However, when normorlize is enable (I try to use nn.GroupNorm), It produces error "Nonetype object has no attribute fill_".
I found this occured when initializing bias which does not exist.
In face, it seems that in the model/utils/weight_init.py, the "hasattr(module, 'bias')" expression is always right

		Thanks for reporting the bug! Initialization methods in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/blob/master/mmcv/cnn/weight_init.py&gt;mmcv.cnn.weight_init&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is more reliable.
