	<summary>Bug with backends</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When doing:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;export SCATTERING_BACKEND=torch
cd scattering_transform/scattering/scattering2d/tests
pytest test_scattering.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I obtain the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;===================================================================================== ERRORS =====================================================================================
_______________________________________________________ ERROR collecting scattering/scattering2d/tests/test_scattering.py ________________________________________________________
ImportError while importing test module '/home/eugene/forkedouard/scattering_transform/scattering/scattering2d/tests/test_scattering.py'.
Hint: make sure your test modules/packages have valid Python names.
Traceback:
test_scattering.py:5: in &lt;module&gt;
    from scattering.scattering2d import Scattering2D

    ???
E   ImportError: cannot import name 'cdgmm3d'

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It works like a charm when doing
export SCATTERING_BACKEND=skcuda
or when not assigning SCATTERING_BACKEND
The main reason is that for some reasons, the 3D tries to import its own backend, even when doing 2D test. It's a bit annoying because since this, I do not test the 2d scattering code and it has plenty of bugs that I try to fix in: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/pull/57&gt;#57&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

My attempt to fix this bug is: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/edouardoyallon/scattering_transform/blob/small_bug/scattering/scattering3d/backend/__init__.py#L65-L67&gt;https://github.com/edouardoyallon/scattering_transform/blob/small_bug/scattering/scattering3d/backend/__init__.py#L65-L67&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yeah that is why I created the env variable SCATTERING_BACKEND_2D and SCATTERING_BACKEND_3D so you could be selective about this.
You can also change it in the config file ~/.config/scattering/scattering.cfg (make sure you go check that because it may have set torch for 3D inadvertently)
If you set SCATTERING_BACKEND then you set the same for all the transformations.
Does this solve the issue?

Annoying: (just trying to incorporate a feature for 1D)

To solve this you need to make the 1D backend split

This doesn't look like a fix ... (I think I commented on it in the PR)

Let me try but at least, I understand the spirit, which I didn't get initially!

		You might need to delete/modify ~/.config/scattering/scattering.cfg (but it
is overridden by env variables)
&lt;denchmark-link:#&gt;…&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
