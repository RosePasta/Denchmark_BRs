	<summary>python 3.6 required for pip install</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
pip install is not working because it requires python 3.6 as indicated here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/kymatio/&gt;https://pypi.org/project/kymatio/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Kymatio is supposed to work with python 3.5 as indicated by the logo on the website: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.kymat.io/index.html&gt;https://www.kymat.io/index.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks,
	</description>

		Ah yes, i think that this is because we were excited about PEP 498 on literal string interpolation, but did not reflected it in the badges.

What do you think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eickenberg&gt;@eickenberg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Wait, where does it break?
We had started out supporting only 3.6 (though it worked in 3.5) and
explicitly added official 3.5 support because people were asking for it.
Aren't we then also testing with 3.5 and our tests pass?

		No idea. This is what I get when running pip install:

		It does not break in Python, it breaks in pip install, because the PyPI page does not list Python 3.5

		Hi Guys, has this not been fixed? Running Python 3.5.3
pip3 install kymatio
produces error listed in this issue.

 if you insist on Python 3.5, my recommendation is to install from source
