	<summary>RuntimeError: fft: ATen not compiled with MKL support</summary>

when I run the examples , output like this:
Sx = scat(x)

RuntimeError: fft: ATen not compiled with MKL support
May be the MKL version doesn't match?

		Thanks for your report!

How did you install pytorch? The conda install from the website is the
easiest to get it to work because anaconda ships with mkl by default. If
you install numpy before pytorch, then you should have it.

In your file path I see it says "anaconda2" - is that because it's a
duplicate of another anaconda or because the install is the python 2.7-
based one, with py36 installed on top?

		Which example did you use actually?
The line that you are citing does not exist in the current codebase.

		Could be related to this:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/issues/194&gt;cornellius-gp/gpytorch#194&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Seems like doing the conda install or compiling pytorch from source may be the way to go.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jainszhang&gt;@jainszhang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, your problem probably goes up to an issue in PyTorch installation. We recommend installing with PyTorch and Kymatio through Anaconda, as noted in the link that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/janden&gt;@janden&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 shared.
I am closing this because we cannot reproduce the issue, and you haven't replied in the past three weeks. Feel free to reopen this if the bug persists.
