	<summary>`plot_invert_scattering.py` is not portable</summary>
	<description>
Specifically, it has to be run from its own directory, which is inconvenient. The reason is the line 


kymatio/examples/2d/plot_invert_scattering.py


         Line 26
      in
      fff9792






 img_name = "./images/baboon.bmp" 




 which specifies the image as a relative path from the working directory. Ideally, this would be done in a way that finds the file by looking at the path of the script instead.
