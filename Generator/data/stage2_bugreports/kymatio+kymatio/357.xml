	<summary>`cdgmm` doesn't check that both inputs are on the same device</summary>
	<description>
This is at least true for the 2D torch cdgmm. It only complains when you try to multiply tensors. We should throw an error instead.

		This seems to be the case for all the other cdgmms as well.

		For this specific case, as this routine is common between 1-2-3D, this could be done jointly with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/261&gt;#261&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		I think we should do &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/issues/261&gt;#261&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 first, then this one. Will be easier that way. Might make sense to do them in the same PR, though.
