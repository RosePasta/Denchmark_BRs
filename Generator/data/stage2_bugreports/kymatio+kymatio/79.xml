Hi,
Those files :
mnist.py|synthetic.py|real_signal.py|scattering3d_qm7.py
do not pass in sphynx gallery because there is no doc string. I'm willing to removing the warning also

		For the scattering3d_qm7 we will have to ship the coefficients, because it takes too long for them to compute - nobody will be able to build the docs if that example has to run.
Or at least we could make the qm7 coefficients downloadable, so that the example can load them and only needs to do the ridge regression

 it's ok to exclude some fimes, let's just make clear which files.
