	<summary>Unexpected crush with J=1</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I faced the following problem: I get unexpected and unexplained crush when J=1 regardless of other parameters values. Please, find the code and the error message below.
Here's the code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;data = torch.Tensor(np.random.rand(128,3,32,32))
print("shape before scattering: {}".format(data.shape))

scatModel = Scattering2D(J=1,L=8, shape = (32,32), max_order=2)
a = scatModel(data)

print("shape after scattering: {}".format(a.shape))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the error message:

shape before scattering: torch.Size([128, 3, 32, 32])
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/user/HS221/dm00314/PycharmProjects/ScatterNetsTestFramework/venv/mixingMallatTest.py", line 24, in 
a = scatModel(data)
File "/user/HS221/dm00314/PycharmProjects/ScatterNetsTestFramework/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/kymatio-0.2.0.dev0-py3.5.egg/kymatio/scattering2d/scattering2d.py", line 235, in call

KeyError: 0

Is it me or something is wrong?
Thank you,
Dmitry

		Hi Dmitry,
Thanks for opening this issue. Indeed, the value J=1 can't work currently. If J=1 is used, then no second-order coefficient will be included. I'm not sure it makes sens to set this value as valid.

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eickenberg&gt;@eickenberg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 any thoughts? Should it be a legal value?

, thank you for the reply
But this is exactly what I'm trying to do here. I only need 1 order of coefficients which then will be worked on and reused.
Is there any hacky way I can enable J=1?

		So, if you impose maxorder=1 and if you modify this line: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/master/kymatio/scattering2d/filter_bank.py#L49&gt;https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio/blob/master/kymatio/scattering2d/filter_bank.py#L49&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 such that the resolution 0 of the filterbank is built, then that should work.

		Actually, after looking more carefully, nothing forbids to do J=1 there. Feel free to propose a PR!
