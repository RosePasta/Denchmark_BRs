	<summary>TST Codecov isn't reporting coverage right</summary>
	<description>
For example, it says that no lines in scattering1d.py are ever run:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://codecov.io/gh/kymatio/kymatio/src/master/kymatio/scattering1d/scattering1d.py&gt;https://codecov.io/gh/kymatio/kymatio/src/master/kymatio/scattering1d/scattering1d.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In fact, the only code it claims runs are the test functions. Is there some issue with how we're importing the classes that are preventing the code from being registered as run?
