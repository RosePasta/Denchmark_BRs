	<summary>Application of frame diffs in State is broken</summary>
	<description>

 in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraft/pull/214&gt;#214&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you removed code in  with a comment stating that this would fix loading of units in replayer (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TorchCraft/TorchCraft/commit/9a3f6772bbe7521a6fdab61d47c9915d0f861042&gt;9a3f677&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). However, this breaks client-server communication since State tries to apply the frame diff in place (that's why we added the  in the first place). What failures did you observe exactly when testing this on dumped replays?
