	<summary>ImageProjectiveTransform should be named ImageProjectiveTransformV2</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug

It looks like ImageProjectiveTransform is based on ImageProjectiveTransformV2 present in tf.contrib in TF-1.x.

Describe the expected behavior

Op names should not colide between 1.x and 2.x environments or saved models won't be shareable across them.

		Links to ops:

tf.contrib.image
tensorflow_addons.image

Looking at code it really seems that the op "ImageProjectiveTransformV2" from tf.contrib.image was renamed to "ImageProjectiveTransform" (which was a name already taken by other op). I guess this was un-intentional or in an attempt to cleanup the names, but in reality it can break moving models across TF-1.x and TF-2.x.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andresusanopinto&gt;@andresusanopinto&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think you are correct that this is a problem even though we don't support 1.x because of saved models.

 Should we maintain all V2 op naming just to be safe?

		Yes-- we continue to support v1 graphdef/ops in v2, so maintaining separate namespaces will help avoid collisions. Eventually, we will be able to prefix op names with appropriate namespaces (ie, tensorflow_addons:OP_NAME), but we don't do that yet.

		Thanks! Adding help wanted, and this bug fix would require reviewing all Ops that we've moved over.

		Looks like there are only three ops in addon so far.
Two match:

AdjustHsvInYiq [contrib | addon]
SkipGramGenerateCandidates [contrib | addon]

As noted, one has a name mismatch:

ImageProjectiveTransformV2 [contrib] became ImageProjectiveTransform [addon]

		Going forward is the right thing to rename addon ImageProjectiveTransform to ImageProjectiveTransformV2?

		I think for now, yes -- that'll make sure that people can use the existing
SavedModels, etc.

For the future, we need to figure out proper namespacing.
