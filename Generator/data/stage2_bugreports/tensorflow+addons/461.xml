	<summary>Setting a custom attention_layer fails with AttentionMechanism without memory</summary>
	<description>
System information

Have I written custom code: Yes
OS Platform and Distribution: Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow installed from: binary
TensorFlow version: 2.0.0rc0
TensorFlow Addons installed from: PyPi
TensorFlow Addons version: 0.5.0.dev20190829
Python version and type: 3.6

Describe the bug
When creating an AttentionMechanism without a memory and then creating an AttentionWrapper with a custom attention_layer, an error is raised.
Describe the expected behavior
No error should be raised.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_addons as tfa

units = 32
attention_mechanism = tfa.seq2seq.LuongAttention(units)
cell = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units)
attention_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(
    units, use_bias=False, activation=tf.math.tanh)
attention_wrapper = tfa.seq2seq.AttentionWrapper(
    cell, attention_mechanism, attention_layer=attention_layer)
Other info / logs
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow_addons/seq2seq/attention_wrapper.py", line 1698, in &lt;genexpr&gt;
    ])[-1]) for layer, mechanism in zip(
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The code tries to compute the attention layer output shape and for that, it uses attention_mechanism.values which is None at the time the AttentionWrapper constructor is called.

 Qianli, could you take a look? Thanks.

		This one is a bit tricky. A possible fix is to lazily compute . However, in the usage introduced by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/354&gt;#354&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it will not work until  is called. We could just raise an exception in that case saying that the user should call this method first.
