	<summary>WeightNormalization data init fails with Keras experimental_run_tf_function</summary>
	<description>
Recent Keras change has made it so the data dependent initialization fails:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;_SymbolicException: Inputs to eager execution function cannot be Keras symbolic tensors, but found [&lt;tf.Tensor 'sequential_1/weight_normalization/mul:0'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm submitting a hotfix which flags the model compile with . Another issue I'm tracking is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/issues/519&gt;tensorflow/probability#519&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to see how TFP resolves their issue.

		This is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/219&gt;#219&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If switching back to , then it works. However, it won't converge.
