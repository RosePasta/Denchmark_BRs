	<summary>Doubt on using tfa.optimizers.MovingAverage</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Colab
TensorFlow version and how it was installed (source or binary): 2.0.0
TensorFlow-Addons version and how it was installed (source or binary): 0.6.0
Python version: 3.6.0
Is GPU used? (yes/no): N/A

Describe the bug
Would you mind clarify how one should use MovingAverage? Possibly, this is not a bug and it's just that I don't know to use it.
This is the way I use it: tfa.optimizers.MovingAverage(tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(0.001)). When running training, it seems no gradient update occurred: loss is at the same value.

You can find my code here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q_Jgkf69dUXhfXli4IXANGjUYdZz2xeU#scrollTo=GEZmiZv56Cen&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Q_Jgkf69dUXhfXli4IXANGjUYdZz2xeU#scrollTo=GEZmiZv56Cen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for raising this issue. It isn't a fault of usage, but a bug in the code due to changes to tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage. I've submitted a PR that should fix this.

 What do you think about the current API for ? Is the  mechanism fine or would you prefer something else?

		I think it's fine.
