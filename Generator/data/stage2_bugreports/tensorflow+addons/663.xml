	<summary>Missing symbol for Abseil ParseTime Op</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Since the 20101030 nightly, our library fails when opening the _parse_time_op.so because of an undefined symbol error. Typically this occurs when there is an ABI incompatibility between core TensorFlow and our custom-ops.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: .../custom_ops/text/_parse_time_op.so: undefined symbol: _ZN4absl9ParseTimeERKSsS1_PNS_4TimeEPSs
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This particular &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/master/tensorflow_addons/custom_ops/text/cc/kernels/parse_time_kernel.cc#L75&gt;custom-op utilizes absl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and the mangled symbol name does not match what our compiled operation thinks it should be. I'm not really sure how this would happen since the rest of the TensorFlow library was compiled with a compatible gcc version.
CC'ing some people who may have insight into how this can happen:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yifeif&gt;@yifeif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/r4nt&gt;@r4nt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/perfinion&gt;@perfinion&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gunan&gt;@gunan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I suppose we could make absl a dependency in our TFA build and compile it ourselves but this seems to be going down a bad path.

 for whether this might be due to us not exporting all symbols from absl any more

		Yep, seems like it is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f58c9f835c32e02895bdd629c7660567ae011001&gt;f58c9f8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which changes what we export, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7362&gt;bazelbuild/bazel#7362&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The absl symbols probably came from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/c3aba0818b6e74ac3a4341d00242c464584c8b50/tensorflow_addons/tensorflow_addons.bzl#L13&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f58c9f835c32e02895bdd629c7660567ae011001&gt;f58c9f8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we just don't export the symbol anymore.
I think the right way forward is to make &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/c3aba0818b6e74ac3a4341d00242c464584c8b50/tensorflow_addons/custom_ops/text/BUILD#L16&gt;_parse_time_op.so&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 depend on absl.

		Great thanks that makes sense! cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/helinwang&gt;@helinwang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as code owner.
Helin if you have time could you submit a patch to add absl as a build dependency.

		After discussion with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/r4nt&gt;@r4nt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it might be better to not pass the absl dependency to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/c3aba0818b6e74ac3a4341d00242c464584c8b50/tensorflow_addons/custom_ops/text/BUILD#L16&gt;_parse_time_op.so&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but rather add  to the  library. (thus make sure that absl symbols are present in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/c3aba0818b6e74ac3a4341d00242c464584c8b50/tensorflow_addons/tensorflow_addons.bzl#L13&gt;@local_config_tf//:libtensorflow_framework&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
The reason for this is, if we pass absl as a dependency, we may end up linking global initializers multiple times.
I can send out a fix for this tomorrow.

		Hmmm so it seems whatever has landed in the tf_nightly-2.1.0.dev20191114 nightly has not fixed this build issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://source.cloud.google.com/results/invocations/f7858a66-3ac1-4717-a85a-bf160e754918/targets/tensorflow_addons%2Fubuntu%2Fcpu%2Fpy3%2Fpresubmit/log&gt;https://source.cloud.google.com/results/invocations/f7858a66-3ac1-4717-a85a-bf160e754918/targets/tensorflow_addons%2Fubuntu%2Fcpu%2Fpy3%2Fpresubmit/log&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I saw there was some issues with merging the patch... can we confirm that the fix landed but didn't solve our issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/scentini&gt;@scentini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Now that the fix has landed do we know if it'll be cherry-picked onto r2.1?

		Unfortunately this fix caused internal breakages, so we'll be rolling it back. Whatever the solution is, it will be cherrypicked onto r2.1. I'll keep you updated.

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ezzeldinadel&gt;@ezzeldinadel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you confirm the nightly version you're using. We've dropped the ParseTime Op until a fix has landed in TF-core so there should be no issue with the nightlies:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KV4J4Gs9VrNmxzstXQOhdYufg1BASaVI&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KV4J4Gs9VrNmxzstXQOhdYufg1BASaVI&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/728&gt;#728&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is passing so I'm assuming this fix landed in nightly. Can we confirm that it was picked into 2.1?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/scentini&gt;@scentini&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so I checked and this build fails on TF2.1rc0 but passes on tf-nightly. Could you point me to the commit that ultimately fixed this so I can request it to be picked into TF2.1? (Assuming that isn't already happening)
