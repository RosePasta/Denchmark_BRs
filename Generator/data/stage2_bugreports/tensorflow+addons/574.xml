		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/npuichigo&gt;@npuichigo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for creating this. I have recently noticed this issue and was going to investigate a little more before posting.
This generally occurs from a mismatch in what compiler version was used between TF and TFA. However, it looks like you built TF from source as well. I'll post any findings in this thread as we work through this.

		So I plan on continuing looking into this (we should be able to match tfa and tf if both are built on the same machine), but wanted to provide a little more information.
The undefined symbol error occurs because of a mismatch in compilers that causes different symbol name managling. This general issue should be solved by this RFC that is already underway:
