	<summary>Generated documentation of type aliases are included in unrelated modules</summary>
	<description>
For example, the documentation of TensorLike is located in tfa.image.color_ops:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/image/color_ops/TensorLike&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/image/color_ops/TensorLike&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Presumably, the system selects the module where the symbol was first found. This is not a big issue but it produces strange and unexpected documentation for type annotations, see for example:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/seq2seq/LuongAttention&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/seq2seq/LuongAttention&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I see 2 possible solutions:

Hide non public symbols in the generated documentation
Properly export type aliases in a public module

		Good catch. I think I'd prefer option 2 since those TensorTypes are pretty important to the end user as it stands today.
