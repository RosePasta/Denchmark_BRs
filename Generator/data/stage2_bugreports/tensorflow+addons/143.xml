Describe the bug
Running ./configure.sh tries to install nightly-2.0-preview that is not available for the mac.
`fluid:tensorflow-addons armando$ ./configure.sh
Collecting tf-nightly-2.0-preview (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tf-nightly-2.0-preview (from -r requirements.txt (line 1)) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for tf-nightly-2.0-preview (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))

		Depends on fixing of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/27470&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#27470&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, works for conda python 3.6

		We currently have no way of providing python 3.7 whl's and are waiting for the new BUILD toolchain (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/issues/119&gt;#119&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )
Once the toolchain is complete... tf-nightly will begin publishing 3.7 wheels and our configure script will work again. Closing as there is nothing we can do here and as of today we do not support python3.7 See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/issues/75&gt;#75&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
