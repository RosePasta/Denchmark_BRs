		Seperately as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/John-8704&gt;@John-8704&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 noted in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/806&gt;#806&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this tutorial doesn't utilize the seq2seq subpackage in TFA. It should be rebuilt to showcase how to use it. If it helps some sample code can be found here:

 I looked into the issue, seems like I didn't add the seq2seq package from TFA, the dataset issue though I think is some kind of an environment refreshing problem cause it is working just fine on my end, I ran it 15-16 times, seems neat.... I was trying to do the tfa.seq2seq but I am running into &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/issues/676&gt;#676&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .. please tell me if there is any way to go about this, meanwhile, I will try other options.
