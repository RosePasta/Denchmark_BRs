	<summary>Got an error very recently for "layers.normalizations". Something related to the "epsilon" variable in the typeguard module.</summary>
	<description>
The code was run in google colab with the following install libraries:
!pip3 install nilearn
!pip3 install simpleITK
!pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==2.1.0
!pip3 install tensorflow-addons==0.8.1

		It was running good previously. Not sure if this is due to a recent update.

		I used a work-around solution by simply downgrading to 0.7.1

Should be a float not integer.

		So isn't it just a change of int to float?


addons/tensorflow_addons/layers/normalizations.py


         Line 78
      in
      343e7f3






 epsilon: int = 1e-3, 




 What's the catch?

The catch is that we incorrectly typed it as an int. If we have casting then we can make it Union[int, float], but otherwise it should be typed as float

		I mean, from a workflow point of view. It's a very simple (even "stylish") modification that could be done in no time without a contributors' help. Sorry, I'm just unfamiliar with practices of this project.

Addons only consists of volunteer contributors ðŸ˜„
Please feel free to submit a PR, as you mentioned its an easy fix... and maintainers need to balance reviews, shepparding issues (like this one) and submitting contirbutions....

		eps should be float only and not int in any case.

Thanks for the fix!! Encouraging others to fix easy issues also helps grow our contributor base.
Any thoughts on adding this to a 0.8.2 patch version? We could also include the fixes to CohensKappa once that merges.

Yes, let's stress test our release process!
Jokes aside, it's a good way to check that the release process is as automatic as possible :)
It would be nice if we had an automatic way of porting bugfix PRs to other branches. I know CPython has a system like that.

		Thank you for all the information. I understand "epsilon" should be a float simply based on it's definition. I was running in google-colab and not quite family with all those function. Thanks again!

 This is fixed in the newly pushed 0.8.2 version
