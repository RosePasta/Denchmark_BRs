		Thanks for the notice, let me take a look for the change in contrib.
As a side note, since addons hasn't been port into google internal yet, eng within google is still using existing contrib version of seq2seq.

		I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8bbc039&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow@8bbc039&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
