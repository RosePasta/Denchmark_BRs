	<summary>Why MovingAverage num_steps takes 'string'?</summary>
	<description>
System information

OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
TensorFlow version and how it was installed (source or binary): TF 2.3.0, binary
TensorFlow-Addons version and how it was installed (source or binary): 0.11.0
Python version: 3.6.8
Is GPU used? (yes/no): yes

Describe the bug
MovingAverage type error seems to be weird.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;type of argument "num_updates" must be one of (str, NoneType); got tensorflow.python.distribute.values.MirroredVariable instead
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Optional[str] is wrong : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/v0.10.0/tensorflow_addons/optimizers/moving_average.py#L50&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/v0.10.0/tensorflow_addons/optimizers/moving_average.py#L50&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Code to reproduce the issue
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;optimizer = tfa.optimizers.SGDW(
            learning_rate=FLAGS.lr, weight_decay=FLAGS.weight_decay, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)
        optimizer = tfa.optimizers.MovingAverage(optimizer, average_decay=0.9999, num_updates=optimizer.iterations)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Other info / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.

		Yeah that's a bug. It should either be a int or a tf.Varaible with correct dtype. Thanks for reporting. Can you please add a PR with the correction?
