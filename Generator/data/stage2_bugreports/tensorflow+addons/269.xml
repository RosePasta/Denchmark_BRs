	<summary>MovingAverage optimizer fails in graph mode</summary>
	<description>
Per today's failing nightly:
ValueError: Inconsistent values for attr 'Tin' [DT_FLOAT, DT_FLOAT] vs. [DT_RESOURCE, DT_FLOAT] while building NodeDef 'cond_dense/kernel/ExponentialMovingAverage' using Op&lt;name=If; signature=cond:Tcond, input: -&gt; output:; attr=Tcond:type; attr=Tin:list(type),min=0; attr=Tout:list(type),min=0; attr=then_branch:func; attr=else_branch:func; attr=output_shapes:list(shape),default=[]; is_stateful=true&gt;
A commit on tensorflow core has made it so that there is a mismatch in attr for variables being created in the ema and what is being passed in. My best guess on the commit is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d1ce3b1791b8447ceeea2d12fa60598701d80b9d&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow@d1ce3b1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 though our current test setup makes it quite difficult to locate the specific commit.

 If you want I can take a look at this. I authored  optimizer.

		Hmmm tests against 2.0.0.dev20190604 are passing. Looks like it's been fixed on TF core. If anyone is able to find the commit I'd be interested.
