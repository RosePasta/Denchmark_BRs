	<summary>Keras object serialization/deserialization is breaking</summary>
	<description>
Since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b22fd65247633edfbc000c3bd9b9008502aedc33#diff-ca2f2579ed6d04b0be9c2bacfa1a4d38&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow@b22fd65#diff-ca2f2579ed6d04b0be9c2bacfa1a4d38&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Certain tests are failing. Need to look into why this is breaking and make sure our object serialization is consistent across the repo.
