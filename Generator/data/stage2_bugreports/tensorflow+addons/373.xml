The CI Build for PY2-GPU failed because of .

		So more info:
Seems not related to py2 vs py3. There has not been a gpu-py34 released since 20190718 so that's why it's passing.
The error is incredibly cryptic when decorated with tf.function... and when I remove that it looks like 2 errors are being raised instead of the one we're catching:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;InvalidArgumentError: input must be at least 3-D, got shape[2,3] [Op:AdjustHsvInYiq]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: Shape must be at least rank 3 but is rank 2 for 'adjust_hsv_in_yiq/AdjustHsvInYiq' (op: 'AdjustHsvInYiq') with input shapes: [2,3], [], [], [].
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have no idea which commit started this and no reason why it's only happening on the GPU pip package.

		It can run in the eager mode but failed in the graph mode. I tried to add the GPU kernel but the build failed. Will update it here if I get any progress.

		For tracking purposes... a temporary fix was put in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/378&gt;#378&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
