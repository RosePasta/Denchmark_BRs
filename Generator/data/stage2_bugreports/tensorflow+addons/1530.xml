	<summary>LAMB optimizer parses regex patterns improperly</summary>
	<description>
The &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/r0.8/tensorflow_addons/optimizers/lamb.py#L45&gt;LAMB optimizer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 declares that its  argument should take in a comma-separated string of regex patterns. However, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/blob/r0.8/tensorflow_addons/optimizers/lamb.py#L234&gt;the code expects a list of regex patterns&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and instead iterates through each character in the string. Thus nearly every call to  returns False.
I attempted to pass in a list to circumvent this bug, but this leads to a typeguard error. So there's no easy way around this in the meantime. A similar bug exists for exclude_from_layer_adaption.
Two proposed fixes, and I'm happy to contribute either:

Change the desired datatype from Optional[str] to List[str]. This would be preferred, and match the style of other implementations in the TensorFlow repo. See here for a list of examples. My PR is open at #1532.
Add .split(',') to exclude_from_weight_decay and exclude_from_layer_adaption in the constructor.

		This has been fixed and ported to the 0.8.x branch.
