Describe the bug
WeightNormalization layer can't save to h5

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
WeightNormalization causing duplicate names of variables.
Code to reproduce the issue
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_addons as tfa

conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(1, 1, name='conv')
wn_conv = tfa.layers.WeightNormalization(conv)

model = tf.keras.Sequential(layers=[wn_conv])
model.build([1, 2, 3])
print([w.name for w in model.layers[0].weights])
model.save_weights('model.h5')
Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
See above.

		Thanks for reporting &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hankcs&gt;@hankcs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! I'll take a look at this when time allows, but if anyone else is interested in investigating/patching it'd be much appreciated, just post your findings in this issue.
