	<summary>On the usage of ContrastiveLoss</summary>
	<description>
Hi.
I am following this tutorial from the keras.io website: &lt;denchmark-link:https://keras.io/examples/mnist_siamese/&gt;https://keras.io/examples/mnist_siamese/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I am replacing the  as specified there with  and I am not getting consistent results (in particular, the results are random). I think I have matched the requirements of . Here's the &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/gist/sayakpaul/4a5818af29c556a7ee346995de5ebfb3/scratchpad.ipynb&gt;notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that reproduces this issue.
Thanks in advance for your help.

 Thanks for reporting it. That is definitely a random behavior. We will look into it

  I can take a look at this if no one else is already working on it.

 I think this issue may have already been fixed. I was able to replicate the issue using tfa version 0.8.3, as is used in the notebook, or version 0.9.1, the newest version available through pip. Building from the master branch, however, I got the expected behavior. I think it was this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/commit/10f718f9ca3862e56ef3abb5ccb9360372af047a&gt;commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from a little over a week ago that fixed it.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/henry-eigen&gt;@henry-eigen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for looking into it. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sayakpaul&gt;@sayakpaul&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 if you can please confirm this, we will close the issue. I looked into the code as well and on the first look, I didn't find any bug.

		Apologies for the late reply. Seems like the solution for now is to install tfa from source. I will check it and report back accordingly. As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/henry-eigen&gt;@henry-eigen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 already checked it (thanks for that :)) I think we can close the issue.
