	<description>
Thanks for your work!

because i try to install it in windows10,but failed,it need a package named faiss-cpu-1.6.3-py36h6bb024c_0 , but this package only support Linux

		Hi, it's surprising, faiss is not required (you can check the requirements.txt file) and I don't have it installed on Ubuntu or Mac. Can you post a print of the error message?

Thanks for your reply!
I follow your tutorials to install it ,and When I run * poetry install --no-root  \ to verify if i install succeefully,and it get error:
ERROR:root:The testing module requires faiss. You can install the GPU version with the command 'conda install faiss-gpu -c pytorch' or the CPU version with 'conda install faiss-cpu -c pytorch'.

		Alright, that's something else. The ERROR message here is not a concern, it comes from a third party library and some part of their code that is not used here. The reason the tests fails is that it tries to create a model that does not exist (the last line in your screenshot). I think it is something to do with how python handles paths on windows,if you want to take a look, something is going wrong around here:



torch-points3d/torch_points3d/models/model_factory.py


        Lines 32 to 41
      in
      dedeac8






 model_cls = None 



 for name, cls in modellib.__dict__.items(): 



 if name.lower() == class_name.lower(): 



 model_cls = cls 



 



 if model_cls is None: 



 raise NotImplementedError( 



 "In %s.py, there should be a subclass of BaseDataset with class name that matches %s in lowercase." 



 % (model_module, class_name) 



     ) 





model_cls should be something like torch_points3d.models.segmentation.kpconv.something

		I suspect that the kernels did not build. We haven't tried those on Windows
so it could very well be that it does not compile them at all. What does
`pip install torch_points_kernels --no-cache -v` returns? It should compile
the libraries in principle.

yes,may be i dont compile it ,and i download torch_points_kenels and run python setup.py intall to compile it,alseo get the error

		Yes, not very surprising... We don't support windows... If you manage to
fix torch_points_kernels we would welcome a PR!

 pytorch-metric-learning author here. This issue made me realize how confusing the faiss import error is when inside another package. I've made a small change to the imports, so the faiss warning only appears if you explicitly import the testers module or utils.accuracy_calculator. The changes are in pytorch-metric-learning 0.9.87.dev0.
