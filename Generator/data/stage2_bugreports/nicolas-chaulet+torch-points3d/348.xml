I get the following error when running dasboard.ipynb in jupyter lab

All modules imported successfully. model_path seems to stay as it was initialized: 'None', should that be the case?

		That's not correct no... We haven't been using those in a while. Have you run the following command before running the notebook?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Yes, I ran that command before running the notebook.
It seems to be because I have nothing in the viz folder for the one run that I have from training votenet for object detection on scannet. How do I generate the visualizations for this?

Iâ€˜ve got the same problem, did u get any hint to solve this problem?

		Ok, makes sense now. The visualisation dashboard is only working for a few specific models on segmentation tasks (I think pointnet++ and maybe kpconv). If you want to visualise the output I would suggest that you implement a notebook from scratch and save the output after each epoch. You can take a look at what we did for PointGroup:


And the notebook:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/notebooks/pointgroup_debug.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/notebooks/pointgroup_debug.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can probably also reuse this notebook to explore the visuals:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/notebooks/scannet_object_explorer.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d/blob/master/notebooks/scannet_object_explorer.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Does that help?

		Yes, that's helpful. It will probably be a while before I get to that stage with my own custom model but it looks to be clear what needs to be done for creating custom visualizations, Thanks.
