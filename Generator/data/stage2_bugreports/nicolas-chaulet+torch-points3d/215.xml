	<summary>problem in compute_sparse_delta</summary>
	<description>
I think there is a problem &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/deeppointcloud-benchmarks/blob/2cd595d5c10cb26674755e4e462fb5f546c449a5/src/core/data_transform/sparse_transforms.py#L87&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Indeed, we are computing the difference between raw_pos(which is xyz coordinate) and data.pos which is now voxel coordinate. Therefore, the operation is not homogeneous.
