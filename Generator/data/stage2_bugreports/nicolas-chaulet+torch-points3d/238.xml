	<summary>model checkpoint with custom  evaluation metrics</summary>
	<description>
There is a problem with model checkpoint:. If we have metrics that doesn't belong to  DEFAULT_METRICS_FUNC it raises an Exception. Maybe it should be a parameter of the tracker, In the tracker itself, we define this dictionary metric_func.
What do you think ?
