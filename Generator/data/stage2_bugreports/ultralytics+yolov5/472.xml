 hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a fresh git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov5  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 &amp;&amp; cd yolov5 # clone latest
python detect.py  # verify detection
python train.py  # verify training (a few batches only)
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for guidelines on training your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.
Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in our Google Cloud VM or Jupyter Notebook we can not debug it. Ensure you meet the requirements specified in the README: Unix, MacOS, or Windows with Python &gt;= 3.7, PyTorch &gt;= 1.5 etc. You can also use our Jupyter Notebook  and our Docker Image  to test your code in a working environment.

If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

 it appears you have environment problems. In order to run YOLOv5 correctly your environment must meet  the minimum version requirements for the dependencies described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#requirements&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#requirements&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. You can either update your local environment to bring it into compliance or you can use one of our verified environment options below.
