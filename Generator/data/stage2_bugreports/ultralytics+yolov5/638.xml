when I load the “yolov5s.torchscript.pt“”，it has no problem， but when I execute the following statement：
at::Tensor output = module.forward(inputs).toTensor();
it appeared the flowing error：
There is an unhandled exception at 0x00007FFB159FA799 (located in ConsoleApplication9.exe): Microsoft C++ exception: c10::Error, located at memory location 0x0000003EFB31FB70
but I use the other modes such as resnet_mode.pt , it has no error when run
my pytorch version is torch-1.6.0+cu101-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64
VS is 2019, sdk is10.0.17763.0

		yolov5s.torchscript.pt output is not a tensor, but a list. You can use list type to obtain the results, such as:
auto  output = module.forward(inputs);
for(int i=0; i&lt;output.size(); i++){at::Tensor result = output.get(i).toTensor();}
If this helps.
