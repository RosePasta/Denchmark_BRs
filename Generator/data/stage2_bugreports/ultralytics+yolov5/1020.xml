	<summary>There seems to be a bug in the Mosaic data augmentation?</summary>
	<description>
I visualized the Mosaic data augmentation and found that some of the labels wrong shifted after the data augmentation. After debugging, I find there seems to be a problem with this line of the load_mosaic function:
x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = w - (x2a - x1a), 0, max(xc, w), min(y2a - y1a, h)
the line 664 of dataset.py, I want to ask if this line should be changed:
x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = w - (x2a - x1a), 0, w, min(y2a - y1a, h)
because in the bottom left patch of mosaic image, the xmax point of source image shouldn't be changed.
Hope you can reply me soon, thank you.

@yuefanhao
I also found this problem, but it has no effect.

But it will create wrong label shift when I visualized the mosaic image with my own datasets, have you visualized the mosaic image?

		I used yolov5 to train my own data set and found no abnormalities. But when I studied mosaic code, I found this error by reasoning, but it didn't affect the image.
For example: a=np.ones([10,10,3]), a[:10] and a[:14] are equivalent.

 thanks for the bug report! Can you show an image of the mislabelled instances?
Would you like to submit a PR for this change?
