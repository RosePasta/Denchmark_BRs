	<summary>A request about the coco test2017 dataset labels.</summary>
	<description>
Hi, YOLOv5 team,
It's such a wonderful work you've done. I tried to modify the YOLO based on your architecture. However, it seems that you only provide processed labels of the val2017 dataset but no test2017 labels. Though your tutorials said we can download the labels by calling "gdrive_download('1cXZR_ckHki6nddOmcysCuuJFM--T-Q6L','coco2017labels.zip')  # annotations", no test2017 labels were found.
Can you please give us a link to download the test2017 labels so that we can test the performance on our own. Great Thanks.

		See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/scripts/get_coco.sh&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/scripts/get_coco.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You simply uncomment the test line to also download the test set.
