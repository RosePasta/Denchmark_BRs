	<summary>"__getitem__" in LoadImagesAndLabels class</summary>
	<description>
Hi, YOLOv5 team, I found something weird and unreasonable in the definition of getitem in LoadImagesAndLabels class. Though it's a tiny mistake, I suppose you can mix it and make the code better. The question is that once I turned image_weights=True, the model couldn't be trained as expected.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following part does not work, since "self.indices" is not defined previously.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    if self.image_weights:
        index = self.indices[index]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Input:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;image_weights=True
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AttributeError: 'LoadImagesAndLabels' object has no attribute 'indices'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Can we delete these codes immediately or please assign some values to 'indices'?

 thanks for the bug report. An argparser argument for enabling weighted image training appears to have been accidentally deleted in a past PR. Commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/commit/69ff781ca5fa995ce2eeae215a486ab9f7ff566c&gt;69ff781&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should resolve this (DDP section may need rework). Please git pull and try again. To enable weighted image training:
python train.py --img-weights 
This will select image for training according to their image weights rather than randomly or sequentially selecting them in the dataloader. Image weights are computed as the inverse mAPs of the labelled objects they contain. mAPs obtained from previous epoch's testing. The intended effect is selection more often for images containing problematic classes.
