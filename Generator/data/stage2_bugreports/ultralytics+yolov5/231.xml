	<summary>Docker Images Require Unreleased Linux Drivers</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

CUDA acceleration is not available when using the Docker images as the Dockerfile was updated to use 20.06-py3, which relies on Nvidia Drivers that not past release candidate/ beta stage.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Attempt to start Docker image and you will see errors on platform support and how only CPU will be supported
Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: This container was built for NVIDIA Driver Release 450.36 or later, but
       version 440.100 was detected and compatibility mode is UNAVAILABLE.
       [[CUDA Driver UNAVAILABLE (cuInit(0) returned 804)]]
NOTE: MOFED driver for multi-node communication was not detected.
      Multi-node communication performance may be reduced.
Using CPU
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

GPU Acceleration is available on a stable channel released driver.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

OS: Ubuntu 18.04 host
GPU Quadro P2000

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Do we need any of the capabilities provided in the latest image or can we revert to the previous one, which depends on the latest stable driver release?

 thanks for the feedback! The 20.06 image was tested on a GCP VM without issue. Just in case though we've reverted the yolov5:latest image to 20.03. You should be able to pull this image now.

		I also have this problem with Nvidia driver release 440.100 which is the default driver provided by ubuntu-desktop-20.04.
