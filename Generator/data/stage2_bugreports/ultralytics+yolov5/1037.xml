	<summary>problem resuming training</summary>
	<description>
I used the command python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 20 --data ./data/my_data.yaml --cfg ./models/yolov5s.yaml --resume ./runs/exp1/weights/last.pt to resume training from last saved checkpoint. However, it shows

Transferred 370/370 items from yolov5s.pt

and starting training from epoch 0.
The yolov5 version used is v3.0 and downloaded full zip on 2020-09-24
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    # Resume
    if opt.resume:
        last = get_latest_run() if opt.resume == 'get_last' else opt.resume  # resume from most recent run
        if last and not opt.weights:
            logger.info(f'Resuming training from {last}')
        opt.weights = last if opt.resume and not opt.weights else opt.weights
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Checked on this snippet, the variable last is the expected path, however, the opt.weights not changed to the specified path.
Tried to simply delete and not opt.weights, the opt.weights is then changed and the resume process running normally.
Since opt.weight is set to 'yolov5s.pt' as default according to parser.add_argument('--weights', type=str, default='yolov5s.pt', help='initial weights path') , not opt.weights should be always false. Therefore, I don't understand why do we need  and not opt.weights this judgement here for resuming.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/KeCHEN0207&gt;@KeCHEN0207&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , maybe you could update your repo. I just did a quick run on coco128 for resume and it works.
Training: 
Resume: python train.py --resume 
This is all you need now. It should find the latest training. You can also pass a path after resume if you want to resume a specific training.
Current code:



yolov5/train.py


        Lines 418 to 425
      in
      7220cee






 if opt.resume:  # resume an interrupted run 



 ckpt = opt.resume if isinstance(opt.resume, str) else get_latest_run()  # specified or most recent path 



 log_dir = Path(ckpt).parent.parent # runs/exp0 



 assert os.path.isfile(ckpt), 'ERROR: --resume checkpoint does not exist' 



 with open(log_dir / 'opt.yaml') as f: 



 opt = argparse.Namespace(**yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader))  # replace 



 opt.cfg, opt.weights, opt.resume = '', ckpt, True 



 logger.info('Resuming training from %s' % ckpt)
