 we don't have any windows environments so this one is up to you to debug. If you find a solution please submit a PR.

		Incidentally I see you code is out of date. Would suggest using the latest code.

		I ran into this as well. This is because the glob result, d, and the dir use a different seperator on windows. One looks like runs/exp0 and the other like runs\exp0, so they don't match for the .replace() fn.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A quick fix, untested on *nix:
d = d[-1].replace(os.sep, '/').replace(dir, '')

		We want to use pathlib to generate os-agnostic paths whenever necessary. For example:



yolov5/utils/datasets.py


        Lines 69 to 71
      in
      611ec44






 class LoadImages:  # for inference 



 def __init__(self, path, img_size=640): 



 p = str(Path(path))  # os-agnostic

 Agreed, the above was just a rough fix. This is actually same issue that was fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/344&gt;#344&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , but somehow that change isn't currently reflected in , even though it says it was merged. Maybe it was accidentally overwritten later?

		Oh! That’s really strange. I’ll fix.
BTW I think we have another bug. runs/exp refuses to increment past exp10

 ok just pushed a fix &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/commit/98f4a5af8751e6ad41a8d5bcedae6ce5cf911c37&gt;98f4a5a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for this. Can you git pull and try again?

		Do Anyone know if the model or code is out of date then what to do?

 I need a help. It seems my code or model is out of date as you told.
Could you please tell how to resolve it?

 you can either  to update your repo, or you can redownload the zip file and transfer your existing runs directory to the new version. The first is preferred, when possible.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher&gt;@glenn-jocher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fix works. Also tested to exp12 with no issues. Only small "bug" is that the folders are shown higher up in the file hierarchy system since they start with a one, so it goes
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;runs
---exp0
---exp1
---exp10
---exp11
---exp12
---exp2
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Could probably fix this by forcing string format to either two or three digits before the decimal place in the return statement of increment_dir()

 ah, good point, but I think the presented order is os-specific, so not our department.
