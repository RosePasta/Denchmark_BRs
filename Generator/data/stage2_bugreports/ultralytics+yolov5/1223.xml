&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Inference stops on last frame after sometime and new frames are not inferred. I started python detect.py --classes 0 on IP-Camera
and noticed that it is stacked on last frame after 2- 3 hours also there is no exception nor any crush to app

		Hello, thank you for your interest in our work! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a new git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov5  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 &amp;&amp; cd yolov5 # clone latest
python detect.py  # verify detection
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE


Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO or COCO128 data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for guidelines on training your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.


Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in one of the verified environments below we can not debug it. If you are running YOLOv5 locally, ensure your environment meets all of the requirements.txt dependencies specified below.


If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
