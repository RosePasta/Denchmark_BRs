	<description>
hello, last month i clone this repo, and can train successfully, but i reclone this repository, then run :
nohup python3 train.py --data data/data.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --img 640 --batch-size 64 &amp;
got error :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "train.py", line 491, in &lt;module&gt;
    train(hyp, opt, device, tb_writer, wandb)
  File "train.py", line 186, in train
    mlc = np.concatenate(dataset.labels, 0)[:, 0].max()  # max label class
  File "&lt;__array_function__ internals&gt;", line 6, in concatenate
ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 114824 has 1 dimension(s)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

why i got this ? any suggest ? thank you

		Hello, thank you for your interest in YOLOv5! This issue seems to lack the minimum requirements for a proper response, or is insufficiently detailed for us to help you. Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your modified or out-of-date code. If your issue is not reproducible in a new git clone version of this repo we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and verify your issue persists:

$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 yolov5_new  # clone latest
$ cd yolov5_new
$ python detect.py  # verify detection

# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE


Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible in one of our 3 common datasets (COCO, COCO128, or VOC) we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for guidelines on training your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of your labels and images.


Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in one of the verified environments below we can not debug it. If you are running YOLOv5 locally, verify your environment meets all of the requirements.txt dependencies specified below. If in doubt, download Python 3.8.0 from https://www.python.org/, create a new venv, and then install requirements.


If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

		I have tried it now and the same issue exists except the index has changed from 114824 to 42. The error looks like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Optimizer groups: 76 .bias, 76 conv.weight, 73 other
Scanning '../coco/labels/train2017.cache' for images and labels... 117266 found, 1021 missing, 0 empty, 0 corrupted: 100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 118286/118286 [00:00&lt;?, ?it/s]

  File "train.py", line 191, in train
    mlc = np.concatenate(dataset.labels, 0)[:, 0].max()  # max label class
  File "&lt;__array_function__ internals&gt;", line 5, in concatenate
ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 42 has 1 dimension(s)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Interesting thing is that the code runs without this issue when I run it with coco128.yaml.

 if you were getting this error before, then you may have a corrupted cache that is not being replaced. Please delete any *.cache files in your datasets and try again.

		Completely forgot about the cache, this solves the issue. Thanks.

 normally the cache is automatically deleted and rewritten if needed (i.e. if the dataset changes), but this special case (the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/1513&gt;#1513&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 bug) would require the cache to be manually deleted unfortunately. Maybe I should have baked in some more checks into the code... but anyway yes if anyone still has problems deleting the *.cache file in your dataset should clear the problem.
