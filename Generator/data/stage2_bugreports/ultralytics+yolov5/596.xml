	<summary>Failure to train</summary>
	<description>
Rerunning a training run that worked previously and get the following after train.py checks out all the inputs........
Image sizes 416 train, 416 test
Using 2 dataloader workers
Starting training for 250 epochs...
Epoch   gpu_mem      GIoU       obj       cls     total   targets  img_size

However also getting:
Setup complete. Using torch 1.6.0+cu101 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='Tesla T4', major=7, minor=5, total_memory=15079MB, multi_processor_count=40)
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/torch/cuda/.py:125: UserWarning:
Tesla T4 with CUDA capability sm_75 is not compatible with the current PyTorch installation.
The current PyTorch install supports CUDA capabilities sm_37 sm_50 sm_60 sm_70.
If you want to use the Tesla T4 GPU with PyTorch, please check the instructions at &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&gt;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

warnings.warn(incompatible_device_warn.format(device_name, capability, " ".join(arch_list), device_name))
So could be related the hardware Colab is supplying me with?
Not sure how much I can help as it is well above my pay grade :)
