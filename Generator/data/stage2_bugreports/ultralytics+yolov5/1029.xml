	<summary>Passing --img-size [train_size, test_size]</summary>
	<description>
Hi!
I have tried every variation of passing --img-size [train_size, test_size] but get:
train.py: error: argument --img-size: invalid int value: "['640', '640']"
I want to train on one sized image and test on another to compare this to training on full sized images.

 , I think you pass like this   You separate by space.
