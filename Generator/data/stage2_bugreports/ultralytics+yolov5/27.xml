 I've not seen this error before, so I'm sorry but I don't think I can help you.
I might recommend training in a common environment, such as our docker container to avoid any potential environment issues. For example environments see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
