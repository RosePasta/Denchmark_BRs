	<summary>V 3.0 tag pointing to wrong commit</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The 3.0 release is pointing to commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/commit/1ddf692bf89ac47d5e2dc8333cd0f4f145bb7f61&gt;1ddf692&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which is one commit before the actual v3.0 release, so if someone clones the repo from the v3.0 version is actually using the older version.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Click on the tag commit.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It should point towards commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/commit/916d4aad9a154587dc5914f9b04be575a0990529&gt;916d4aa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 thanks, it looks like you are right. Unfortunately I'm unable to change the commit associated with the release after publishing it, and it seems like I can only issue a new release associated with recent commits (i.e. within the last 10 commits). I'm not sure there's anything I can do about this now.

		Something like this?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.community/t/create-releases-for-old-commits/872&gt;https://github.community/t/create-releases-for-old-commits/872&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I tried it but it was too complicated, will take better care going forward for next release.

		This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
