	<summary>"test_batch0_gt.jpg" is not seen after training</summary>
	<description>
I run the training using yolov5 and when epoch0 is done I got "test_batch0_pred.jpg" and "test_batch0_labels.jpg". Did not see "test_batch0_gt.jpg" documented in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Is it a typo or bug? Thanks.

 ah yes you are correct! We did a recent PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/1337&gt;#1337&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to replace 'gt' with 'labels' throughout the code, but we forgot to update the tutorial with the change. Thanks for spotting!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher&gt;@glenn-jocher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I run training in my custom dataset and found the "test_batch0_labels.jpg" do not display the right groundtruth, just as following:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7008933/99223954-68f6c780-2820-11eb-9770-67e55808e9ec.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And the test results seemed not right. So I doubt if the testloader has a bug?
I packed my data and yaml file here.
&lt;denchmark-link:http://alg-misc.cn-hangzhou.oss.aliyun-inc.com/sanjie.lp/data4glenn.tar.gz?OSSAccessKeyId=LTAIpW2IslzIn6SX&amp;Expires=1609111676&amp;Signature=tNiiceYyOvYt%2BsU7rkdcBGlL8oQ%3D&gt;http://alg-misc.cn-hangzhou.oss.aliyun-inc.com/sanjie.lp/data4glenn.tar.gz?OSSAccessKeyId=LTAIpW2IslzIn6SX&amp;Expires=1609111676&amp;Signature=tNiiceYyOvYt%2BsU7rkdcBGlL8oQ%3D&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I run the command "python train.py --img 640 --batch 48 --epochs 140 --data person-wide-1c.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt". If I don't use yolov5 right, please let me know and thank you.

 the repo operates correctly, the source of error is the labels you have supplied. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&gt;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I carefully checked my data and labels and can make sure that they are right and one to one correspondences. Could you please help me see the dataset? Thanks.

 you are seeing the dataset in the image you uploaded. Your labels are not correct.

 Yes, that is what I am confused with. The labels of dataset I used are correct and I do not know why they are not displayed correctly.

 they are displayed exactly the way they should be displayed. Your underlying data is being displayed correctly. You draw the conclusion.

 I think I am sure that the labels I provided are not like the way they are displayed. Firstly the box numbers are not correct, let alone the box locations. Let me give you some examples.
The left bottom image in the "test_batch0_labels.jpg" is "kitti_kitti_train_006825.jpg", and there are 3 boxes displayed(what you can see from that image). But its label I provide is like this(only 2 boxes):
0	0.364371980676	0.539541547278	0.0182769726248	0.0916905444128
0	0.34847020934	0.53553008596	0.0202898550725	0.096848137536
The left top image in the "test_batch0_labels.jpg" is "coco_000000290623.jpg", and there is only 1 box displayed there. But its label I provied is like this (2 boxes):
0 0.67796875 0.348011363636 0.1640625 0.4125
0 0.31234375 0.222869318182 0.06 0.216193181818

		But what confused me more is botth "test_batch0_pred.jpg" and "train_batch*.jpg" seem correct. It indicates the training routine and label loading are both normal. So I wonder if the labels loading in the test routine is with bug. I hope I am wrong and just I use yolov5 by a wrong way.

 if you believe there is a bug then please raise a new bug report issue, and most importantly please provide a reproducible example, i.e. a colab notebook that reproduces the error. Here are the bug report details:
Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your modified or out-of-date code. If your issue is not reproducible in a new git clone version of this repo we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and verify your issue persists:

$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 yolov5_new  # clone latest
$ cd yolov5_new
$ python detect.py  # verify detection

# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE


Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible in one of our 3 common datasets (COCO, COCO128, or VOC) we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for guidelines on training your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of your labels and images.


Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in one of the verified environments below we can not debug it. If you are running YOLOv5 locally, verify your environment meets all of the requirements.txt dependencies specified below. If in doubt, download Python 3.8.0 from https://www.python.org/, create a new venv, and then install requirements.


If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

 Sorry, I found out it is because I modified the labels wrongly in the process of training. Now it is running normally. Thanks anyway!
