	<summary>Train and Test Batch images not being produced today?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I was running custom data and notebook and my batch images stopped running and was giving me errors. I figured it was something I did, but then I opened your colabs tutorial and tried to run that and I'm seeing the same thing happen. Maybe this is all me but I cannot get train* jpgs to work for any test.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is what I'm running after training in my custom notebooks which have been running for weeks and in tutorial that you created.
Image(filename='./train_batch1.jpg', width=900)  # view augmented training mosaics
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
Output:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FileNotFoundError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-10-bf672b25fc38&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 Image(filename='./train_batch1.jpg', width=900)  # view augmented training mosaics

3 frames
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/IPython/core/display.py in reload(self)
    629         """Reload the raw data from file or URL."""
    630         if self.filename is not None:
--&gt; 631             with open(self.filename, self._read_flags) as f:
    632                 self.data = f.read()
    633         elif self.url is not None:

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './train_batch1.jpg'


## Expected behavior
Expecting to see images or files in my directory but they are not there. 

## Environment
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

 thank you, yes we have a current bug in the notebooks due to a recent PR. The good news is things are a bit more organized now, so your train*.jpg and all associated training images, weights, results etc are grouped into their own runs/experiment folder.
TLDR, will fix notebook tutorials soon, your training images etc are all now located in runs/exp0, runs/exp1, etc.
