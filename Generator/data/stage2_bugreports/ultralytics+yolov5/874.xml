I was trying this &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb&gt;notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on Microsoft Azure notebook instead of colab but got this error!!

 pycocotools problem in your environment.
it appears you may have environment problems. Please ensure you meet all dependency requirements if you are attempting to run YOLOv5 locally.  If in doubt, create a new virtual Python 3.8 environment, clone the latest repo (code changes daily), and pip install -r requirements.txt again. We also highly recommend using one of our verified environments below.
