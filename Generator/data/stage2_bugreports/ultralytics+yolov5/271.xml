	<summary>train_batch*.jpg error</summary>
	<description>
When  training my own dataset, I found that gt boxes didn't match labels.

if added "--rect" when training my own dataset, train_batch*.jpg were correct. I don't know why this happened? I have the same problem in yolov3. And I found if used the yolov3 from three months ago, there are no problems.

 did you get this resolved? This may occur if you have extra images in your images folder or if you change your data after it has been cached into *.npy files. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/306&gt;#306&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
