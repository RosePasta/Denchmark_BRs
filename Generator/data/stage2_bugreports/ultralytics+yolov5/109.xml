	<summary>Jetson nano (on Jetpack 4.4) - freeze</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I had configured fixed all the output errors from Jetson nano running Jetpack 4.4
However, when I tried to run the following command:
python3 detect.py --source ./inference/images/ --weights ./weights/yolov5s.pt --conf 0.4
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;The jetson nano output the following and freezed.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Namespace(agnostic_nms=False, augment=False, classes=None, conf_thres=0.4, device='', fourcc='mp4v', half=False, img_size=640, iou_thres=0.5, output='inference/output', save_txt=False, source='./inference/images/', view_img=False, weights='./weights/yolov5s.pt')
Using CUDA device0 _CudaDeviceProperties(name='NVIDIA Tegra X1', total_memory=3956MB)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Additional installations required to fix Jetson errors are below:
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;for OSError: libmpi_cxx.so.20&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;ImportError: libopenblas.so.0&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
pip3 install Pillow==2.2.2
sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install torchvision
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is there is anything wrong on the configuration? Can anyone able to run Yolov5 on Jetson Nano (with Jetpack 4.4) successfully? Hope can shared the additional installation and configuration here.
Thanks.

Hi.I implement it in jetson nano but I don't have your problem. I have another.
pip3 install matplotlib doesn't work for me.

		hi.
how did you install libraries? did you install all of them?

		i was sucessfully run on jetson nano, i got around 4-10fps depending on how many bounding boxes present in the frame, setup i just did only build pytorch 1.5 manually from sources and install its prerequisites.

 I am working on a lightweight TensorRT and Numpy implementation for inference on Jetson Nano. If useful, you can find the repo here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SeanAvery/yolov5-tensorrt&gt;https://github.com/SeanAvery/yolov5-tensorrt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
