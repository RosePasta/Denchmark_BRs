&lt;denchmark-code&gt;utils/utils.py", line 470, in compute_loss
    pxy = ps[:, :2].sigmoid() * 2. - 0.5
IndexError: too many indices for tensor of dimension 1

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Pull the latest code, training wrong, what could be the reason?

		I don't know, doesn't look familiar. v2.0 includes breaking changes to the model formats, so make sure you are starting from the current model.yaml and downloading current pretrained weights (both are new).

		i got this error too...
Guess it might be caused by latest commit?

 I'll paste you our default reply here, but in general this is likely caused by using old code or models. I would delete both and start from a clean slate. I'm not aware of any bugs in the current code.
Please note that most technical problems are due to:

Your changes to the default repository. If your issue is not reproducible in a new git clone version of this repository we can not debug it. Before going further run this code and ensure your issue persists:

sudo rm -rf yolov5  # remove existing
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 &amp;&amp; cd yolov5 # clone latest
python detect.py  # verify detection
# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE


Your custom data. If your issue is not reproducible with COCO or COCO128 data we can not debug it. Visit our Custom Training Tutorial for guidelines on training your custom data. Examine train_batch0.jpg and test_batch0.jpg for a sanity check of training and testing data.


Your environment. If your issue is not reproducible in one of the verified environments below we can not debug it. If you are running YOLOv5 locally, ensure your environment meets all of the requirements.txt dependencies specified below.


If none of these apply to you, we suggest you close this issue and raise a new one using the Bug Report template, providing screenshots and minimum viable code to reproduce your issue. Thank you!

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher&gt;@glenn-jocher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 i found that i replace the model file with my modified version.
My mistake.
Thanks very much for your help.
