	<summary>Bug when Installing requirement.txt and apex on CoLab</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
When I install the requirement.txt follow by apex.
The apex is failed to be installed and the cuda cannot be used.
But when I comment the torch&gt;=1.5.1 and torchvision&gt;=0.6, it works again.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

!pip install -U -r requirements.txt
!git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex &amp;&amp; cd apex &amp;&amp; pip install -v --no-cache-dir --global-option="--cpp_ext" --global-option="--cuda_ext" . --user &amp;&amp; cd .. &amp;&amp; rm -rf apex

 apex is no longer used. Do not install it.
Make sure you are meeting the requirements.txt dependencies, which include torch&gt;=1.6.
