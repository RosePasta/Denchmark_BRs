	<summary>Loading yoloV5 pytorch model in OpenCV throws exception</summary>
	<description>
Before submitting a bug report, please be aware that your issue must be reproducible with all of the following, otherwise it is non-actionable, and we can not help you:

Current repo: run git fetch &amp;&amp; git status -uno to check and git pull to update repo
Common dataset: coco.yaml or coco128.yaml
Common environment: Colab, Google Cloud, or Docker image. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#environments

If this is a custom dataset/training question you must include your train*.jpg, test*.jpg and results.png figures, or we can not help you. You can generate these with utils.plot_results().
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;To Reproduce (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Input:
yoloV5 pt file from training
OpenCV (4.2.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0)
#include &lt;opencv2/core/core.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2/dnn/dnn.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp&gt;
cv::String modelWeights = "yolov5s.pt";
cv::dnn::Net net = cv::dnn::readNetFromTorch(modelWeights);
Output:
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Net object is created normally from the weights file.  This call throws an exception.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I know one might say this is an OpenCV bug, not a YoloV5/PyTorch bug, but it may be due to the fact that certain YoloV5 Torch layers are not yet supported in OpenCV DNN API.  My question is, has anyone tried loading their YoloV5 trained models in OpenCV using the DNN API?
Thanks,
Rob

		Upon further reading, I see that OpenCV DNN API readNetFromTorch() only takes files of the original torch7 format, not the pytorch (pt) format.  Not sure how compatible these are, but I believe this is the core issue.
