	<summary>Error in training my data</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;❔Question&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;I have a single target dataset，There's no problem training on yolov3，But there was an error on V5，
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When I use GPU, the train is ok, but An error occurred while testing as follows：
“File "/root/yolov5/utils/general.py", line 365, in bbox_iou
inter = (torch.min(b1_x2, b2_x2) - torch.max(b1_x1, b2_x1)).clamp(0) * 
RuntimeError: CUDA error: device-side assert triggered
/pytorch/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/IndexKernel.cu:84: operator(): block: [4,0,0], thread: [70,0,0] Assertion index &gt;= -sizes[i] &amp;&amp; index &lt; sizes[i] &amp;&amp; "index out of bounds" failed.
I switch to CPU   The error is as follows：
File "/root/yolov5/test.py", line 121, in test
loss += compute_loss([x.float() for x in train_out], targets, model)[1][:3]  # box, obj, cls
File "/root/yolov5/utils/general.py", line 509, in compute_loss
ps = pi[b, a, gj, gi]  # prediction subset corresponding to targets
IndexError: index 52 is out of bounds for dimension 3 with size 52
I checked my dataset and there was nothing wrong and it can be trained and tested on yolov3
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 thanks for the bug report! Can you supply code to reproduce this in a Colab Notebook please? You can use this cell to get started:
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone repo
%cd yolov5
%pip install -qr requirements.txt  # install dependencies

import torch
from IPython.display import Image, clear_output  # to display images

clear_output()
print('Setup complete. Using torch %s %s' % (torch.__version__, torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CPU'))

# CODE TO REPRODUCE YOUR ISSUE HERE

 we are tracking an identical error by another user in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/1551&gt;ultralytics/yolov3#1551&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 interestingly enough.
It seems like in extremely rare cases, when training with mixed precision the index values here may experience overflow.

 this issue should be resolved now in PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/1313&gt;#1313&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Please git pull to receive this update and retrain to verify the issue is resolved.

 thanks! Is this the same identical error as before or a new one? Can you run this in CPU mode to see what the error is again?

 I'm a bit confused about your error messages as the CUDA errors seem to originate in bbox_iou(), but the CPU errors occur before that on L509 .
The PR should fix gj and gi from from over or underflowing, but this would seem to be unrelated to anything is bbox_iou().

		Wait a minute. I'm running on the CPU. It's going to take a while

 hmm ok, thanks. Can you then provide code we can run to reproduce the same error? This Colab cell can get you started.
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone repo
%cd yolov5
%pip install -qr requirements.txt  # install dependencies

import torch
from IPython.display import Image, clear_output  # to display images

clear_output()
print('Setup complete. Using torch %s %s' % (torch.__version__, torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CPU'))

		I didn't modify the code of the project, just added / modified the necessary configuration file according to the prompt. I will carefully check the data set problem tomorrow

		Another question, how can I disable the mixed precision training option in the project to verify that the previous bug is caused by this

 got it. If the dataset is small can you share it and I'll try the training in Colab?

 I think I just realized what the problem is. The PR clamps input indices to the grid size (i.e. 52 in your error), whereas I should have clamped to grid size - 1, which would be 51.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ming-Y-ANG&gt;@Ming-Y-ANG&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ok, I've pushed a second PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/1316&gt;#1316&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which should finally address the overflow issue. Can you git pull and retest?
