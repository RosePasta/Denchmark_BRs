	<summary>best.pt not saved when it is from the last epoch</summary>
	<description>
Before submitting a bug report, please be aware that your issue must be reproducible with all of the following, otherwise it is non-actionable, and we can not help you:

Current repo: run git fetch &amp;&amp; git status -uno to check and git pull to update repo
Common dataset: coco.yaml or coco128.yaml
Common environment: Colab, Google Cloud, or Docker image. See https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#reproduce-our-environment

If this is a custom dataset/training question you must include your train*.jpg, test*.jpg and results.png figures, or we can not help you. You can generate these with utils.plot_results().
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

in train.py line: 390
```
if (best_fitness == fi) and not final_epoch:  ###
torch.save(ckpt, best)
del ckpt
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;when the last epoch happens to have a best fitness,  it wouldn't save a best.pt,
the code outside the train.py cannot judge which .pt  is the best.  


## To Reproduce (REQUIRED)

train one epoch from an interrupted traning's  last.pt , or the best result happens to be in the last epoch.

Output:
"couldn't find best.pt" or load a wrong best.pt. (should be last.pt in this situation)

## Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
when training compeletes, one can load best.pt as it is the best result.


## Environment
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

 - OS: [e.g. Ubuntu]
 - GPU [e.g. 2080 Ti]


## Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
