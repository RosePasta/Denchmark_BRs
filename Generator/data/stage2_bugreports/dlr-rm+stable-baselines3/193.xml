	<summary>[bug] Agent uses GPU even with `device="cpu"` argument.</summary>
	<description>
Creating agents with device="cpu" still loads CUDA libraries and takes up GPU memory when looking at nvidia-smi:
from stable_baselines3 import PPO # Happens with A2C too
agent = PPO("MlpPolicy", "CartPole-v1", device="cpu")
v0.8.0 is the latest version that does not have this bug.
Versions:

Python 3.6
Pytorch 1.6
