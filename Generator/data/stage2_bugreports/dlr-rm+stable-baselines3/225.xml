	<summary>[Bug] arguments order error in explained_variance()</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
The calculation method of explained variance in the comment is: 1 - Var[y-ypred] / Var[y]. In the scenario of value loss, I think the y_true is return and y_pred is value.
The calculation of explained variance in ppo.py:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/blob/master/stable_baselines3/ppo/ppo.py#L223&gt;https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/blob/master/stable_baselines3/ppo/ppo.py#L223&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;explained_var = explained_variance(self.rollout_buffer.returns.flatten(), self.rollout_buffer.values.flatten())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But the arguments in this function:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/blob/master/stable_baselines3/common/utils.py#L42&gt;https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/blob/master/stable_baselines3/common/utils.py#L42&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def explained_variance(y_pred: np.ndarray, y_true: np.ndarray) -&gt; np.ndarray:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seems the order is not right?
thanks!

		You are right, it seems to be the wrong way around! &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/araffin&gt;@araffin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Can you double-confirm this, as you seem to be one who touched the code last?
In case this is a bug, we need to calls to explained_variance for typos like this.

		Hello,
nice catch ;) (the good news is that this variable is only used for debugging purposes)
We would be happy if you could submit a PR that solves this issue ;)
EDIT: the bug may be present in A2C too

		Yes, it just a little bug. Many thanks for this library, it is very useful and make me learn a lot!
