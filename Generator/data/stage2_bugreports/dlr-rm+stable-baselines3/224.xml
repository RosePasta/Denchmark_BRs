	<summary>[Bug] Step environment that needs reset</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;üêõ Step environment that needs reset&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I train DQN on Pong, and I want to use this trained agent to collect 3000 episodes. Each episode contains 60 timesteps. Every time I start a new episode, I use env.reset().  My code is like this.
env = make_atari_env('PongNoFrameskip-v4', n_envs=1, seed=args.seed)
env = VecFrameStack(env, n_stack=4)
agent = DQN.load(model_path)
episode_count = 3000

for i in range(episode_count)Ôºö
    state = env.reset()
    steps = 0
    while True:
        action, state = model.predict(obs, state=state, deterministic=deterministic)
        obs, _, done, infos = env.step(action)

        # add action and obs to buffer

        steps += 1
        if steps == 60:
            break
When I ran the program for a period of time and collected around 1000 episodes, the program suddenly reported an error like this. It's really confusing, it looks like the env cannot be reset.
Traceback (most recent call last):

		Hello,
The provided code is incomplete and seems wrong.
Please provide a full minimal example and take a look at the doc on how to run the trained agent:
obs = env.reset()
n_episodes = 3000
current_episode = 0
while current_episode &lt; n_episodes:
    action, _ = agent.predict(obs)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    # No need to reset, env is resetted automatically
    if done[0]:
        current_episode += 1
We also provide a  helper that may do the job for you ;) (it will be updated to work with Atari soon in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/pull/220&gt;#220&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )

		If I want to limit each episode to include 60 timesteps. Will this be a problem?
env = make_atari_env('PongNoFrameskip-v4', n_envs=1, seed=args.seed)
env = VecFrameStack(env, n_stack=4)
agent = DQN.load(model_path)
episode_count = 3000

for i in range(episode_count)Ôºö
    state = env.reset()
    steps = 0
    while True:
        action, state = model.predict(obs, state=state, deterministic=deterministic)
        obs, _, done, infos = env.step(action)

        # add action and obs to buffer

        steps += 1
        if steps == 60:
            break

What will be a problem?
This will be a problem if the episode length is less than 60 timesteps, it will throw the error you describe above.
Please take a closer look at the code I provided ;) (it is a bit hard to follow the logic if your snippet)
In you current code it should be if steps == 60 or done[0] to avoid the error.

		If the issue is fixed, then you can close this one ;)
