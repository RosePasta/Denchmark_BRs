	<summary>[Bug] Excluding json or csv formats is ignored by the logger's record function</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When running record("some_log_tag", some_data, exclude=("json", "csv")) the exclude parameter is ignored and some_data is still logged to json and csv.
Code example
The following is a minimal test code snipped that reproduces the bug and could also be used as a basis for an automated regression test
from stable_baselines3.common.logger import make_output_format, read_json


def test_ignore_json_formatter(tmp_path):
    writer = make_output_format("json", tmp_path)
    writer.write(dict(some_tag=42), dict(some_tag=("json")))
    assert read_json(tmp_path / "progress.json").empty
For a real regression test I'd use test parametrization to check all the different format writers in one test, following the pattern of test_logger.py.
System Info
Describe the characteristic of your environment:

Install: pip install -e .[extra] within the source root directory

As already mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/186&gt;#186&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'd be happy to provide a PR with a fix and regression tests. Let me know if there is anything else I should consider, or if I should proceed with a PR.
