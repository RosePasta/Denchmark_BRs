&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Question&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm running a simple code follow the documentation of Stable-Baselines3. But I meet an error. I've searched this error, and I still don't know how to solve it.
The following is a screenshot of the specific situation.
What caused it?

		DQN does not support continuous action spaces, and would not work with Pendulum-v0 environment. See docs on supported environments.

Thanks for your reply!
My code is exactly the same as the sample code in the document, but it can't work properly, which really confuses me.
The link of example is &lt;denchmark-link:https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/dqn.html&gt;https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/dqn.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Ooh good catch! That indeed is wrong and should be CartPole-v0, not Pendulum-v0. A PR that fixes this issue would be welcomed :)
