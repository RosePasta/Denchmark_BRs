	<summary>SB3 doesn't write tensorboard logs</summary>
	<description>
I'm not sure if it is a bug or not, however, when training a model, no tensorboard logs are written. Possibly it is due to my python envrionment (below).  I do see model running (verbose=1) and it is also writing monitor csv file to the same directory defined as tensorboard directory.
Python 3.6.11
torch                              1.6.0+cu101
also installed:
tensorboard                        1.14.0
tensorboardX                       2.0
tensorflow                         1.14.0
tensorflow-estimator               1.14.0
tensorflow-gpu                     1.14.0
