	<summary>[Bug] Separate feature extractor for target network (SAC/TD3)</summary>
	<description>
Same issue as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/pull/132&gt;#132&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but for SAC/TD3.
It would need special treatment as it would be beneficial to still share the feature extractor between actor and critic to speedup things.

		I think the fix here is just remove the feature-extractor parameters from the list of update-able parameters. I can recall reading somewhere in docs that only the policy updates feature extractor, which is then shared with rest of the networks.

		Not sure about the original SAC paper, but iirc in RAD and CURL the gradients are propagated from the critic.
