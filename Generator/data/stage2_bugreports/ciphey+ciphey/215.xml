<bug id='215' author='TheAlcanian' open_date='2020-07-29T12:08:25Z' closed_time='2020-10-16T08:06:12Z'>
	<summary>Deciphering base64-encoded files yield no results when run with -i</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When running Ciphey on a base64-encoded file using the - command-line parameter, Ciphey picks up and decodes the base64-encoded file's contents, and prints the decoded content like normal. When running Ciphey on a base64-encoded file using the -i command-line parameter, Ciphey finds no results.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

What input did you use?
A sample file named test_base64 with the contents dGVzdCBiYXNlNjQgb3V0cHV0Cg==
What flags / arguments did you use?
Command run was ciphey -i test_base64.

Expected behavior
Ciphey decodes the base64, outputs the decoded text and exits normally.
Versions:

OS/Distro: Gentoo Linux
Python version: Python 3.7.8
Ciphey versions: CipheyCore v0.2.4, CipheyDists v0.3.11, Ciphey v5.0.0rc10

		Can you run this with -vv (to give trace logging)?

Decoded, but not output?

		Ciphey seems to be loading the filename itself as the ciphertext, rather than as the input. The -i parameter actually doesn't really do anything atm, so I would omit it.
We are having difficulty reading in files with ciphey (hopefully fixed soon), so the best bet is to use cat &lt;file&gt; | ciphey &lt;flags...&gt; (or type &lt;file&gt; | ciphey &lt;flags...&gt; on windows`) until we get that fixed

		I am closing this issue because it appears to be fixed. I can't reproduce the bug when doing ciphey -f test_base64.txt with test_base64.txt containing dGVzdCBiYXNlNjQgb3V0cHV0Cg==
