	<summary>Missing underscores while decoding a Atbash string.</summary>
	<description>

 Have you read our Wiki page "Common Issues &amp; Their Solutions"?
----&gt;Yes

Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
-----&gt; Underscores are neglected while outputting decoded string which is encoded with atbash cipher.
Plaintext
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ciphey -t "Tizmg_nv_zxxvhh_gl_gsv_nzk_kovzhv"
Result 'Grant me access to the map please' (y/N): y
Format used:
  atbash
  reverse
  atbash
  leet
  atbash
  reverse
Final result: "Grant me access to the map please"

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Version

OS/Distro: [Kali Linux 2019.2]
Python version: [Python 3.7.5rc1]
Ciphey versions: [Version: 5.5.2, Version: 0.3.1, Version: 0.3.26]
Did you use Docker?
-----&gt;No

Verbose Output
[https://gist.github.com/547y4m/bbebeea865dfe7f63f4269466071edef]
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:


What input did you use?
"Tizmg_nv_zxxvhh_gl_gsv_nzk_kovzhv"


What flags / arguments did you use?  (-t)
ciphey -t "Tizmg_nv_zxxvhh_gl_gsv_nzk_kovzhv"


Expected behavior
I expect that output would be with underscores, but they are missing.

		This isn't really a bug. It's a result of the leetspeak decoder and not the atbash decoder. The atbash decoder doesn't get rid of punctuation or special characters. You can test this with
ciphey -t "Tizmg_nv_zxxvhh_gl_gsv_nzk_kovzhv" -C regex -p regex.regex=Grant_me
The leetspeak decoder replaces underscores with spaces because people usually use underscores to represent spaces. I don't see the problem with your example because it does use underscores as spaces in between words.

		I admit it but while testing same with cyberchef  atbash module it outputs with underscores. So, just feeled that it's any kindof bug or something.

		Well, what do you suggest we should change? Is there a situation that you can think of that would actually make this a problem?

		Yes, you should if it can be easily fixed because i don't think that adding underscores requires much manipulation in code. And as a ciphey contributor/lover i would like that it will perform well and beats other competitor.
The situation/scenario happens with me yesterday, that even i get the decoded text but my flag format is wrong and i have to shift on cyberchef from ciphey to get the correct flag which is really disappointing as a ciphey user. Great tools focuses on every small to big errors.

		This problem is because "hello_my_name_is_bee" isn't English unless you take away the underscores. Per &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Common-Issues-&amp;-Their-Solutions#ciphey-runs-forever--cant-decrypt-this-input&gt;our wiki&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this is expected behaviour that will change with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Checkers,-explained#entropy-coming-soon&gt;our new checkers&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
In the first wiki page, I talk about why CyberChef can decode that string and Ciphey can't:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10378052/97300628-a0d8a380-184e-11eb-86a3-198cf9f3ea9b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And in the 2nd wiki page, I describe how we're going to solve the problem of not being able to decode that string:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10378052/97300677-b057ec80-184e-11eb-8a28-b74ab92dfd50.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
