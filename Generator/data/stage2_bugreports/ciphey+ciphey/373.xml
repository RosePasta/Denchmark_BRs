after installing ciphey on macOS 10.15.6 with python3 v3.7.3, I tried to run it and got the following error
Pez-MacBook-Pro:~ pez$ ciphey

		Closing this because you didn't fill out the issue template and this is a duplicate issue. The documentation (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Common-Issues-&amp;-Their-Solutions&gt;https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Common-Issues-&amp;-Their-Solutions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) lists this problem with Mac OS, and the solution is to install Docker and run Ciphey with it.
