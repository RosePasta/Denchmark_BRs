	<summary>Brandon checker fails on small inputs</summary>

Describe the bug
With an input of "Damn, Daniel!" Brandon checker fails.
This is because "Damn" is not in check 1k words, and neither is "Daniel".
The solution to this may be to pass an argument which defaults to using the dictionary checker, which is much slower but provides a 99.4% accuracy compared to 97% accuracy.
