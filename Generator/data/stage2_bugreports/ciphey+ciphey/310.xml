	<description>
Describe the bug
Base62 decoding is not working properly.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

What input did you use?
ciphey -t "126hVJJr0BxMumjWTECjbf0W5wF4DFPXG1NcA"
What flags / arguments did you use?
N/A

Verbose Output
N/A because it silently fails and there's no logging for Base62.
Expected behavior

Versions:

OS/Distro: Windows 10
Python version: Python 3.7.7
Ciphey versions: Ciphey 5.3.1, cipheycore 0.2.9, cipheydists 0.3.20
