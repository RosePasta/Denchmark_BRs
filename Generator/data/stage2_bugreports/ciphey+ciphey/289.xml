	<summary>Ciphey Failed To Crack!</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I tried to decrypt the encoded string with Ciphey, it will try to crack it and in the end, it is unable to crack it and I got the output saying "Failed to crack".
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

What input did you use?
Ans. I'm trying to decode the string "Ecgudfxq_EcGmP". This is the input: "Ecgudfxq_EcGmP"
What flags / arguments did you use?
Ans. I used the "-t" flag/argument. So this is the input command: ciphey -t "Ecgudfxq_EcGmP"


After running Ciphey with  and the result is here in this file:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/files/5121058/trace.log&gt;trace.log&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Expected behavior
The encoded strings seem to be encoded using the substitution type (caesar)cipher, probably ROT14. So, Ciphey should easily decode it and we should have got the plain text back. But It was failed to crack the encoded string.

		As discussed in the discord, this is sort of intended behaviour, since this is clearly not standard english text, a flag, or JSON. The checks that prevent this from being decoded can be bypassed with this (assuming you have a crib of squad):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ciphey -t "Ecgudfxq_EcGmP" -p caesar.p_value=-1 -C regex -p regex.regex=(?i)squad
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To break this rather cryptic command down:



Flags
Description




-t  "Ecgudfxq_EcGmP"
Your ciphertext


-p caesar.p_value=-1
Allows any casear candidates that have more than a -100% chance to be used (i.e. all of them)


-C regex  -p regex.regex=(?i)squad
Use the regex checker with the crib squad. The (?i) is a python regex flag that means to use a case-insensitive search

		On closer inspection, it appears that this is actually a symptom of #291. This may work after that is fixed
Edit: It's not to do with casing

		I am closing this issue because it's solved. Currently running ciphey -t "Ecgudfxq_EcGmP" works for me, without using regex. It gets decrypted by the Affine cracker (this is because Affine with a = 1 is the equivalent of a Caesar cipher) and then the underscore gets converted to a space by the leetspeak decoder.
