		I solved this problem by installing 64 bit Python.
If you have a Windows operating system, of course

		For Linux, this might be because of outdated PIP tool, upgrade pip3 first, then install ciphey
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python3 -m pip install pip --upgrade
python3 -m pip install ciphey --upgrade
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I'm closing this issue because you didn't fill out the full issue template so we don't know what system you're on and what versions. This error is usually caused by not using 64 bit Python and/or not using Python 3.7 or 3.8.
