	<summary>Spooky hex output for byte input</summary>
	<description>
‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏è if you do not fill this out, we will automatically delete your issue. We will not help anyone that cannot fill out this template.

 Have you read our Wiki page "Common Issues &amp; Their Solutions"?

Describe the bug
Ciphey outputs random hex digit pairs when run on practically any ciphertext when set to bytes mode, and when the output is not redirected (i.e. into less)
Plaintext
‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏è The below code is non-negotiable for "Ciphey didn't decrypt...." problems. If you do not tell us your plaintext, we will not help you.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;hello, world
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

or any other string
Version
‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏è We need this information because different environments will induce different bugs in Ciphey

OS/Distro: Debian
Python version: Python 3.8.5
Ciphey versions: master (775fabe)
Did you use Docker? Nope

		This should be closed, since this is no longer the case in the master branch of CipheyCore. It is however still in , and is as far as I can see due to the following snippet &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/CipheyCore/blob/d7c7725bba90971e9757be1f039403c9e935ec71/include/ciphey/swig.hpp#L190-L195&gt;https://github.com/Ciphey/CipheyCore/blob/d7c7725bba90971e9757be1f039403c9e935ec71/include/ciphey/swig.hpp#L190-L195&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Also, a quick way to ensure that this code path is the one leading to this issue is to create a small py file anywhere in the Ciphey project with the following (both plaintext and candidate key can be chosen arbitrarily):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import cipheycore
plaintext = "AA".encode()
candidate_key = 0x00
cipheycore.xor_single_decrypt(plaintext, candidate_key)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

By running this file you can observe the random hex output (make sure to be on tag v.0.3.1)

 - should this be closed as it is no longer in CipheyCore master? Also, this is/was a problem related to CipheyCore, not Ciphey itself.

 this bug is still an issue because CipheyCore hasn't been updated and is still on 0.3.1. Can you release CipheyCore 0.3.2 on PyPI? Thank you.
