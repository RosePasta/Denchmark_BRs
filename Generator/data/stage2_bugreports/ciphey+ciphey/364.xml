		If you had read this page (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Common-Issues-&amp;-Their-Solutions&gt;https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Common-Issues-&amp;-Their-Solutions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), you would see that this is an already known issue with Mac OS, and is solved by using Docker.
I am closing this because this is a duplicate issue and we already have instructions on how to install Docker in the documentation. If you encounter any bugs using Ciphey with Docker, you can make a separate issue and if you need support we have a Discord.
