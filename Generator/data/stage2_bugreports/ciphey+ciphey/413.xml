Plaintext
‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏è The below code is non-negotiable for "Ciphey didn't decrypt...." problems. If you do not tell us your plaintext, we will not help you.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Not sure what the plaintext is, it was the example from the documentation
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Version
‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏è We need this information because different environments will induce different bugs in Ciphey

OS/Distro: macOS Catalina
Python version: 3.8
Ciphey versions: Whatever version is in docker right now
Did you use Docker? Yes



&lt;denchmark-link:https://pastebin.com/TMVDnk4f&gt;https://pastebin.com/TMVDnk4f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

What input did you use? docker run -it --rm remnux/ciphey "=MXazlHbh5WQgUmchdHbh1EIy9mZgQXarx2bvRFI4VnbpxEIBBiO4VnbNVkU"
What flags / arguments did you use? No extra flags or arguments

Expected behavior
To see ciphey decrypt or at least attempt to decrypt the input

		I found a workaround by using a different docker base image python:3.7.9-slim-buster
So the full dockerfile would just be:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;FROM python:3.7.9-slim-buster
LABEL version="1.1"
LABEL description="Ciphey - An Automated Decoding and Decryption Tool"
LABEL maintainer="Lenny Zeltser"
ENV LANG C.UTF-8
ENV LANGUAGE C.UTF-8
ENV LC_ALL C.UTF-8

USER root

RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip &amp;&amp; \
  pip3 install --upgrade ciphey &amp;&amp; \
  groupadd -r nonroot &amp;&amp; \
  useradd -m -r -g nonroot -d /home/nonroot -s /usr/sbin/nologin -c "Nonroot User" nonroot &amp;&amp; \
  mkdir -p /home/nonroot/workdir &amp;&amp; \
  chown -R nonroot:nonroot /home/nonroot

USER nonroot
ENV HOME /home/nonroot
WORKDIR /home/nonroot/workdir
VOLUME ["/home/nonroot/workdir"]
ENV USER nonroot
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/ciphey"]
CMD ["--help"]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This doesn't fix the issue, since ciphey should be able to work with python3.8, but this is a possible temporary workaround

		Hi!
I'm only just being drafted in to have a look at this. Thanks for raising the issue, I understand what the problem is here. As it stands, Ciphey relies on REMnux's DockerHub Repo. We can't do any CI/testing and issues such as caching (which is where I think this problem specifically lays within)
I'm going to be making Ciphey a little bit more self-sustainable in this regard over the next day or so.

This doesn't fix the issue, since Ciphey should be able to work with python3.8, but this is a possible temporary workaround

Exactly this for the time being! (:
I've pushed a working build to cmnatic/ciphey in lieu of creating a Ciphey organisation tomorrow, in the mean while, you can see example usage below:
docker run -it --rm cmnatic/ciphey =MXazlHbh5WQgUmchdHbh1EIy9mZgQXarx2bvRFI4VnbpxEIBBiO4VnbNVkU
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Result on a brand new DO Droplet:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


replace "=MXazlHbh5WQgUmchdHbh1EIy9mZgQXarx2bvRFI4VnbpxEIBBiO4VnbNVkU" with your value appropriately

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;As it stands, files cannot be parsed to Ciphey i.e. ciphey -f input.txt as I wasn't quite expecting to be anywhere near publishing yet.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMNatic/Ciphey/blob/cmn-dockerfile-py-deb10/Dockerfile&gt; Dockerfile&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that this is created from is a "band-aid" until I can afford the time to implement all of the above ^^ (note how there are minuscule changes made from the REMnux Dockerfile, where it's accredited nonetheless)
