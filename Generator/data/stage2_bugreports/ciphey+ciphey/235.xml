	<summary>Common Ciphey install solutions</summary>
	<description>
If you're having problems installing Ciphey, read this.


 Read this first https://docs.ciphey.online/en/latest/install.html


 Are you using the latest version of Python? 3.8 and above? Ciphey does not support Python 2. Make sure to update :)


On Mac?
Mac has some rather unique dylib searching functionality, which can lead to weird segfaults and errors.

 Try using the xor-ciphers branch

On Windows?
Windows users normally accidentally install 32-bit Python, as opposed to 64 bit. Please install 64 fit. Check this issue out for more info: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/issues/233#issuecomment-668695626&gt;#233 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


 Still can't install? Please submit an issue using the bug report template.
