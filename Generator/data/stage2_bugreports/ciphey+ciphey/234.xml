	<summary>Couldn't find cipheycore-0.2.9 on Windows</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The latest version of cipheycore on Windows is 0.1.0, but ciphey requires 0.2.9 or higher

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
python version: 3.8 on Windows
pip version: 20.2
run 'pip install ciphey', it shows "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cipheycore&lt;0.3.0,&gt;=0.2.8 (from ciphey) (from versions: 0.0.1, 0.1.0)"

But on Linux, it will install cipheycore-0.2.9-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl, which is the latest version of cipheycore.

On the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/CipheyCore&gt;page of cipheycore&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it shows Windows release build failing

		I am having the same issue on Windows in the terminal trying to install Ciphey, I get a Ciphey Core issue. I am running Python 3.8.2.
Running:
"python -m pip install -U ciphey"
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cipheycore&lt;0.3.0,&gt;=0.2.8 (from ciphey) (from versions: 0.0.1, 0.1.0)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for cipheycore&lt;0.3.0,&gt;=0.2.8 (from ciphey)
Running:
"python3 -m pip install -U ciphey" does nothing for some reason, no output on the command line.
I tried to install cipheycore manually:
"python -m pip install -U cipheycore==0.2.9"
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cipheycore==0.2.9 (from versions: 0.0.1, 0.1.0)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for cipheycore==0.2.9
I did verify my pip is updated:
"python -m pip install --upgrade pip"
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in c:\users\xxxxxxx\appdata\local\programs\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages (20.2.1)

 Would it be possible for you to update to the latest pytthon 3.8 (3.8.5) and try again?

		Are you running on a 32 bit machine?

		I just wanted to add, I solved this by having to install Python through the Windows App Store instead of the standalone package.
