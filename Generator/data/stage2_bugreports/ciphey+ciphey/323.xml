		Per the bug report template, we have this section:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Common-Issues-&amp;-Their-Solutions&gt;https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey/wiki/Common-Issues-&amp;-Their-Solutions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you had filled out the bug report, you would have seen we have issues with Mac OS which are solved by using Docker.
This GitHub issue does not follow our template, it is a duplicate of another issue, and this issue is solved in our documentation so I am closing it :)
