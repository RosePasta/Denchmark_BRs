I get the following error when I run my training. When I comment out this line the training works but the loss doesn't decrease
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/storage/home/ec2-user/ner/trainer/trainer.py", line 131, in _train_epoch
  self.model.step()
File "/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deepspeed/pt/deepspeed_light.py", line 628, in step
  fp32_param.grad = fp16_param.grad.to(fp32_param.dtype)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to'
  self.optimizer.step()
File "/home/ec2-user/anaconda3/envs/pytorch_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/deepspeed/pt/fp16_unfused_optimizer.py", line 165, in step
  fp32_param.grad = fp16_param.grad.to(fp32_param.dtype)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'to'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Tejaswgupta&gt;@Tejaswgupta&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for reaching out and wanting to contribute. Is there something specific you have in mind you'd like to contribute? If it was this issue I do have a PR being reviewed currently that fixes this issue. We're in the process of trying to create some new issues that would be good to take care of as a new user. Keep an eye out for those :)

, Thanks for bringing this bug to our attention. We previously fixed this type of bug in a different code path but now have added unit tests for it and fixed it in your code path and one other. The PR should be merged soon.
