The issue here that I see test/validation statistics for the last epoch,  not last improved.
Is that a bug or the feature?

		Let me look inot it. Also, that part of the code will undergo quite some substantial reworking before v0.3 exits the alpha stage anyway, so this it is great that if this is an error we are catching it now.

		After looking into this I confirm that the test stats are computed using the model at the last epoch.
We'll fix this in the ongoing refactoring.
As a temporary workaround i suggest first training and then loading the trained model from disk (which is the best on validation) and then performing the eval/test.

 yeah, we do this anyway, but noticed weird test_statistics one time. Good to know it's a bug :)

		Can you please check the commit above? it should solve the issue.
If the model was saved during training, i.e. we have a way to recover the model saved at the epoch where max performance on validation is reached, we load it before runnign the prediction.
If the model was not saved during training, we can only use the model at the last epoch, which is what the training process returns.
Please confirm if this is ok for you.
