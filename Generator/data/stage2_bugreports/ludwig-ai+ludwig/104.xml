	<summary>Training using training data and validation CSV caused errors</summary>
	<description>
When using "train" command with training and validation data will cause inappropriate attribute access violation for Dataframe.
I was running ludwig on Windows 10 and Python 3.6.8.
ludwig train --data_train_csv data_train.csv --data_validation_csv data_val.csv -mdf model.yaml

Using training raw csv, no hdf5 and json file with the same name have been found

		Thanks for posting this issue. This may be a bug, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ydudin3&gt;@ydudin3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please look into this?
In the meantime, as a workaround I would suggest you to concatenate your CSVs and adding a column named split contaning a value 0 for the training datapoints, 1 for validation and 2 for test if you have any. This script does it for you: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/data/concatenate_datasets.py&gt;https://github.com/uber/ludwig/blob/master/ludwig/data/concatenate_datasets.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/allenkao&gt;@allenkao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , we pushed a pull request &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ludwig-ai/ludwig/pull/125&gt;#125&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that should solve your issue. Can you please test with the current code on master and confirm that that's the case?
