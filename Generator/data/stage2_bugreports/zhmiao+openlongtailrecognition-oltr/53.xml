	<summary>embedded_gaussian is not trained</summary>
	<description>



OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/run_networks.py


         Line 76
      in
      4dc25ea






 if 'selfatt' not in param_name and 'fc' not in param_name: 





Seeing this line, Stage1 config and Stage2 config, I noticed that embedded gaussian non-local filtering is not trained at all as "selfatt" is not present in ModulatedAttLayer. In Stage 1 we don't use the modulated attention  


OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/config/Places_LT/stage_1.py


         Line 19
      in
      4dc25ea






 feature_param = {'use_modulatedatt': False, 'use_fc': True, 'dropout': None, 





In Stage 2 we use it: 


OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/config/Places_LT/stage_2_meta_embedding.py


         Line 20
      in
      4dc25ea






 feature_param = {'use_modulatedatt': True, 'use_fc': True, 'dropout': None,  





initialize it, but then fix all the convolution layers weights due to:



OpenLongTailRecognition-OLTR/config/Places_LT/stage_2_meta_embedding.py


         Line 26
      in
      4dc25ea






 'fix': True} 





and the above if condition.
Should we change "selfatt" to "modulatedatt"

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ily-R&gt;@ily-R&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , thanks for asking. I think you are right, we need to change this to modulatedatt. I think it is a bug when we were renaming modules for code publication. We will update the code asao

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ily-R&gt;@ily-R&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , the codes are updated, and we have newly implemented results and weights for Places-LT as well. Please check it out. Thanks.
