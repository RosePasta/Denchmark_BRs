Similar with the issues mentioned above (works well when synthesizing, but cannot train) , but this is not mitigated by setting fast mode during evaluation.
The alignment is not done well even in 210 k step, while the previous version(pytorch 0.3) with the same hparams worked.
Pytorch 0.4 (Based on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/r9y9/deepvoice3_pytorch/commit/2b90e086c8048f3210c0a29911e535f884e872ce&gt;2b90e08&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
