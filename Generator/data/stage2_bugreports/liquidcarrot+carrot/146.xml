	<summary>NEAT showing wrong inputs and connection count</summary>
	<description>
i tried running this script to testing out some basic model
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    const dataset = [
        { input: [0,0], output: [0] },
        { input: [0,1], output: [1] },
        { input: [1,0], output: [1] },
        { input: [1,1], output: [0] }
    ];
   let Pops = new Neat(2,1);
   Pops.evaluate(dataset);
   let fittest = Pops.getFittest();
   console.log(fittest.toJSON());`
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

output
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "bias": 0,
      "type": "input",
      "squash": "LOGISTIC",
      "mask": 1,
      "index": 0
    },
    {
      "bias": 0.039815399456396255,
      "type": "output",
      "squash": "LOGISTIC",
      "mask": 1,
      "index": 1
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "weight": 1.2941470809287727,
      "from": 0,
      "to": 1,
      "gater": null
    }
  ],
  "input": 1,
  "output": 1,
  "dropout": 0
}`
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

however the json output showing that there's only one node and one connection,
do i missed something ???

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/winatawelly&gt;@winatawelly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for pointing this out. This is an interesting, but unexpected behavior -- I'll take a deeper look and get back to you on what might be going on

Hi!,
Just letting you know that I just tried my earlier code on nodejs and it worked perfectly, however the "type" on "node" is undefined on all nodes.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[ { bias: 0.6161864528072978,
    type: undefined,
    squash: 'LOGISTIC',
    mask: 1,
    index: 0 },
  { bias: 0.7912470525327948,
    type: undefined,
    squash: 'LOGISTIC',
    mask: 1,
    index: 1 },
  { bias: -0.04250138077694432,
    type: undefined,
    squash: 'LOGISTIC',
    mask: 1,
    index: 2 } ],
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		It looks like this is related to the webpack bundling script.
Going to keep debugging a bit more.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/winatawelly&gt;@winatawelly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 -- just wanted to give a heads up that we're reworking various parts of Neat to try and fix this bug
Since this issue I've found some other bugs exclusive to the front-end, they all seem very similar so I suspect there's a common cause
