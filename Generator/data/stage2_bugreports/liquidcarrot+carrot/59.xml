	<summary>LSTM and GRU creating large networks</summary>
	<description>
LSTM and GRU are creating large networks.
E.g running "new Architect.LSTM(4, 5, 1)" seems to create a network of 100+ nodes.

 I'm having a hard time replicating this on my end - going to close for now.

My Code
let { architect } = require("@liquid-carrot/carrot");

console.log([(new architect.LSTM(4, 5, 1)).nodes.length, (new architect.LSTM(4, 5, 1)).nodes.length, (new architect.LSTM(4, 5, 1)).nodes.length]) // [ 25, 25, 25 ]
console.log([(new architect.GRU(4, 5, 1)).nodes.length, (new architect.GRU(4, 5, 1)).nodes.length, (new architect.GRU(4, 5, 1)).nodes.length]) // [ 35, 35, 35 ]

		I was still getting it last night using Neat with the latest version. Try running my script I gave but make sure Neat creates Architect.LSTM instead of random.

		I'll look into it.

		Actually, it seems that might not have come from LSTM. Looks like the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/liquidcarrot/carrot/issues/31&gt;#31&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 issue is going into overdrive.
