	<summary>question about neat.evolve()</summary>
	<description>
on the documentation page about neat.evolve &lt;denchmark-link:https://liquidcarrot.io/carrot/Neat.html&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there are "pick" and "adjust". but at the very bottom of code snippet, evolve is using "filter" which is never defined.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;let pick = function pickGenome(genome) return genome.nodes.length &gt; 100 ? true : false // Remove genomes with more than 100 nodes
let adjust = function adjustGenome(genome) return genome.clear() // clear the nodes

neat.evolve(null, filter, adjust)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and when i tried replacing "filter" with "pick", the code returned an error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ReferenceError: adjustGenome is not defined

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

can someone explain this ?

		Will look at a fix...looks like that slipped through during our last big push for a test suite.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/winatawelly&gt;@winatawelly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'll be cleaning up this code, should have a fix and explanation for you very soon!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/winatawelly&gt;@winatawelly&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! Okay so,  gives the user the ability to manually pick and filter networks as they get mutated at a couple points (before and after mutation) and it uses a function called  to do that. It seems like there was a disconnect between the code inside  and the new  so that was just updated.
The docs were based on an older version of the function so there was a mismatch -- just updated and everything should be running smoothly
See the new docs entry here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://liquidcarrot.io/carrot/Neat.html#.replace&gt;https://liquidcarrot.io/carrot/Neat.html#.replace&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Closing this one for now üëç

Hi @winatawelly! Okay so, Neat.evolve gives the user the ability to manually pick and filter networks as they get mutated at a couple points (before and after mutation) and it uses a function called Neat.replace to do that. It seems like there was a disconnect between the code inside Neat.evolve and the new Neat.replace so that was just updated.
The docs were based on an older version of the function so there was a mismatch -- just updated and everything should be running smoothly
See the new docs entry here:

appreciate it, thanks mate!
