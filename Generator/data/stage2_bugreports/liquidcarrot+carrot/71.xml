	<summary>Network.evolve() &amp; Neat.evolve() not mutating network</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running network.evolve() &amp; Neat.evolve() both are producing silent failures or not evolving the the network.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using Node.js v10.15.3 and running the following code, produces the following error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


none of the created networks to throw an error
the error value to change

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Screenshots&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is a large possibility that a large part of this error is coming from the fact that because the output neurons are no longer mutable and the activation functions thereof default to sigmoid, regression output outside of the (0, 1) can create huge network training issue - like experienced here.

 do you have a code snippet that will cause this error? There have been some recent changes to Neat in an experimental branch and I'd like to see if this bug was resolved.
