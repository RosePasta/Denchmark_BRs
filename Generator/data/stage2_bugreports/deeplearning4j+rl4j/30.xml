	<summary>HistoryProcessor width and height switched</summary>
	<description>
In the current codebase (0.8-snapshot), the transform method of org.deeplearning4j.rl4j.learning.HistoryProcessor seems to have swapped rescaled width and height when resizing:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        Mat resized = new Mat(conf.getRescaledHeight(), conf.getRescaledWidth(), CV_8UC(1));
        resize(cvmat, resized, new Size(conf.getRescaledHeight(), conf.getRescaledWidth()));
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I suspect that either people have worked around this by swapping those values in the history processor configuration (which I can confirm does work), or simply haven't notices because they were using square images.

		wait - I may have messed up and it's actually the cropping dimensions that are backwards. Give me some time to confirm and get back to you.

		Ok, sorry about that, now I'm fairly certain it is correct (but please double check - it gets confusing with all the swaps :( ).
Once I swapped the resize, I needed to swap the final reshape. The history processor config is now sane - with x and y's matching between resize and crop and the resulting buffer isn't squished.
