	<summary>Cannot get DQN from policy</summary>
	<description>
In this file, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/rl4j/blob/273564b2e35294a83893688b9033013fe24129b6/rl4j-core/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/rl4j/policy/DQNPolicy.java&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/rl4j/blob/273564b2e35294a83893688b9033013fe24129b6/rl4j-core/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/rl4j/policy/DQNPolicy.java&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , why is getNeuralNet() protected? After loading a policy from a saved file, I need access to the DQN in order to train it further.

		So, obviously, I could work from the source and have this change in my code immediately. However, I'm primarily using my POM to import the latest dependencies through Maven ... when will I be able to get this change through Maven, and what would the version number be?

		You would have to enable snapshots in your POM and then use 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT as a version.
Problem is that snapshots are currently broken and last one was generated more than a month ago.
