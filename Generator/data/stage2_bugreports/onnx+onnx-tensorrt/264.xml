		I also meet the same problem when the onnx model come from torch.onnx.export, however the pretrained onnx model from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/classification/resnet&gt;https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/classification/resnet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 works well.

		Is this still reproducible with the latest TensorRT version, if so can you provide the network you are using?
