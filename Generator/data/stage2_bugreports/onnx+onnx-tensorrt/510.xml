Reproduction instructions
System Information
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g. Linux Ubuntu 16.04): jetpack 4.4
ONNX version (e.g. 1.6): 1.4.1
Backend/Runtime version (e.g. ONNX Runtime 1.1, PyTorch 1.2): pytorch 1.5
Provide a code snippet to reproduce your errors.
import onnx
model = onnx.load('model.onnx')
...
Notes
I used my own .pth model to Onnx. and Onnx to TRT ,also ouucr

		Can you provide us the ONNX model for us to debug with? The INT64 warning is there to notify the user that we are downcasting any INT64 indices to INT32. Generally this has no effect on the resulting ONNX model and inference. It's these lines that are causing the issue:

		Closing due to inactivity from OP. If anyone else is having the same issue feel free to open a new issue and attach the ONNX model you are using.
