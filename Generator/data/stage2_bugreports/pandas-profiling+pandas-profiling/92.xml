	<summary>fails with category columns on sample</summary>
	<description>
With a very large file it can be useful to analyse a sample. However this fails for category columns as max_freq is zero (see below error). More generally would be useful if any columns generating an error could just show as "error" as remainder of the report is still useful.
~\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pandas_profiling\report.py in _format_row(freq, label, max_freq, row_template, n, extra_class)

57     def _format_row(freq, label, max_freq, row_template, n, extra_class=''):
---&gt; 58             width = int(freq / max_freq * 99) + 1
59             if width &gt; 20:
60                 label_in_bar = freq
ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer
