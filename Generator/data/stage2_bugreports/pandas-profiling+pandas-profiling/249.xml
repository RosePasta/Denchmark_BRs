		Oh and the same error happens when a column has mixed datatypes: I used df.reset_index() to move by index to a column to work around the issue, but got the same error.
I know I should fix my datatypes, and I don't really think this needs fixing in profile_report(), but if it gave a nice warning instead of failing, that would be helpful. It took me a moment to find the cause of the error.
