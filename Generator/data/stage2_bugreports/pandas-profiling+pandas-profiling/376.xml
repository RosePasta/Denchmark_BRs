	<summary>pandas-profiling not compatible with pandas v1.0</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
pandas-profiling not compatible with pandas v1.0. The key method "ProfileReport" returns error "TypeError: concat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'join_axes'" as join_axes is deprecated starting from Pandas v1.0.
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html?highlight=concat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To Reproduce
import pandas as pd
import pandas_profiling
def test_issueXXX():
df = pd.read_csv(r'')
pf = pandas.profiling.ProfileReport(df)
TypeError: concat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'join_axes'
Version information:

Python version: 3.7.
Environment: Command Line and Pycharm
pandas-profiling: 1.4.1
pandas: 1.0

 to address this, I decided to downgrade pandas to before 1.0. To downgrade, I uninstalled Anaconda and reinstalled using the October 2019 installer from here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/&gt;https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ... Now I can use pandas_profiling.

 Thank you! that worked for me too - using pandas 0.25.0 in a new environment. Cheers!

		I do not want to downgrade. If any one can let me know that with the current version of Anaconda, when this or are this error going to be taken care, so that we can use Pandas profiling.

		Nope I haven't found a way. I would guess the pandas_profiling folks will
fix it in the next couple months, and until then I'm using pandas 0.25
installed via installing the old Anaconda 3 from last October.

  I have upgraded the pandas profiling to 1.3/1.4 and it works for me.
you should all try that.

		Hi All,

When we work and establish something -that's what we measure in the ongoing
process and make it as a practice to run the process in the enterprise.
If a product evolves it has a backward compatibility that makes it more
sustainable.

Its good to research and explore and improve the product. But adoption of a
product means its sustainable. So when a version changes it should have the
backward compatibility in the pipeline of change. This is not here in case
of pandas profiling so it fails in adopting  the feature that anybody like
to make it as industry standard.

I would rather prefer if there is a change in any product , its dependent
should be technically capable of not dropping that feature, as most cases
are not similar like this.

Thanks,
Debashis

		The code has been changed and if you don't want to downgrade your program, try with this code instead of&lt; join_axes&gt;.
For example,
result = pd.concat([df1, df4], axis=1, join_axes=[df1.index])
--&gt; result = pd.concat([df1, df4], axis=1).reindex(df1.index)
Good luck for everyone!

Sounds like an incompatible version of pandas. Alternatively, you could set up a clean environment to see if the error persists.

I'm using Collabatory due to some issues with running Exoplanet code in Windows. It says that im running Pandas 1.0.3 and I've tried to update pandas-profiling which now says its running 2.6.0.
I've tried running it in a new notebook however the error still persists.
