Describe the bug
TemplateNotFound: components/tabs.html
To Reproduce
My dataframe is confidential and cannot be provided here. But I ran the titanic.py file [from pandas-profiling/examples/titanic/titanic.py], completely unmodified, and got the same error.

pandas==0.24.2
numpy==1.16.2
pandas-profiling==2.1.1
...etc.
Please see pip_freeze.txt file attached.

I used pandas profiling last week, and it was working perfectly. When I pip installed it today to my new computer, somehow this error kept coming up. I am inexperienced in programming and I apologize in advance if it ends up being my mistake when using the package. Thank you!
