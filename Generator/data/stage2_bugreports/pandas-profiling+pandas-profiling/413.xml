	<summary>Latest release is not outputing correlations?</summary>
	<description>
The html report does not show correlations or interactions.
To Reproduce
Example from docs:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;df = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.rand(100, 5),
    columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
)

profile = ProfileReport(df, title='Pandas Profiling Report', html={
                        'style': {'full_width': True}})
profile
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output of the progresss bar is the following:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22077628/77051611-d6b9cd80-69cb-11ea-8d26-a182fd82e9f5.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Version information:
Additional context
EDIT:
There was an error on a previous calculation that disabled the proper calculation for the rest of the notebook.
After restarting the notebook the following additional warning message appeared:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;.../python3.7/site-packages/pandas_profiling/model/correlations.py:135: UserWarning: There was an attempt to calculate the cramers correlation, but this failed.
To hide this warning, disable the calculation
(using `df.profile_report(correlations={"cramers": {"calculate": False}})`
If this is problematic for your use case, please report this as an issue:
https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues
(include the error message: 'No data; `observed` has size 0.')
  correlation_name=correlation_name, error=error
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This warning occured with the calculation of the more complex dataset though.
