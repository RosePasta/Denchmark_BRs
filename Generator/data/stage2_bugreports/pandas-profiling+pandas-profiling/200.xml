Describe the bug
Something wrong with freqtable, I cannot add anything particular yet.
To Reproduce
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import pandas as pd
import pandas_profiling
data = {'author': ['Kellymom', 'Tori'],
 'body': ["love this shampoo and conditioner set it smells awesome it's hydrating so when you wash your hair it's softer and easier to manage. they're not full size containers they are a bit smaller not too much smaller because it's still a great value as you would consider that one of these is almost $4 and that for two of them it's just under 5 it's a great deal is what I'm saying.",
  'Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner! The poducts i was using were gettjng too expensive so i needed to change and im so glad i did. Ive been using the hello hydration for 3 days now and i can already tell a huge difference. I have naturally really curly hair and after using these products my hair feels instantly softer. I highly recommend buying hello hydration if you want to have softer smoother hair without paying a fortune!'],
