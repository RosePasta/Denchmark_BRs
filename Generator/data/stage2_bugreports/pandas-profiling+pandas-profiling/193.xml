	<summary>Installing the library through conda defaults to the pre 2.0.0 version.</summary>
	<description>
While pip lets you install the 2.0.+ version, conda still defaults to the old 1.4.1 version and even with explicit expression, it doesn't work. Is it advisable to download the library from the source as of now?

		Thank you for reporting this issue. We are aware that pandas-profiling on conda is not up to date. However, the maintenance of conda-forge is not done by us.

		Sorry for my ignorance on this, but I just checked the conda-forge feedstock PRs and it looks like the automated checks have been passed. Do you know what else needs to be done to get conda-forge to accept the updated version? I'm not familiar with that workflow but am desperate to get v2 available on conda-forge.
