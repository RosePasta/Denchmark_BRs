	<summary>Profiling changes column names of original dataframe</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
profile_report() has the side effect of changing spaces in column names to underscores.
To Reproduce
"""
Test for issue XXX:
https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/XXX
"""
import pandas as pd
import pandas_profiling

def test_issueXXX():
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=[[1,2],[3,4]], columns=['Col 1', 'Col 2'])
    columns_before = df.columns
    df.profile_report()
    assert df.columns.tolist() == columns_before.tolist()

		Same in Python 3.6, every column with spaces in its name is renamed to used underscores in place of spaces. (In my case, that then causes subsequent processing pipeline to fail. Could keep a list of original column names and re-instate them, but would rather profile_report caused no changes.)

		The column names are altered as spaces and colons caused errors for some operations. I agree that pandas-profiling should not have side-effects. Either we solve the problems that occur with certain characters or we re-instate the column names afterwards. This issue should also assess the order of the DataFrame does not change.

		It's not fixed in 2.4.0.
