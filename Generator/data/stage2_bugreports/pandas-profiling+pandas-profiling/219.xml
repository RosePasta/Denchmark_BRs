If this is problematic for your use case, please report this as an issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues&gt;https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

(include the error message: 'The internally computed table of expected frequencies has a zero element at (0, 1).')
correlation_name=correlation_name, error=error
df.profile_report  ??
I don't see a method profile_report  for df (the data frame)
i'm using:
profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(df)
Tried,
profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(df, check_correlation=False))
Then,
profile = df.profile_report(check_correlation_cramers=False, check_correlation_pearson=False, check_correlation=False)
Nothing is working.

		Upgraded pandas_profiling from 1.4.2  and i started getting this error.
There was an attempt to calculate the cramers correlation, but this failed.
To hide this warning, disable the calculation
(using df.profile_report(correlations={"cramers": False})
Where is this profile_report coming from ???
I could not find that method for pandas dataframe or pandas_profiling.
I am using ProfileReport which is from pandas_profiling
As mentioned in the ticket, i tried many things, but still failing to produce the report, so now revered back to 1.4.2 and it is working.
Thanks.

		We cannot test where this problem comes from, unless you provide:

the minimal code you are using to generate the report
which environment you are using (jupyter notebook or IDE)
a sample or description of the dataset
