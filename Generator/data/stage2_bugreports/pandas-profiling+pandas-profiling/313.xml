	<summary>Readme link to the latest tag is broken</summary>
	<description>
The readme link is to ...pandas-profiling/releases/tag/v2.4.0, but the latest release is (not too systematically) tagged as v2.4 (no patch version). So the link does not work. You could add a new 2.4.0 tag, but I guess since the release has happened, it would look weird. So we could either change the README link... or wait until 2.4.1.
