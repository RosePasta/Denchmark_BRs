	<summary>Sort = None not working in config .yaml</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Same problem as:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/issues/343#issue-552156223&gt;#343 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but:
I think the sorting configuration is not working for sort: None, it does work for ascening and descending.
pandas_profiling version = 2.4.1
python version = 3.7.3
environtment = jupyter notebook
To Reproduce
profile = ProfileReport(df, title='Pandas Profiling Report', config_file='config_custom.yaml')
in config_custom.yaml...
sort: None
And the variables are getting sorted in ascending order.
Version information:
pandas_profiling version = 2.4.1
python version = 3.7.3
environtment = jupyter notebook

		I could not reproduce the variables getting sorted in ascending order. However, the multithreading returns the variables in arbitrary order. The sort masked this behaviour afterwards.
The next version will fix this issue and include additional tests on the sorting.

		Thanks for the heads up. It was the multithreading option indeed.
