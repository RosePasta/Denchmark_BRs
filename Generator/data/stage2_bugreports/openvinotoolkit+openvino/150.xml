	<summary>OpenVINO 2019R1/R1.01 with mask rcnn error:Plugin MKLDNNPlugin cannot be loaded</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

OpenCV =&gt; 4.1.0
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows10 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2017
OpenVINO =&gt; w_openvino_toolkit_p_2019.1.133
I think I have installed OpenVINO 2019R1 successfully, because I have run demo_security_barrier_camera.bat and get right result as follows.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15775782/57497086-cdba9300-7308-11e9-88e0-ae0d37453f75.JPG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Also, I have trained a faster-rcnn model and tested with openvino and get right result. Then I test my mask-rcnn model, it showed error as follows.
[ ERROR ] Cannot find plugin to use :Tried load plugin : MKLDNNPlugin,  error: Plugin MKLDNNPlugin cannot be loaded: cannot load plugin: MKLDNNPlugin from ../../../lib/intel64: Cannot load library '../../../lib/intel64\MKLDNNPlugin.dll'

Model files and config files are here. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xTI6_bqbZpi3vbeVcFxX1emBSa7QI58z
Test code is OpenCV_Mask_RCNN.cpp, test images are 2.png and 7.png. All files are packed as files.zip.
files.zip

Dose anyone have the same problem or can you help me solve it? Thank you in advance.

		Failing of plugin loading does not depend on the model - loading of the model happens later into the plugin been presented in the process. You have something wrong with setting of environment of pointing the path where to look for the cpu plugin. We are using rpath in the samples that make them working even with partially environment. You need to use proper  LD_LIBRARY_PATH or rpath during linking of your app

 Thank you for your reply. But I still don't quite understand how to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH . Can you elaborate a little more or give an example? Thanks.

You need to specify PATH environment variable (LD_LIBRARY_PATH is for Linux).
Please read documentation carefully, especially in places with setupvars:

		Ups, I have not noted that original message mentioned dll files. Answer from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is correct

 I have already set the environment variable but still have no improvement.

Have you been able to make progress ? What others &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/elvin-nnov&gt;@elvin-nnov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 say above is correct.  If you are still stuck, here is a good option.  Build a debug version of IE using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/dldt/blob/2019/inference-engine/README.md&gt;these steps&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Step through your code. I guarantee you that you'll figure it out. That's the great thing about using DLDT - the errors will never be a mystery. You can see exactly why the plugin is refusing to load.
Hope this helps.
Thanks for using OpenVino !

		Hi,
The issues is still relevant for the last OpenVINO package?
Did you use setup_vars script to set the right environment?

 Can you check dependencies for MKLDNNPlugin? Maybe some dependencies were not resolved.

First of all try to find  and check that it exists.
After that please check dependencies for the plugin, you can use &lt;denchmark-link:http://www.dependencywalker.com/&gt;Dependency Walker&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for it. This tool shows you all dependencies for the plugin, please check that all dependencies are resolved.
I think all should work if the Inference Engine detects the MKLDNNPlugin.dll and all plugin dependencies are resolved.
