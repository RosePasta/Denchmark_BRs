	<summary>How to run the image classification</summary>
	<description>
It seems the section "Run the Image Classification Sample Application" is outdated. The first step says "Go to the samples build directory" with the following command cd &lt;OPENVINO_DIR&gt;/inference-engine/bin/intel64/Release. As we can see below, there is no such directory:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/workspace/openvino/inference-engine$ ls
cmake           ie_bridges  samples  src   tests             thirdparty
CMakeLists.txt  include     scripts  temp  tests_deprecated  tools
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

How to proceed with the tutorial "Get Started with OpenVINO™ Toolkit on Linux*"?

		I searched my directories for intel64/Release and found this folder in the following path /openvino/bin/intel64/Release which is not located at the inference-engine folder as pointed by the tutorial.
Then, I run the recommended command and got the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/workspace/openvino/bin/intel64/Release$ ./classification_sample_async -i ../../../scripts/demo/car.png -m ../../../ir_dir/squeezenet1.1.xml -d CPU

According to the received message, I searched for a bmp file in the demo folder, finding the car_1.bmp. But I got the following error:

How to deal with this? Is there some updated documentation?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cezane&gt;@cezane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for reporting, we will definelty need to update our documentation as the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/get-started-linux.md#run-the-image-classification-sample-application&gt;Get Started with OpenVINO™ Toolkit on Linux*&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is outdated.
I tested on my OpenVINO build and did not run into the error you are seeing. I will rebuild with the latest Master branch and test again.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[ WARNING ] Image won't be resized! Please use OpenCV.
[ ERROR ] Valid input images were not found!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

How did you build OpenVINO? Could you provide your cmake command? Did you enable python?

 I did not run into this problem when I tested with the latest master branch last week. How did you build OpenVINO? Could you provide your cmake command? Did you enable python?

		To build OpenVINO, I followed the following instructions: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/build-instruction.md&gt;https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/build-instruction.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I believe I was able to reproduce your issue on master branch. It seems the  is corrupted after the build. Could you check if you can open it from the file explorer?
Try downloading it manually from here and see if the demo works for you.

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jgespino&gt;@jgespino&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I downloaded the car.png image, but the same problem occurs:

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cezane&gt;@cezane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is very strange, I thought it may be with the openvino commit you are using. However, I tested on that same commit and the sample works as expected with both .png and .bmp files.
The error you are seeing with the .png image was fixed for me by re-download the .png as it was corrupted in this commit too. These are the commands I used:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd &lt;OPENVINO_DIR&gt;/scripts/demo
mv car.png car.png.org
wget https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/raw/master/scripts/demo/car.png
cd &lt;OPENVINO_DIR&gt;/bin/intel64/Release
./classification_sample_async ../../../scripts/demo/car.png -m &lt;ir_dir&gt;/squeezenet1.1.xml -d CPU
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I am not able to reproduce your second error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[ WARNING ] Image won't be resized! Please use OpenCV.
[ ERROR ] Valid input images were not found!]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Do you have another system that you can test on?

Jesus

		Sorry for the late answer, we can face such problems with bmp or png images when building samples without OpenCV.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cezane&gt;@cezane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you please check CmakeCache:
//enables OpenCV
ENABLE_OPENCV:BOOL=ON
It may be disabled manually or OpenCV was not found on the system (cmake should throw a warning about that)

		Hello, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mryzhov&gt;@mryzhov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cezane&gt;@cezane&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it should be in build directory when you did cmake build.
You can check if compiled samples are linked with opencv using the ldd command:

		Thank you, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mryzhov&gt;@mryzhov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I found the CMakeCache.txt file. OpenCV is enabled:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;//enables OpenCV
ENABLE_OPENCV:BOOL=ON
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But the compiled samples are not linked. The output of ldd ./classification_sample_async | grep opencv is empty.

, thanks for the info, then cmake could not find the OpenCV.  Could you please verify that OpenCV libs were downloaded by cmake configure here:
&lt;openvino_sources&gt;/inference-engine/temp/opencv_4.5.0
btw, what OS do you use?

		<comment id='16' author='cezane' date='2020-11-16T18:05:51Z'>
		The OpenCV libs were not downloaded:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;~/workspace/openvino$ ls inference-engine/temp/
download/            tbb/                 
gna_02.00.00.1047.1/ vpu/

I am using Ubuntu 18.04.

		Yeh, that is the reason( Could you please create the new build directory, run cmake configure there one more time and send the log?

 solved after a new build. Thank you.
