	<summary>OpenVINO 2020.1 doesn't work on Raspberry Pi and NCS2</summary>
	<description>
OpenVINO 2020.1 simply refuses to work when using the NCS2 in a Raspberry Pi. I'm seeing the error below. I have tested multiple sample applications using both C++ and Python and all give the same error.

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tgonzalez89&gt;@tgonzalez89&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is being considered as a bug and we expect it to be fixed in the next software release.
In the meantime we recommend:
Option 1: Use the previous pre-trained models from the 2019 R3 open model zoo - &lt;denchmark-link:https://download.01.org/opencv/2019/open_model_zoo/R3/20190905_163000_models_bin/&gt;https://download.01.org/opencv/2019/open_model_zoo/R3/20190905_163000_models_bin/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Option 2: Generate the IRv7 using the model optimizer from the full installation of OpenVINO toolkit with the switch --generate_deprecated_IR_V7
Best regards, Max.

How can we do Option 2 with a ready converted model like this one?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/natxopedreira&gt;@natxopedreira&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Since this is already converted IR model, you should either go with Option 1 or try the latest Inference Engine version from latest available OpenVINO toolkit build.

		Thanks @maxl16
Latest one is the same as mentioned in this issue, i think... i tried but not work and im using 2019 models but in 2020 there are more face models that want to try but i do not find a way of do it?
Will they work on opencv?
Do you know when is going to be release a 2020 compatible version on rpi??
Thank you

Have you tried to run Open Model Zoo as well as l_openvino_toolkit_runtime_raspbian_p_2020.2.120 as Inference Engine from the same OpenVINO open source 2020.2 build from here &lt;denchmark-link:https://download.01.org/opencv/2020/openvinotoolkit/2020.2/&gt;https://download.01.org/opencv/2020/openvinotoolkit/2020.2/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Unfortunately, currently I don't have a chance to test it, but I expect that should work.

Glad that you were able to make this work.
For INT8 models inference CPU should meet some requirements from here &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Int8Inference.html&gt;https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Int8Inference.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

cv.dnn.readNet(model_face_xml,model_face_bin)

OpenCV in OpenVINO 2020.2 has a bug for MYRIAD target (however with another message on x86 host). Should be fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/17134&gt;opencv/opencv#17134&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Consider using IE API (see OpenModelZoo demos) or wait for the next OpenVINO release or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Intel%27s-Deep-Learning-Inference-Engine-backend#raspbian-buster&gt;recompile OpenCV from master branch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To be clear, sorry but i never say is an opencv error, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  mentioned that you can read two post up
I followed their advice building opencv from master and error persist
I also followed your advice applying those patches to ngraph and still doesn't work, ngraph people offered help but is asking for info i don't have
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph/issues/4794&gt;NervanaSystems/ngraph#4794&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 , according to the error message, binary OpenVINO is used, not a custom build you tried:

Check 'input_shape_product.get_length() == shape_size(m_output_shape)' failed at /teamcity/work/scoring_engine_build/releases_2020_2/ngraph/src/ngraph/op/reshape.cpp💯

you need to clean build folder first then specify  as mentioned here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/build-instruction.md#add-inference-engine-to-your-project&gt;https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/build-instruction.md#add-inference-engine-to-your-project&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes, thats because i was trying to build and replace only opencv not openvino.

This time i posted on intel forums, but as usually get no answer

As you can see here, is a custom build

Give this a try.

Remove or move your current Openvino
Use the 2020.1.023 Openvino version with the 2019 R1 models
wget https://download.01.org/opencv/2020/openvinotoolkit/2020.1/l_openvino_toolkit_runtime_raspbian_p_2020.1.023.tgz
Install it

Then download the 2019 R1 models such as:

wget --no-check-certificate https://download.01.org/opencv/2019/open_model_zoo/R1/models_bin/face-detection-adas-0001/FP16/face-detection-adas-0001.bin

I have a Pi 4 with the NCS 2 and it worked properly. Good luck!

Also want to use opencv instead IE API because opencv is faster, at least in my tests

Sadly i think is no solution until there is a new openvino release, i tried compiling openvino, opencv, ngraph.... and nothing
But as is a custom model you can try to use this flag "--generate_deprecated_IR_V7" when using the model optimizer to generate IR version, "with that flag you do a lower version model".
Note im not an expert here but problem seems to happens when you want to inference with a IR10 version model, using older models (from 2019R3 release for example) works.
Let us know if works! Good luck!

Did you try a Model Optimizer flag "--generate_deprecated_IR_V7"?
The issue affects only IR v10, but I was sure that the problem was resolved for the master branch.
Could you please try to the last master branch? And provide an error and stacktrace if it doesn't work for your case.

But importing opencv is trowing an error complaining about a lib that is not present when build

NN Builder was deprecated several releases before and it is removed in the master branch.
Looks like something in your environment was built with old version of Inference Engine and depends on this library.
Can you check dependencies for your project? Maybe you have another version of inference engine in the environment.

Note that this error is only doing import cv2 in a python shell and that before setting the enviroment vars it will throw an error as no module named cv2 because python-opencv is not installed
Those are my enviroment vars

Here is it my cmake settings and Docker file

But if you think is helpful i can do a fresh buster install and try it again? Im very interested in making this work and im happy to do all the test that are necesary
Thank you

, you need to build IE first then build OpenCV.  is compiled against OpenVINO 2020.2

 thank you, so i need to build also opencv.... i was only building IE.
Ok, i will build opencv agains openvino built from master branch

 No luck, im not able to build opencv from source
Sure im doing something wrong but i dont know whats happening, note that im able to build opencv without making that change to use custom openvino build instead the one that downloads by default.

 sorry for disturbing, can you please tell me if you know that compiling current opencv master branch against a openvino built also from master branch works in this moment?
I tried several times and always get same error, maybe building with that config is currently broken because of recent changes in openvino master branch
Thank you

, issues is related to nGraph API changes and that IE has no identificators for release version. Please specify release manually: :

 Thank you!! it works but i think something is wrong here.
3 seconds to do an inference on a 320x240 image!!!
import cv2 as cv
import imutils
import time
model_face_bin = 'face-detection-retail-0004.bin'
model_face_xml = 'face-detection-retail-0004.xml'
net = cv.dnn.readNet(model_face_xml,model_face_bin)
net.setPreferableTarget(cv.dnn.DNN_TARGET_MYRIAD)
frame = cv.imread('autofoto.jpg')
frame = imutils.resize(frame, width=320)
inicio = time.time()
blob = cv.dnn.blobFromImage(frame,size=(frame.shape[1],frame.shape[0]),ddepth=cv.CV_8U)
net.setInput(blob)
out = net.forward()
print(time.time()-inicio)

Thank you, just did some test as you suggested with running a first inference to warm up, big difference. I always used this on video so i assume thats why never notice that before. Is like the model in the first inference is loaded on memory or something....i learned something new, thanks

Yes, it works!!! Thank you, i think i have a bad var enviroment value as i can not import openvino, maybe something changed it position on last changes on openvino master, i will take a look later.
