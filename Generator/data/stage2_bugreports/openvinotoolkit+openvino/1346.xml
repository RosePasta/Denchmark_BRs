	<summary>Windows toolkit 2020.x - crash in ngraph.dll but only in debug</summary>
	<description>
Issue originally posted here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/17854&gt;opencv/opencv#17854&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It seems the ngraph debug lib/makefiles are missing from the windows package.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JulienMaille&gt;@JulienMaille&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you for posting this topic on the OpenVINO Github. Have you had a chance to try build OpenVINO from source and grab the missing files as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alalek&gt;@alalek&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested?

		I cloned the repository, then ran cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. followed by cmake --build . --config Debug
I ended up with ngraphd.lib which is smaller in size than ngraph.lib, so I figured that there must be something wrong and stopped!
What should be the next step?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JulienMaille&gt;@JulienMaille&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

My built just completed, the .lib does look a bit smaller in debug but the .dll file is significantly bigger. I suggest completing the built and trying them out.
Release:
ngraph.dll - 5.17 MB
ngraph.lib - 3.07 MB
Debug:
ngraphd.dll - 18.4 MB
ngraphd.lib - 2.96 MB

		So, shall I copy the debug lib and dll in the program files directory next to the original files from openvino installer?
And then recompile openCV?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JulienMaille&gt;@JulienMaille&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
As I understand from the original issue, OpenVINO installer already contains ngraphd.dll and other files, but it misses ngraphTargets-debug.cmake... Am I right?
Try to add ngraphTargets-debug.cmake to the folder with cmake configs. Maybe it can help to solve your problem.

		So generated ngraphd.dll is much smaller (21Mb) than the one found in the windows distribution (112 Mb)
I have copied the missing ngraphTargets-debug.cmake file and re-ran the cmake for OpenCV.
I had to copy ngraphd.dll/lib and onnx_importerd.dll/lib for cmake to work

		I confirm I can properly compile and run opencv in debug mode as long as you add th following files to the windows redistributable:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ngraphTargets-debug.cmake
onnx_importerd.dll
onnx_importerd.lib
ngraphd.lib
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I also believe the ngraphd.dll currently being redistributed is not the right one.

 Thanks for confirming. I am closing this issue, feel free to re-open or start a new one.

 So will you include the missing files in the next Windows redistributable? The current toolkit is broken for anyone who wants to compile in debug mode.

		This should be fixed in the next software release.
