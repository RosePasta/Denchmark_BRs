OpenVINO =&gt; 2020.4
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 64 Bit
Problem classification: Model Conversion
Framework: TensorFlow 1.15
Model name: ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_09
Object detection tensorflow api: master

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description of the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hello,
I retrained the ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_09 model with my own data on the last version of object detection tensorflow api and also with older version such as v1.13.0 but I cannot convert the model to Openvino.
I have the following error:
[ ERROR ] Exception occurred during running replacer "REPLACEMENT_ID" (&lt;class 'extensions.front.ChangePlaceholderTypes.ChangePlaceholderTypes'&gt;): Something bad has happened with graph! Data node "Preprocessor/mul" has 2 producers
I tried many version of object detection tensorflow api, tensorflow and openvino but each time I have the same error...
However, I succeed to convert the model of ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_05_09 provided by the zoo library.
Please if you have any suggestion.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NatachaRuchaudDB&gt;@NatachaRuchaudDB&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you please provide the model optimizer command you are using? Please ensure you are using the configuration file for TensorFlow Object Detection API with , see &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_tf_specific_Convert_Object_Detection_API_Models.html#how_to_convert_a_model&gt;Converting TensorFlow Object Detection API Models&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I also recommend upgrading to the latest OpenVINO 2021.1 release.

Jesus

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jgespino&gt;@jgespino&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The model optimizer command that I use is:
python mo_tf.py  --input_model ..\modelTrain\frozen_inference_graph.pb  --output_dir ..\modelTrain --transformations_config extensions/front/tf/ssd_support_api_v1.15.json  --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config ..\modelTrain\pipeline.config
When I use this command to convert the same model downloaded from the TensorFlow Object Detection API everything is ok. I convert perfectly the tensorflow model to OpenVino.
It is when I re train this model with the TensorFlow Object Detection API I do not succeed to convert to OpenVino the new trained model which is exactly the same than the one downloaded from the TensorFlow Object Detection API (same topology etc..).
I already tried many version of the TensorFlow Object Detection API / Tensorflow / OpenVino with no success. I will re try with OpenVino 2021.1 release and I let you know.
Thank you for your response.
Best,
Natacha.

 ,
Looks like you are using the model optimizer correctly, we had a previous report of a similar issue on our Intel Community. User reported the issue being solved by using a TensorFlow branch prior to July 1st. Could you give that a try?
See discussion here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Distribution-of-OpenVINO/TF-ssdv2-to-IRv10-error-quot-Preprocessor-mul-quot-has-2/td-p/1189093&gt;https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Distribution-of-OpenVINO/TF-ssdv2-to-IRv10-error-quot-Preprocessor-mul-quot-has-2/td-p/1189093&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes, I also trained the model using a prior version to July 1st of TF Obj Det API and even other prior versions (2 years ago). Unfortunately, I get the same error, so it is very strange.
Best,
Natacha.

I apologies for the delay for some reason I missed the notification. Could you provide your TensorFlow model?

No problem. Yes I can share the model. Where do you want that I send the Tensorflow model ?
Best,

Thanks for sending over the model, I took a look and it seems there are changes to the order of applying input image normalization and resizing images. The dev team is already looking into this issue, however, I don't have an ETA on fix yet.

 ,
please, use the MO from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/3063&gt;#3063&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and let me know if the solution works for you.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lazarevevgeny&gt;@lazarevevgeny&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks ! I tested. The conversion to OpenVino works but unforthunately not the inferences ... I obtain no detections. The prediction vector is always [-1, 0, 0, 0, ...0, 0]. When I run inferences with Tensorflow I obtain mutliple detections. And when I use OpenVino with models not from the TF API I obtain detections.
Best,
Natacha.

 , could you share the sample image with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jgespino&gt;@jgespino&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the model you shared with him?

Yes, sure. For the inferences, I use the test images of HollywoodHead database available on &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/headdetection/&gt;https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/headdetection/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I hope it answer to your question.

Natacha.

 , I did the following using MO and IE from the master branch (commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/commit/f4d399f471d93366cf023bde939be73b4c293a93&gt;f4d399f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
):

./mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --transformation extensions/front/tf/ssd_support_api_v1.15.json --tensorflow_object_detection pipeline.config  --reverse_input_channels

Pay attention to the "--reverse_input_channels" in the command line.
Then I used the object_detection_sample_ssd:

./object_detection_sample_ssd -m frozen_inference_graph.xml -i casablanca_074268.jpeg

And I see the detections:
