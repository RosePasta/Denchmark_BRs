	<summary>Error using webcam for text detection demo</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenVINO =&gt; 2020.1
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu 18.04.5

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am attempting to run the following OpenVINO model demo using the command:
./text_detection_demo -m_tr /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader/intel/text-recognition-0012/FP32/text-recognition-0012.xml -i /dev/video0 -r
When I run a text detection demo using a sample image uploaded on the computer, the demo successfully runs; however when I attempt to use my webcam, I get the following error:
InferenceEngine: 	API version ......... 2.1

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/manetelpian&gt;@manetelpian&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for reaching out. Please try giving the index number of the device instead of the actual video device. For example in your case for input try  instead of . Give this a try, I am confident this should resolve the issue you are observing, let me know the outcome.
Regards,
Luis

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avitial&gt;@avitial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , it worked! Thank you. I do have a new issue now:
./interactive_face_detection_demo: error while loading shared libraries: libopencv_highgui.so.4.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Does this relate to the one I have before?
Thanks again.

 glad it worked!
For this other issue, could you share the full command when running the interactive_face_detection_demo? Are you using the webcam or a video file as input?

		I am using the webcam as input.
Here is the command I use to run the demo.
./interactive_face_detection_demo -i 0 -r -m /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader/intel/face-detection-adas-0001/FP32/face-detection-adas-0001.xml -m_ag /opt/intel/openvino_2021/deployment_tools/open_model_zoo/tools/downloader/intel/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013/FP32/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013.xml
Thanks!

 I am not able to see such error, I'd suggest to double check the environment variables are set (run setupvars.bat). Are you using your own build of OpenCV or the one included in the OpenVINO package?
