	<summary>Conflicts between tensorflow dependencies while installing DeepHyper on GPU</summary>
	<description>
I am reporting an issue shared by a user:

I installed DeepHyper on V100 GPUs. It installs Tensorflow 1.15 and Tensorflow-gpu 2.2.0 by default, these versions conflict each other for Tensorboard and Tensorflow estimator. So I uninstalled TF-GPU 2.2.0 and installed TF-GPU 1.15.

We should edit the  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deephyper/deephyper/blob/master/setup.py#L62&gt;code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)

		This solution is effective when installing from source but not with pip install.
