	<summary>Error for histogram visualization  (Expected binary or unicode string, got)?</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I am using pytorch 0.4.1. And I installed the lastest tensorboardX. I can call writer.add_histogram successfully. But when I use tensorboard to visualize it. It gives me the TypeError:Expected binary or unicode string, got .
A minimal example to reproduce the error is:
import numpy as np
from tensorboardX import SummaryWriter
writer = SummaryWriter(log_dir='./log')
v = np.random.uniform(0, 5, (64,3,7,7))
writer.add_histogram('x', v, 0, bins='sqrt')
Note: I installed tensorflow 1.10 as well.

		I just confirmed the bug (with tensorboard 1.9.0) and will look into this.
a quick work around would be removing the bins argument.
writer.add_histogram('x', v, 0)

		That was a horrible bug. Thanks for the report.

		This still happens with SummaryWriter with TB 1.12.0 and TBX 1.2.

		Wait, it's the version on pypi that is outdated, can you update it?
