	<summary>Does `add_embedding` support word embedding with metadata that has an header?</summary>
	<description>
When I try to use  for my word embeddings the following assertion is raised: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch/blob/master/tensorboardX/writer.py#L445&gt;"#labels should equal with #data points"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However, according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/embedding#metadata&gt;tensorboard documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 the metadata can have one additional row: the header.
As a test, I've commented out line 445 and it works without any issue. I was able to visualize my word embeddings in Tensorboard.

		Hi, my code is based on the assumption in tensorboard doc:
 If the TSV metadata file has only a single column, then we donâ€™t expect a header row, and assume each row is the label of the embedding. We include this exception because it matches the commonly-used "vocab file" format.
Maybe your header message is hiding in your visualization lol.

		implemented in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX/pull/110&gt;#110&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
