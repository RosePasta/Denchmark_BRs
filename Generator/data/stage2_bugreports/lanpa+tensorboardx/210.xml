TensorboardX version: 1.4.0.

		In _prepare_image(I) function, it assumes that the ndarray is ordered as [N]CHW.

		Same problem here, a breaking change occured in june with this PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX/pull/156&gt;#156&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I don't mind the breakage, but it should at least go with documentation.

		Got it. We need a more comprehensive unit test to prevent that happen again.
