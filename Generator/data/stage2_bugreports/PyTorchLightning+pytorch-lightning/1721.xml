		If the goal is to keep the cache to speed things up, my suggestion would be to add a couple checks in the "Install dependencies" step in the workflow:

Check the version of torch before installing requirements.txt, save in Bash variable.
Install requirements.txt
Check the version of torch after, save in Bash variable.
If torch version before != version after, then uninstall Horovod.
Install requirements-extra.txt.

This way, we should be able to leverage the cache to speed things up when nothing changes, without running into incompatibilities when the torch version is upgraded.
I can put together a PR for this.

 PR would be great!
I am a bit suspicions as you mentioned that the cache is not loaded properly so thinking about opening an issue with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/actions/cache&gt;https://github.com/actions/cache&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I see the issue now, the problem is that the min requirement of  is the actual one so the loaded cache even with  is satisfied
