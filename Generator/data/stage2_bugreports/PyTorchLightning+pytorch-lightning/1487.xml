		You need to install wandb package first.
pip install  wandb

		Guess it would be helpful if there was a error displayed suggesting to install the logger package while importing. I had this same issue while using comet logger and wasn't sure what was wrong.

I had this same issue while using comet logger and wasn't sure what was wrong.

Actually I opened my code in vs code, and after that, I installed wandb and did the logging. It needed a restart to the editor to setup wandb properly with my editor command line, and after the restart, the error was gone indeed. I guess that's what happened with you as well.
The issue is solved. Thanks to everyone for the quick response.
