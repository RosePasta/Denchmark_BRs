&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Run &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-_LKx4HwAxl5M6xPJmqAAu444LTDQoa3&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-_LKx4HwAxl5M6xPJmqAAu444LTDQoa3&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with 
There were other error when trying to run with other versions from ["1.5" , "20200325", "nightly"] neither of them seem to work properly, there's always some sort of bug that pops up.
at this one moment when i had finally got it to run the model, the second time i ran the cell, it crashed, could be that i had to free up mem. but i dont see why it shouldn't have been done automatically.

 It worked fine for me with nightly. Could you try it again with nightly? Do let me know if there's any bug that pops up with it.
