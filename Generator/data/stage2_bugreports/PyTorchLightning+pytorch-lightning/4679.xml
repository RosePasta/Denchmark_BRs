	<summary>If train_step returns None, callback_metrics is empty</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The title says it all: if, instead of returning a Tensor, I return None from train_step (w/ automatic_optimization=False, though I think this is irrelevant), then trainer.callback_metrics is not populated and is empty during the callbacks.
It's weird that these two things are associated, they seem very different parts of the codebase.
Expected: callback_metrics is populated in the same way regardless of return value of training_step. If returning None is not valid, an error should be raised.

		Can you try to see if this issue persists on master?

		I experience the same behavior on 1.0.7. Same setup where automatic_optimization=False.
Can be mitigated by returning {} (empty dict) in training_step, though it definitely looks like a bug.

 I was not able to reproduce using master (see this &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14j-13Ij-fsbKQKPa7kxeD5SgOu1qGLTI?usp=sharing&gt;notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Can one of you check if master have indeed solved the problem?

 thanks for confirming. Then please update to master, or wait for next release. Closing this issue.
