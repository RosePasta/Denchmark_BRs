	<summary>Fix .test() on ddp</summary>
	<description>
This might be broken on notebooks only.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/875&gt;#875&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 solves a few problems with .test()
However, ddp + .test might be broken on notebooks because of the "spawn" option. (likely &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/747&gt;#747&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		I am investigating this. Thats how I ran into the spawn issue with shared Q's. I am not using a notebook. This is (I believe) because ddp reduces tensors and parameters back to dev_ids[0] and there is no obvious way to get them back to the spawning CPU. I am slowly making progress, but don't have a lot of consistent time to put in.

		Isn't ddp broken in notebooks in the first place?
