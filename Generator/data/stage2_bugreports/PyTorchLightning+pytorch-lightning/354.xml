	<summary>Progress bar no longer shows total iterations</summary>
	<description>
This seems to have been introduced in master sometime recently. tqdm doesn't seem be be getting total set, so there's no progress bar or time to completion estimate. All we get is this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;374it [00:07, 50.48it/s, batch_nb=372, epoch=0, loss=0.801, some_val=1.25, v_nb=0]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This seems to be the culprit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/pull/345/files#diff-0cd7170e96efa4a55577086f5db2fe4cR1058&gt;https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/pull/345/files#diff-0cd7170e96efa4a55577086f5db2fe4cR1058&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon&gt;@williamFalcon&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Was that line needed for some reason, or did some debug code just slip in?

		Bah, link didn't point to where I wanted it to. The relevant code line in trainer.py is
            # limit the number of batches to 1 in fast_dev_run
            self.total_batches = 1

		oh yeah... that's a bug.
Ok, fixed on master.
This is a critical bug, so I'm going to do a minor release. Should be the last release until nov 6... these latest ones just had a few major issues.
