	<summary>Issue with multi gpu dp backend</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I tried to run gpu_template.py from basic_examples but I get an error that says Fatal Python error:Aborted (screenshot below). I am able to use ddp but not dp. Did anyone else face this issue?

		what versions are you running?
how are you running it? (cluster?, interactive mode?)
Do you have 2 gpus.
But as an FYI, Lightning has tests for dp, and all is fine there. This sounds like an environment config issue or an issue in your code which may not be being correctly propagated through the error chain.

		Update - The same code worked when I ran it today. Don't know what the issue might have been.
Versions -
pytorch-lightning: 0.5.2.1
test-tube: 0.7.1
torch: 1.3.0
I'm running it on a cluster in interactive mode. It has 2 gpus.
