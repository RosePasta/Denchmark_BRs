	<summary>When auto_sceale_batch_size and auto_lr_find are both enabled, lr find is called with every batch search</summary>
	<description>
is this a bug or feature? I think lr find should be called after batch size search is done.

 this is definitely a bug, it should be added to the list of attributes that are stored and altered before the search and then restored after the search:


I will send a bugfix.
