	<summary>Indefinite hang when attempting to run tests</summary>
	<description>
Running the tests in two different environments both hang (though at different spots). Relevant to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/2041&gt;Issue 2041&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Repro 1 (on Docker with pytorch pre-installed)

Code and results found in this PR
Run make pytorch-lightning which does the following

Set up Docker Image (commands in Dockerfile)

Clone v0.9.0
Install cmake and requirements


Run the tests (commands in Makefile)


Results: hangs on tests/loggers/test_all.py::test_logger_created_on_rank_zero_only

Repro 2 (in CentOS 8 without Docker, on CLI)

Clone v0.9.0: git clone --branch 0.9.0 https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning
Install cmake and requirements: pip install cmake &amp;&amp; pip install --requirement requirements/base.txt --quiet --upgrade
Install some more requirements: HOROVOD_BUILD_ARCH_FLAGS="-mfma" pip install --requirement ./requirements/devel.txt --quiet --upgrade
Run the tests: coverage run --source pytorch_lightning -m pytest pytorch_lightning tests -v --durations=0 --junitxml=junit/test-results-centos-3.8.xml
Hangs on pytorch_lightning/loggers/neptune.py::pytorch_lightning.loggers.neptune.NeptuneLogger
Note: this issue also occurs on master, not just v0.9.0

I think this is different, long tests and infinitely hanging...
Are you using a base docker image so I can reproduce?

 mind shareing your environment, because I do not see any hanging tests on master these days...

		Just run it on two machines and could not replicate, so I'll close it now... Also, the integration PR was merged fine
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/janeyx99&gt;@janeyx99&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 feel free to reopen if needed, but we can fix only master, not past releases...
