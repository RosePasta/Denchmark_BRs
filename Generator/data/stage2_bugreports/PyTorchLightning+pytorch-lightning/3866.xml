	<summary>Unusual printing statements after 90% epoch completition</summary>
	<description>
i've encountered this unusual print statements while training
It seems that this printing starts when epoch is 90% complete and both loss and train_loss is same until 100% completition
This behaviour is same on TPU's as well as on GPU's

		Colab and pycharm has this kind of issue, I guess.
The main progress bar is the combination of train dataloder + val dataloader (if exist)
If you run the python file as normal python script in colab and your train dataloader takes 90% of the (train + val) dataloader, it will show up like this once it reaches validation step. B/C I used to run like that.
This is not a lightning issue, it's tqdm.
This is also same with pycharm but I am not so sure about that.
