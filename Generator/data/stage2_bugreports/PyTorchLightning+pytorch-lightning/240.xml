	<summary>Trainer.restore_weights takes a model, but never uses it</summary>
	<description>
In line with the discussion on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/169&gt;#169&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , while digging through the code trying to figure out how to load a model when I don't have a meta_tags.csv (I'm hitting exp.save(), but that file never shows up, just a "meta.experiment" file), I discovered the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/blob/87708157bc1c8f69ccfe5401b75d227348f56dfe/pytorch_lightning/trainer/trainer_io.py#L24&gt;Trainer.restore_weights(self, model)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 function. It crashed when I tried to use it, though, because the  argument never gets used, and instead it just calls , which gets the model from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning/blob/87708157bc1c8f69ccfe5401b75d227348f56dfe/pytorch_lightning/trainer/trainer_io.py#L132&gt;Trainer.__get_model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It seems like either the model shouldn't be asked for, or it ought to be used, not sure which is better in this case.

		I'm actually running into this while trying to figure out how to use .test() because, again, there's no meta_tags.csv file and thus I can't use the load_from_metrics function. It's frustrating because I can call .fit(model) and the model loads from the latest checkpoint, everything resets to where it was, and we're good, but .test() doesn't do any of that (and probably shouldn't), but figuring out how to load the model from a checkpoint without a meta_tags.csv file is tricky.

		good points. i think we have an issue already for cleaning up the load function. if you want to take a crack at it, weâ€™d love the PR!
Otherwise I can look into it after next week
