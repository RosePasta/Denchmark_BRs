	<summary>val_dataloader gets reloaded twice when num_sanity_val_steps &amp;gt; 0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

val_dataloader gets called during sanity check and then again in the actual validation later on.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

gets only instantiated once (unless reload dataloaders every epoch = True)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

From report on slack

		oh sorry! missed that. i was just in that part of the code with refactors, so it was a quick fix and also didn't want to have merge conflicts
