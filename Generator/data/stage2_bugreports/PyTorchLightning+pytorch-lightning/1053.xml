	<summary>Error: object has no attribute 'num_train_imgs' in version master, but not 0.6.0</summary>
	<description>
I am running on Ubuntu 18, and trying to run the vq_vae.yaml config from this package:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE&gt;https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It runs fine under version 0.6.0 with python 3.7 but when I update to lighting-master (0.6.1)  I get this error:
AttributeError: 'VAEXperiment' object has no attribute 'num_train_imgs'
The relevant .py file is attached:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/files/4294201/experiment.zip&gt;experiment.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is there a change-log that would tell me what might be wrong since AntixK wrote this package for 0.6.0 and I'd like to use it with Apex, which isn't supported on 0.6.0

		Hrm. I get the same error with the new master. If you are curious to know more about my base, here is my pip freeze and I'm using Python version 3.7 when this happens.

When I use python 3.6, I get this error whether I am using lightning 060 or 070.

Thanks for working so hard on Lightning.  I really like the idea.  I've created a similar package for systematizing  psychophysics experiments and it's been tremendously useful.  Getting the right balance of customization vs structure is hard to do and I think you've done it very well.

		I was able to fix this problem.  It seems that the way antixk had structured his base experiment file was to assume that train_dataloader would be called prior to validation.  However in 0.7.0, maybe you don't do this anymore?

Here's what allowed the code to run:
