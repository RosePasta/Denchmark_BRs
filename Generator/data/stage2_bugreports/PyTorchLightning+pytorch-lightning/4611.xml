	<summary>self.log does not work in on_train_batch_start/end hooks</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Logging with self.log doesn't seem to work properly in the on_train_batch_start and on_train_batch_end model hooks. Specifically:

when put in on_train_batch_start it crashes because self._current_fx_name is set to validation_epoch_endwhich seems like incorrect behaviour. (It seems like it should be set to training_step)
when put in on_train_batch_end it just seems to never log anything (the example I wrote tries to log to the progress bar but nothing is logged). It is also not present in tensorboard when I run this code locally.

Is this intended behaviour? The docs suggest that self.log might only work in (training|validation)_step_(end)? methods, but it also says explicitly that self.log can be called from anywhere in the module. If this is the intended behaviour then I think the documentation could be clarified.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

See colab
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the colab, both metric1 and metric2 should appear in the progress bar, but only metric1 does. metric2 is logged in on_train_batch_start (similar results occur with on_train_batch_end)

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AustinT&gt;@AustinT&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for reporting this behaviour. After looking into it, this feature was added recently on master branch only.
