	<summary>batch size finder does not recognize flag and seems to download often</summary>
	<description>
the --auto_scale_batch_size flag requires a string. But it should also just work with set_true

ie: support this case:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;--auto_scale_batch_size
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


it seems to trigger data downloads more frequently?

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Files already downloaded and verified
