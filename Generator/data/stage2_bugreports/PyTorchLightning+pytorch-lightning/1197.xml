&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ModelCheckpoint class attempts to save a model file on every batch run.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've created a simple trainer with a checkpoint, passing save_best_k=-1. My trainer only has a training step configured.
The model checkpoint class is being called at the end of each batch run here - 


pytorch-lightning/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py


         Line 741
      in
      732eaee






 self.checkpoint_callback.on_validation_end(self, self.get_model()) 





This seems to be because train_step_only flag is active in my case, and the relevant code that triggers the model save is here - 


pytorch-lightning/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py


         Line 457
      in
      732eaee






 self.call_checkpoint_callback()

		I tested it on the latest master branch and cannot reproduce what you described. It looks like this was fixed (the train_step_only variable is not there anymore). Can you confirm this?
