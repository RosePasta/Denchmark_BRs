	<summary>wandLogger().name is None in DDP mode</summary>
	<description>
If you remove &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/8ca8336ce52ee7379f4d399520636143eb31018b/pytorch_lightning/trainer/callback_config.py#L54&gt;line 54&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, everything works.
When you're not in ddp mode, this is not an issue.

 it is caused by missing 


which comes from the wrong  init


Do you have a minimal example which we can add among tests?

		Unfortunately I do not, the problem was encountered with
Trainer(distributed_backend="ddp",  logger=WandbLogger(name='hello'))
So if you put that wherever you guys test ddp, it should suffice.

		I will try to write a test that (ideally for all loggers) makes sure the logger is only used in rank 0 process, therefore not creating any files on rank &gt; 0 and then I can also make sure these NoneTypeErrors don't happen on rank &gt; 0.
