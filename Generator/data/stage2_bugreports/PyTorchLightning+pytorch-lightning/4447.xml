	<summary>In 1.0.4, training_step is never called when optimizer_step is overriden</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Something changed from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4: in 1.0.3 I was able to override optimizer_step in my LightningModule and everything worked fine. But in 1.0.4, when I override optimizer_step it causes training_step to be skipped.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Please reproduce using the BoringModel and post here&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HvWVVTK8j2Nj52qU4Q4YCyzOm0_aLQF3?usp=sharing&gt;BoringModel replication&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Defining optimizer_step should not cause training_step to be skipped over. This is definitely a problem.

		Also ran into this bug. Fixed in my case by passing optimizer.step the optimizer_closure, as they do in LightningModule &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/9cfd29946a308526cee088c176a2285e6752453c/pytorch_lightning/core/lightning.py#L1216&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks, that seems to be working. If this is going to be the required way of handling it (unlike in previous releases) then I think it needs to be clearly pointed out in the documentation. Otherwise, hopefully it can be fixed before the next maintenance update.

		yes, I think the docs are a bit old, I am updating them in the fix. Apart from that just making sure that passing optimizer_closure is the only issue here.

		This should be closed, the docs have been cleared up in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/4455&gt;#4455&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, ensuring that users know to pass the optimizer_closure to the optimizer.
