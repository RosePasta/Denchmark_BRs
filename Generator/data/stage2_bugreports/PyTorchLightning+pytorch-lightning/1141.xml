	<summary>IterableDataset Issue, OverflowError: cannot convert float infinity to integer</summary>
	<description>
Hey all,
I am very new to ML and PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, so if this is a simple problem sorry to bother.
However, I am struggling to switch from PyTorch to PyTorch Lightning. The PyTorch code runs with no error on Google Colab hence I think that the structure is fine.
Now I am trying to implement Lightning following: &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://towardsdatascience.com/from-pytorch-to-pytorch-lightning-a-gentle-introduction-b371b7caaf09&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

These are the link to my codes:
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/ykukkim/MLevent/blob/master/final_model.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, 
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/ykukkim/MLevent/blob/master/lightningtest.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
However, I get the following error and it seems that this is to do with IterableDataset. As my datasets are imbalance, meaning that I do not have a constant length of the dataset as well as there are more 0’s than 1’s, approximately 100:1, hence I need to penalise the 0’s by multiplying it with an arbitrary number.
I guess that this issue has been raised a few times, and I am not too sure whether there is a general fix or I have to play around with my dataset.

		Hi, thanks for the issue! Can you confirm if the error is there using the most recent version on master (i.e. if you install from github)? We only added support for IterableDatasets quite recently

		Hi, Thank you for your reply.
I am very new to this, I am using conda3 and used pip to install lightning package which is installed in conda enviroment.
Could you perhaps explain a bit more about your suggestion as to how to do it?

		No worries, just try installing with the bleeding-edge instructions &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PytorchLightning/pytorch-lightning#bleeding-edge&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and run your code again :)

		Thanks this works!
trainer = pl.Trainer(val_check_interval = 100,gpus=None)
I did the val_check interval, but I am not too sure what it does? Could you care to explain this to me by any chance?
Thank you!
