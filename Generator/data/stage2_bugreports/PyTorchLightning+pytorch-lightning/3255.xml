	<summary>NeptuneLogger creates multiple experiments in DDP mode</summary>
	<description>
Currently, the Neptune logger creates multiple experiments when started with DDP.
I believe the reason is that the experiment is created within the constructor:
self._experiment = self._create_or_get_experiment()
This happens in each of the processes. I think the solution is to simple set this to None and let the property experiment function create the experiment.
