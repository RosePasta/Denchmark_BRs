	<summary>training_epoch_end seems to fail when returning nothing</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to log weight histograms to tensorboard at the end of each training epoch. I have the following code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    def training_epoch_end(self, outputs):
        self.log_hists()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is in line with the documentation. "If you don't need to display anything, Don't return anything"
However when this function runs I get the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;...
File "/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py", line 499, in run_training_epoch
│    self.run_training_epoch_end(epoch_output)
│  File "/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py", line 533, in run_training_epoch_end
│    _processed_outputs = self.process_output(epoch_output)
│  File "/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/logging.py", line 106, in process_output

│  File "/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tqdm/std.py", line 1433, in format_dict
│TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable```

The fix that I've found is to return a dictionary according to the expected typed return, as follows:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def training_epoch_end(self, outputs):
    self.log_hists()
    return {'dummy': torch.Tensor()}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
This seems like a bandaid rather than a true fix since I don't need to return anything.

1) Is there a better way to log the histograms to tensorboard?
2) Should I be doing something different in this function?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		training_epoch_end by default doesn't log histogram.
If you want to plot histogram on tensorboard, try self.logger.experiment.add_histogram().
It's &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/experiment_logging.html#tensorboard&gt;the docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
PL supports every method of  class with .

		Thanks Jeff!

The log_hists function that I have in the example is logging the entire the
model weights, the biases and the gradients and it does use the referenced
method.  Is the fact that if I don't return something from the function a
bug or user error?

 sorry for the delayed reply, currently we need to return empty dict in  to make it work. But, Lightning will be supporting  in the future.

 are we going to support return None?
