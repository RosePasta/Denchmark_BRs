	<summary>ModelCheckpoint Filepath Doesn't Use Logger Save Dir</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Not sure if this is intended, but the model checkpoint isn't using the same directory as the logger, even if the logger exists. I would have expected this line &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/588ad8377167c0b7d29cf4f362dbf42015f7568d/pytorch_lightning/trainer/callback_config.py#L28&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to be  instead of .
Thank you,
-Collin

		I am running into the same issue and feel like I must be doing something wrong. If I do not define a logger and checkpoint callback, the logger and checkpoint are saved in a clear structure under lightning_logs. But if I do provide them, it turns out to be difficult to get Lightning to follow that same structure. If I use lightning_logs as filepath I get the warning that that directory already exists and that my existing checkpoints will be overwritten.

		Were you able to find the checkpoints? I cant seem to find them anywhere!

		The checkpoints are currently being saved to a subfolder of the current working directory. If you print the current working directory at the top of our file with print(os.getcwd()) that should tell you where to find them.

		FWIW, using the default checkpoint_callback, the checkpoint is not in default location. Still looking for it! Though no more default checkpoint_callback for me ...
