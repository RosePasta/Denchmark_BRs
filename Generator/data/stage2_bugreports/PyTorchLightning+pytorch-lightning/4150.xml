	<summary>Accuracy metric throwing out-of-range value (&amp;gt;1)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using class-based metrics.Accuracy(num_classes) with a fixed number of classes calculated in train and eval step outputs accuracy bigger than one.
Epoch 11:   2%|‚ñè         | 66/2775 [02:00&lt;1:22:17,  1.82s/it, loss=2.367, v_num=1, train_loss=2.36, train_acc=1.67, val_loss=2.41, val_acc=1.27]
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The issue appears inconsistently.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Accuracy should be a value between 0 and 1.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


PyTorch Version (e.g., 1.0): 1.6.0
OS (e.g., Linux): Ubuntu
How you installed PyTorch (conda, pip, source): Conda
Python version: 3.8.5
Pytorch-lightning version: 0.9.0
Any other relevant information: I'm using multi-gpu with ddp

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm getting these warnings from the accuracy metric:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/miniconda3/envs/py385/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/utilities/distributed.py:37: UserWarning: You have set 32 number of classes if different from predicted (4) and target (29) number of classes
  warnings.warn(*args, **kwargs)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Actually I just wanted to report it even if I don't have a reproduce because I didn't see any other reports of this.
Maybe accuracy should have a warning in these cases, but I have no clue where this out-of-bounds value is coming from in the first place.
Meanwhile, I'll switch to an ad-hoc accuracy calculation to check if the problem persists.

		PyTorch Lightning 1.0 has a new accuracy metric that is correctly implemented and rigorously tested, I would recommend updating to that.

		Okay, I'll update and keep informed if the issue persists.
