	<summary>EarlyStopping mode auto is unknown, fallback to auto mode.</summary>
	<description>
In the process of refactoring as I upgraded lighting and it looks like there's been a slight change to the callback interface.
This code:
early_stop_callback = pl.callbacks.EarlyStopping(verbose=True)
Results in the message:

EarlyStopping mode auto is unknown, fallback to auto mode.
EarlyStopping mode set to min for monitoring early_stop_on.

The default for mode is 'auto' so the first message doesn't make sense

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/david-waterworth&gt;@david-waterworth&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for using Pytorch Lightning and finding this bug !
I think it should be this way.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;EarlyStopping mode not provided, fallback to auto mode.
...
EarlyStopping mode set to min for monitoring early_stop_on.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Best regards,
Thomas Chaton.
