	<summary>prepare_data called multiple times per node for slurm and elastic training</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Slurm and elastic training create the training processes per node outside of the lightning context. This means that when the fit function calls prepare_data, the assumption that it's only being called on proc 0 is broken and it gets called for each process.
This is an issue computational reasons (e.g. downloading a whole dataset) and for training stability if the data preparation process isn't deterministic.
See calling code here:



pytorch-lightning/pytorch_lightning/trainer/trainer.py


         Line 825
      in
      7c7e50c






 model.prepare_data() 





&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Add print statements to prepare_data
Train a lightning model with either slurm or elastic training
See that it's being called multiple times.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Expected prepare_data to only be called once per node.
