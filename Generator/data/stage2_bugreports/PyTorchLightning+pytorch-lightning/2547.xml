	<summary>Can't use None (anymore) in checkpoint_callback</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

using None in checkpoint_callback now errors out
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- Process 0 terminated with the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/multiprocessing/spawn.py", line 20, in _wrap

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'best_model_path'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

trainer = Trainer(checkpoint_callback=None)
Ran into this issue from upgrading to masters, was using masters from a few commits ago before
Edit: False casuses the same error as well

 I saw that this issue was mentioned and supposedly fixed in the merge, but I just tested with master and I'm still getting the same error

This is the error I get when I set checkpoint_callback to false on master (0.9.0rc6)
Edit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/compare/master...s-rog:patch-1&gt;master...s-rog:patch-1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 simple enough change I suppose... unless I'm missing something?

 I think your proposed fix is good. In case user sets checkpoint_callback to None, we should not try to set a path there.
