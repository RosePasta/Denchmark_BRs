	<summary>early stopping callback on_epoch_end called twice</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;What is your question?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am confused on the early stopping behavior. The  method seems to get called 2 times after a single validation epoch. It is called first from here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/v0.7.5.x/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py#L453&gt;https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/v0.7.5.x/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py#L453&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and next from here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/v0.7.5.x/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py#L363&gt;https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/v0.7.5.x/pytorch_lightning/trainer/training_loop.py#L363&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. This results in  in  getting called I believe incorrectly. I.e what is happening is the current metric is checked, then it is checked immediately again and since it has not changed self.wait is incremented.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Code&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am passing this into the trainer
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;early_stop_callback = EarlyStopping(
        monitor='validation_mean_precision',
        min_delta=0.00,
        patience=3,
        verbose=True,
        mode='max'
    )
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;What's your environment?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		That is an issue in 0.7.6.
There are multiple issues with this issue as well and it should be fixed in the next release.
As a workaround for 0.7.6 you can double the number of patience to get the expected behavior.

		Yes, I noticed the same issue. I tried modifying the EarlyStopping logic by replacing the on_epoch_end() hook with on_validation_end(), but it is never called inside the training loop.
I think there should be a validation_epoch_end() hook like in LightningModule.

 early stopping seems to work correctly in 0.8.0rc2. But in my mind this is a major bug in 0.7.6

		well as v0.8.0 will be released shortly, we will not prepare any further fixes in v0.7.x but if you want and send a fix PR we can arrange it for you in v0.7.6.x branch üê∞
