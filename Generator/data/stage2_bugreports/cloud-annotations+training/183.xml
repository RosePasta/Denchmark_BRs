	<summary>model_web folder does not have a model file</summary>
	<description>
After downloading, the "model_web" folder does not have a model. It only has "labels.json."
However, the "model", "model_ios", and "model_android" folders all have their corresponding models.

		I just released a few updates, let me double check I didn‚Äôt break anything. Do you mind sharing the training-logs.txt file?

		Things look okay on my end. How many images did you label and how many labels?

		<comment id='3' author='TheFeed' date='2020-01-10T02:53:23Z'>
		

No problem. Attached is the training log.
training-log.txt


~150 images with 4 labels. The labels were all different in quantity, some were only used about 50% of the time while others were in every image.

		so it should be using these versions:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tensorflow-1.14
tensorflowjs-0.8.0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I double check that the versions are compatible
Would it be possible to send the model folder? I can try converting it manually

		Here is a Google Drive link with the model folder:

		I tried training again and got the same error, I'm bumping the tensorflow.js converter version which should hopefully fix the issue ü§û

		In the meantime you can try running:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cacli train --frameworkv 1.12
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This should be fixed now, update to cacli v1.2.26 please reopen if you're still experiencing the issue

		I am using cacli version 1.2.26 and I have trained something around 330 images with 2 labels.
I run the command for training cacli train and cacli download &lt;MODEL_ID&gt; --tfjs --coreml --tflite but as a result I have downloaded a folder with only model_android and model_ios, the folder model_web is missing.

 If you run cacli download without the flags does it still not download the model_web folder?

 did you happen to train the model with an older version of cacli and just try to download it with the newer version?

 yes I confirm I also trained the model with the newer version of cacli.
I tried running the download without flags, among the models there are

model_android
model_ios
model (not model_web)

But in the  folder the model.json is missing.
I have uploaded the entire downloaded folder at the following link: &lt;denchmark-link:https://ibm.box.com/s/0uzl6cstrwbc7ugsvkft6werdej4nkmb&gt;https://ibm.box.com/s/0uzl6cstrwbc7ugsvkft6werdej4nkmb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Can you run ‚Äúcacli logs model-id‚Äù and see if there are any errors?

		At the end of the logs there is this message

Aside from that there is a series of Warning, but nothing that says "error"

		In the meantime, do you mind trying to train from the GUI and see if you have the same issue?

		I think I might have forgotten to push one of the changes in the release, I'll run some tests and keep you posted

		I downloaded the latest version and I trained again the dataset and now I can see the model_web directory along with the model.json.
Thanks for your help!
