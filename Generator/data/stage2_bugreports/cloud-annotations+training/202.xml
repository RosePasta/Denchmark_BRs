	<summary>[training failure] Backend response timeout (30s)</summary>
	<description>
First, training with web app:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40022306/75624966-39d0f500-5bc2-11ea-82aa-ae52a5e6877f.JPG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Then training with cacli:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ cacli train

Bucket panels-01

⠏ Starting training run... error Backend response timeout (30s)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ cacli list

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ cacli logs model-1qn1nzc4

		That error shouldn't have anything to do with your data. I think I've seen that error before when my bucket endpoint had a typo when I was manually testing the api, but the endpoint is autogenerated for you, so you shouldn't have to worry about that.
Do you know what region your bucket is in?

		I am on the Lite plans for now, and I just selected the defaults for services. From IBM cloud:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Services(1)
Machine Learning-2z    Default    London    Machine Learning    Active

Storage(1)
Cloud Object Storage-vz    Default    Global    Cloud Object Storage    Provisioned
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, my panels-01 bucket is in us-geo location with this endpoint s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud. I don't think I could have selected an European location with the Lite plan.

		I think I found the problem.
The machine learning service is set to London location by default, while the storage is in the US.
I deleted the ML service and created a new one in Dallas location, I am no longer getting the error , the message now says "Waiting for an available GPU (this may take a while)..." which seems to be normal.

 That's good to know! I will look into if using buckets in another region effect training, or if there is just an issue with the London region of Watson Machine Learning.
If it says Waiting for an available GPU (this may take a while)... that means the training job was successfully submitted :)

		I believe the issue is with the WML London instance, I'm not able to get any bucket to train with a london instance

		The issue with London has been resolved, training should work now :)
