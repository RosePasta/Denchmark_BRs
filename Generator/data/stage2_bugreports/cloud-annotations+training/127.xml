		I noticed this in the log:
ValueError: Image format not JPEG
101 training and 44 validation examples.
CACLI-TRAINING-FAILED
Training exited with error code 1
Failed: learner_exit_code: 1
.. And there were PNGs in the bucket.
A subsequent training with only jpegs allows download of model.
Suggest mentioning this in the "Preparing Training Data" section of the tutorial.

		Hmm I wasn’t aware PNGs weren’t supported, either way I believe the cloud annotations tool stores all the images as jpgs, did you upload images to your bucket via another method? Also, it shouldn’t fail to train if an invalid file is present, if so that’s a bug that needs to be fixed

		Trainer raises the following error, but was supposed to be caught in a try catch that wasn't wrapping the right code. I'll push a fix
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if image.format != 'JPEG':
    raise ValueError('Image format not JPEG')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
