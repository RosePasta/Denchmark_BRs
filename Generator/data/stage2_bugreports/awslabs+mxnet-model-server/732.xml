	<summary>Batching</summary>
	<description>
Hey guys,
I'm setting up a face detection service and am currently using your SSD example as a baseline.
I've noticed that you have an assert here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/aa8f8a3473e6f06780ffd362fb8722a65affd380/examples/model_service_template/mxnet_model_service.py#L51&gt;https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/aa8f8a3473e6f06780ffd362fb8722a65affd380/examples/model_service_template/mxnet_model_service.py#L51&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

checking if the batch size is equal to 1
Does this mean I can not process multiple files at the same time?
More precisely, I would like to run an MTCNN service that detects all the faces in an image and then calll a Face Embedding service that computes all the embeddings of said faces.
Is it possible to batch the faces detected and compute the embeddings in one go?
I would like to know if it is just a matter of overloading the correct methods, ot if MMS does something clever in the background.
Thanks,
Miguel

		Following. Would be nice to have &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/tree/master/tensorflow_serving/batching&gt;a similar description &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
of how batching is handled like for tensorflow serving.

MMS support automatic batch the HTTP request. You can use management API to register a model with batch support: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/docs/management_api.md#register-a-model&gt;https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/docs/management_api.md#register-a-model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you enabled batch mode for your model, your custom service code will receive batched request. It's your service code's responsibility to batch then and send the batch request to engine. The example code didn't implement batch.
The the MTCNN case, it's different from batch feature the MMS is supporting.
MMS didn't restrict what you can do in your service code. You can achieve what you need by override the handle function.

 thanks for the quick response! That's what I suspected.
It would be nice however to have this feature highlighted somewhere as it is common practice with most model servers

 If we use the model-archiver utility to package our models, how should we set batch_size and max_batch_delay? Via the management API? If so, it is peculiar that they are not available for setting by the model archiver.

In current implementation, management API is the only way to set batch size.
Exposing more options in model-archiver tool is on our road map. This feature will come together with new model archive format spec.
We are working on document about batch support and will provide example models that support batch.

 should we add an example show casing how to use batched requests in your request handler code, and showcasing the performance boost?

 hi, may I ask how to change the model batch_size after starting the mms in the docker? when the mms starts in the docker, the model registered automatically, if I post a register request like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -v -X POST "http://localhost:8086/models?url=resnet.mar&amp;model_name=image_retrieval&amp;batch_size=30"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It'll return a message: "message": "Model image_retrieval is already registered.".
If I DELETE the register model, and register model with command:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -v -X POST "http://localhost:8086/models?initial_workers=1&amp;synchronous=true&amp;url=resnet.mar"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The model registered, but still can't change the batch_size, even I PUT a request:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -v -X PUT "http://localhost:8086/models/resnet?batch_size=30&amp;synchronous=true"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

it'll return:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;*   Trying ::1...

, could you please share what is the output of  after you tried to update its batch_size with POST request? I am trying to see what leads you to conclude that batch size is not updated.
Also, as a side note - you can set batch_size during register call (POST to /models endpoint). Consecutive calls to scale workers (PUT to /models/&lt;model_name&gt;) cannot change size of batch so you don't need that one.

 Thank you for your quick reply. Here is the return info after the POST request (I just post the request , not after DELETE the register model).

Here's curl "http://localhost:8086/models/image_retrieval" output:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If I DELETE the register model and POST again:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -v -X POST "http://localhost:8086/models?initial_workers=1&amp;batch_size=30&amp;synchronous=true&amp;url=resnet.mar&amp;model_name=image_retrieval"

So I want to register again, I can only POST curl -v -X POST "http://localhost:8086/models?initial_workers=1&amp;synchronous=true&amp;url=resnet.mar without batch_size and other argument.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;{

		Ok, I think what's happening when you DELETE model (unregister it by posting DELETE to /models/&lt;model_name&gt;) is that MMS actually deletes its model archive (.mar file) as well. You can confirm that by checking what is left in /opt/ml/model folder (or whatever is in your model_store setting) right after DELETE call.
So I think that is why your register attempt right after DELETE call fails. In order to do it cleanly, I suggest you DELETE model after container bounced and then register it by referring to url of the model where it actually exists (maybe on S3) so that MMS would have a strong link to where it could download model from. During this same POST call you can specify batch_size param.
I admit this is not the best experience for MMS users, but hopefully this workaround could be sufficient for now. Please let me know if this approach works for you.

		After some more digging around and reproducing issue I can confirm this is actually a bug with MMS. The call to register model with batch_size param works only if there is no synchronous parameter specified. So after DELETE of the model call like this: curl -X POST "localhost:8081/models?url=resnet50_ssd.mar&amp;model_name=resnet50&amp;batch_size=8&amp;initial_workers=4" works fine, but call like this curl -X POST "localhost:8081/models?url=resnet50_ssd.mar&amp;model_name=resnet50&amp;batch_size=8&amp;initial_workers=4&amp;synchronous=true"  fails with { "code": 404, "type": "ModelNotFoundException", "message": "Load failed... Deregistered model resnet50" }
We will prioritize this as a fix in near future. In the meantime you can use async approach to register model in order to change its batch size.

		I would also like to understand the behavior of MMS batching as it is not clear from the little description provided.
When setting a specific value X for batch size, does it mean the model server will only accept batch sizes of X or is it up to X, with X being an upper bound?
My goal is to have some servers accepting a variable number of samples at the same time, depending of what is available to be processed, so having an upper bound would be useful while having a fixed batch size, not so much.

 : We are in the process of writing a document. It will be out shortly. But, for now let me try to answer your questions here,

When setting a specific value X for batch size, does it mean the model server will only accept batch sizes of X or is it up to X, with X being an upper bound?

Short Answer : It is upto X messages. You get to choose the batch_size and the max_batch_delay for every model you register. Currently there is no way to configure these two params at startup. The max_batch_delay timer for a particular model starts when the model server receives the first inference request for that model and it keeps getting rescheduled as long as there are inference requests in the queue. If you receive X messages before max_batch_delay time expires, then the timer is switched off and the backend worker is given all the X messages. If you receive X-delta messages before max_batch_delay timeout, then the backend worker is given only X-delta messages.

 : I went through the logs you had sent. So the example models in our model zoo don't support batching by default.
. But, in the mean time to unblock you,

You are getting this error from your custom service code, here.
You have to modify the preprocess, inference and post process code to handle a list of requests.

MMS sends a list of inputs to the preprocess, seen &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/examples/model_service_template/mxnet_model_service.py#L99&gt;here as parameter named batch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Your model code should use this list of input requests to preprocess and send it to the inference method.

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vdantu&gt;@vdantu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and mms team, that's what we want, it really helps! Few days ago I stuck in how to handle number of requests which less than a batch, your padding method solved this problem! Thanks again!

 : Thats awesome :) . Really glad that the batching work we did helped. I could think of two options for variable batch size

Padding with 0's and ignoring this result on return path, or
Re-bind the network at every inference request.

Since this logic is in the inference path , i.e., re-bind would have to be done for every batch of request that comes in, it can quickly become very inefficient :) . So I chose to go with "padding with 0's" solution.

@radao
In current implementation, management API is the only way to set batch size.
Exposing more options in model-archiver tool is on our road map. This feature will come together with new model archive format spec.
We are working on document about batch support and will provide example models that support batch.

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/frankfliu&gt;@frankfliu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is there a way to contribute to configuring the batch size through the model spec? I'd be happy to help.

 , awesome to see your activities, keep 'em coming! :)
As for this particular question - could you please clarify what exactly you are trying to achieve? Describing it from user perspective would probably be the best way.

 Sure.
We're deploying a (set of) MMS servers using K8s, and it would be more friendly to operate if we could configure the batch settings directly within the model, rather than POSTing the model along with it's settings after deployment.
This makes things a lot easier from an operational standpoint, as POSTing to the model server is actually mutating the server's state. So, currently, if the server were to crash and K8s would spawn a new server pod, we'd have to reconfigure that pod again as it would boot into a "wrong" state. In contrast, if the batch size was set in the model archive, the server would boot directly into the desired state.

 : Thats a good feature to have as well. Could you have share a short writeup on what changes you were proposing?
IMO, there is a model section in the model-archive (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/model-archiver/model_archiver/manifest_components/model.py&gt;https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/model-archiver/model_archiver/manifest_components/model.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). This could be a good place for "max_batch_size", "max_batch_delay".
Frontend "Model.java" already has a copy of the ModelArchive, which contains Manifest with this Model.
