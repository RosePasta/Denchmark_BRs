	<summary>Failed download not handled</summary>
	<description>
If initial download fails, a partial file is created.  Retries to run just give error that the file isnâ€™t a zip file rather than checking the source, etc.  Maybe should be downloaded ad temp and flip-activate?  Or check with server that we have most recent file (date, size, etc.)?
