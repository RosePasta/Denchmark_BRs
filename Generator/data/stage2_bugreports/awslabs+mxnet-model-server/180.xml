	<summary>server ignores manifest entry for "Symbol"</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;What happens&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The server searches for the symbol file based on the "prefix" which is the "Model-Name" value in the manifest. It doesn't seem to use the "Symbol" value.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Expected result&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Intuitively, one would assume they can put whatever filename they want in the "Symbol" value, and have the server find it. We should not be restricted by that older notion of using a prefix.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Other expected result (related)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The intuitive interpretation of the values is the the "Model-Name" is the same as the name in "name=xyz.model" when you invoke the server. To the point where it would make sense to not even use name during invocation, just use the value in the manifest. This would be a good use of Model-Name since it doesn't make sense to have the prefix thing when we have specific values everywhere else.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Other potential issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It is likely there's a similar problem with the "Parameters" value, but that's untested.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Recreate it&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Recreate the issue by editing your manifests file's "Model" section:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    "Model": {
        "Parameters": "squeezenet_v1.1-0000.params",
        "Symbol": "squeezenet_v1.1-symbol.json",
        "Signature": "signature.json",
        "Description": "SqueezeNet v1.1",
        "Model-Format": "MXNet-Symbolic",
        "Model-Name": "squeezenet",
        "Service": "mxnet_vision_service.py"
    },
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Run the server and this will error with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(mxnet_p27) 8c8590217d26:dms markhama$ mxnet-model-server \
&gt;   --models squeezenet=squeezenet_v1.1.model
[14:32:33] /Users/travis/build/dmlc/mxnet-distro/mxnet-build/dmlc-core/include/dmlc/logging.h:308: [14:32:33] src/io/local_filesys.cc:166: Check failed: allow_null  LocalFileSystem: fail to open "/Users/markhama/Development/dms/squeezenet_v1.1/squeezenet-symbol.json"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The issue is narrowed in by updating "Model-Name" to have a prefix like that of the filename in "Symbol", so changing it like so:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    "Model-Name": "squeezenet_v1.1",
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Would allow the server to find the symbols file.
