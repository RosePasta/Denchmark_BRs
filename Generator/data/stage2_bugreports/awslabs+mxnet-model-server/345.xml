		The LSTM model is failing with this error:
[ERROR .../mxnet-model-server/mms/serving_frontend.py:predict_callback:472] Traceback (most recent call last): File ".../mxnet-model-server/mms/serving_frontend.py", line 468, in predict_callback response = modelservice.inference(input_data) File ".../mxnet-model-server/mms/model_service/model_service.py", line 101, in inference if self.model_name + '_LatencyPreprocess' in MetricsManager.metrics: AttributeError: 'MXNetLSTMService' object has no attribute 'model_name'

There is a problem with custom service file provided with the model in our model zoo. I have the fix and once I update model zoo, the error should be gone. Thanks for letting us know of the issue. Please let us know if yo find any other issue.

 Updated the model zoo and seems to work fine now.  Also, resnet_50_ssd_model is working fine now. So, closing the issue . Please feel free to reopen the issue or open a new one in case you find any errors.
