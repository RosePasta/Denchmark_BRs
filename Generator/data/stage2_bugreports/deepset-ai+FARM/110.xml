	<summary>Multiprocessing causes data preprocessing to crash</summary>
	<description>
Data preprocessing crashes when performing language model finetuning. This has to do with the size of the dataset since training ran smoothly with a dataset of 10k. This error was thrown when processing a dataset of 5 million samples.

		Fixed by setting the DataSilo's multiprocessing_chunk_size argument to a larger value (in this case, multiprocessing_chunk_size=2000)
