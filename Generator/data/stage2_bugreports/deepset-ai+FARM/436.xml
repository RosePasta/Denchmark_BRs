	<summary>Setting `num_training_steps` in `schedule_opts` is not good in function `initialize_optimizer`</summary>

 schedule_opts["num_training_steps"] = num_train_optimization_steps 





is not nice when the API user sets an explicit schedule_opts dictionary. It overwrites values. IMO it should be deleted.
What do you think?

		I wouldn't delete it, as this would be a breaking change requiring users to always compute the num_training_steps themselves (not difficult, but annoying). However, I agree that we should not overwrite in the case where a user supplies this already in schedul_opts.
So how about adding a condition there that prevents overwriting?
