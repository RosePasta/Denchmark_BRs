	<summary>Verbose warnings for empty bucket</summary>
	<description>

Seems like we introduced quite some verbose warnings with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/308&gt;#308&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/brandenchan&gt;@brandenchan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you please have a look and verify that we only print this warning if we actually removed some baskets without samples? It seems that we now always log this (once per worker).
