	<summary>Circular import in conversion/tranformers.py throwing AttributeError for python version below 3.7</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When running any of our examples I get an attribute error during module importing
Error message
File "/foo/FARM/farm/modeling/adaptive_model.py", line 19, in 
import farm.conversion.transformers as conv
File "/foo/FARM/farm/conversion/transformers.py", line 6, in 
import farm.modeling.adaptive_model as am
AttributeError: module 'farm.modeling' has no attribute 'adaptive_model'

This happens only for Python 3.6.
In Python 3.7 they changed import behavior, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.python.org/issue30024&gt;https://bugs.python.org/issue30024&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

** Proposed Soltution**
Moving the Converter back to adaptive_model.py script. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bogdankostic&gt;@bogdankostic&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tholor&gt;@tholor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 what do you think?
Alternative would be tanays quick fix in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/581&gt;#581&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but this fix might create problems on other setups.

 What kind of problems do you see with other setups?

		e.g. is the python version fix in haystack? What about python 3.5, does it work there?
In general having circular dependencies is bad design practice and we should avoid it.

		I merged &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/581&gt;#581&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 into master. Lets keep it like this for now and work on it once problems occur.
