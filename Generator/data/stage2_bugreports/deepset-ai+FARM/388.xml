	<summary>Problems with `**kwargs` in `TextClassificationProcessor`</summary>
	<description>
The TextClassificationProcessor has an **kwargs param in its constructor. See here: 


FARM/farm/data_handler/processor.py


         Line 386
      in
      258a76f






 **kwargs 





The  param is not used anywhere and should be removed. The reason is that can "eat" wrong parameter names without notice. Exactly this happens here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/blob/master/test/test_processor_saving_loading.py#L18&gt;https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/blob/master/test/test_processor_saving_loading.py#L18&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Where metrics is wrong. It should be metric without s. Also columns is an unknown param and just "eaten" by **kwargs.
What do you think? As always I could provide a PR.

		Agreed, it is nasty when this happens unexpectedly and we should avoid generic kwargs wherever possible.
I was going through the code to check if it is feasible and realized we get into trouble when generically loading a processor. I might have a working solution in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/390&gt;#390&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but will test it more thoroughly later on.
Thanks for raising this issue!
