		Seems like a version thing to me. There were a couple of fixes within the transformers repo to load models remotely. Could you test installing the latest versions?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip uninstall farm
pip uninstall transformers
cd FARM
pip install -e .
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Yes, you are right, most errors are coming from the versions. I now installed Transformers and then FARM directly from github. The current issue is resolved :) thanks.
