	<summary>model.inference_from_dicts does not return an item if no named entity is found in text</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When calling model.inference_from_dicts,  does not return an item if no named entity is found in text
To Reproduce
model = Inferencer.load(save_dir) # Connl EN NER
basic_texts = [
{"text": "I love you."},
{"text": "I love Anna."}, # only this sentence has a NE, Anna
{"text": "I love you so much!"},
]
result = model.inference_from_dicts(dicts=basic_texts)
actual output
[{'task': 'ner', 'predictions': [{'start': 7, 'end': 12, 'context': 'Anna.', 'label': 'PER', 'probability': 0.9851147}]}]
expected output
[{'task': 'ner', 'predictions': [{}, {'start': 7, 'end': 12, 'context': 'Anna.', 'label': 'PER', 'probability': 0.9851147}, {}]}]
(note the two empty dicts for the sentences where no NE was found.
Why it's important
Otherwise it's tricky to map it back to the original text...
Thanks!

		Hey, I totally agree that we need a better grouped output from the NER inferencer. I opened a pull request that now makes the Inferencer return one list per input_text that contains all the predictions for that input_text. The output looks like this:
[{'task': 'ner', 'predictions': [[], [{'start': 7, 'end': 11, 'context': 'Anna', 'label': 'PER', 'probability': 0.9971745}], []]}]
Can you give this a go and let me know if it's working for you?

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/brandenchan&gt;@brandenchan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , exactly!
(I guess you noticed, but your branch merge did not work. I was about to fix the text myself, but you beat me to it in #bc738b5 )

		The tests have been fixed and the branch is now merged. You can now try out these changes in master!
