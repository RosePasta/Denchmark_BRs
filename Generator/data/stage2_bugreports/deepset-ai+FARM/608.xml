	<summary>Error during QA dataprocessing when context is empty</summary>

Describe the bug
The problem is twofold:

If we have no text inside the document we get a Runtime error.
If we have text that does not contain the answer we do not have any warning messages.

Error message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/foo/FARM/farm/data_handler/data_silo.py", line 176, in _get_dataset
    for dataset, tensor_names in results:
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/multiprocessing/pool.py", line 735, in next
    raise value
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


I uploaded a &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Timoeller/84da8f7bd41754a768f8c49896b365b8&gt;sample file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to reproduce the error.
For problem 1. mentioned above take the file as is.
For problem 2. just insert any characters into the first context
