	<summary>Text Classification on GermEval2018 fine does not work</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When running the examples/text_classification.py on the GermEval2018 fine grained dataset (4 classes instead of two) the model does not learn anything.
Error message
No error, but macro f1 score on test set is: 0.049 instead of 0.488. Also only one class is predicted.
When dev set is evaluated during training the predictions jump from all one class to all another class.
Expected behavior
I think something happened to the class weighting. I also checked the coarse grained, there is no class weighting and the performance is normal.
Steps To Reproduce
Colab notebook with fine grained settings

		The issue resolved itself. Cannot reproduce bad performance.
My hypothesis was that it is related to class weighting of very imbalanced classes in combination with small batch size. Does not seem to be the case.
