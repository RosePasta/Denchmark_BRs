	<summary>unexpected keyword argument 'device'</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Error occurs when runnin e.g. the "test_doc_classification_distilbert.py"
Error message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: initialize_optimizer() got an unexpected keyword argument 'device'
**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Additional context
Error comes only when installing via pip. Installation via GitHub was working fine, so it seems the error was already fixed, however not commited to PyPI?
To Reproduce
Execute the "test_doc_classification_distilbert.py" file with language_model = Roberta.load(lang_model, language = "multilingual")
System:

4.15.0-1066-azure (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus))
GPU/CPU:
FARM version: 0.3.2

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/aiwalter&gt;@aiwalter&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
You are totally right. This is due to a version mismatch between the example and the latest FARM version on pypi (2.3.0).
We changed the signature of  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/133&gt;#133&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but didn't do a release since then.
We will probably do one later this week, when we are done with a few other big features (conversion to transformers, caching + checkpointing during training ...)
Until then you have two options:
a) FARM pypi version + "old" examples from tag 0.3.2 (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/tree/0.3.2&gt;https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/tree/0.3.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
b) FARM master version + current examples
Hope that helps :)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tholor&gt;@tholor&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
thx for fast feedback. I just wanted to document this error, as others might also face it :)
Please close this issue as soon as you have released the new version at PyPI.
