I suspect that there is a bug in the function  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/blob/master/farm/data_handler/input_features.py#L577&gt;https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/blob/master/farm/data_handler/input_features.py#L577&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  The conditional statement should be changed to . In its current form, this causes an answer that starts from the beginning of the sentence (i.e. ) to be labeled as (0, 0). This might be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/issues/552&gt;#552&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;processor = SquadProcessor(...)
data_silo = DataSilo(processor=processor, batch_size=16, automatic_loading=False)
basic_texts = {"context": "endesa, s.a. financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2018 5 endesa, s.a. "
                          "and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2018 207",
 "qas": [{"question": "What is the company name?", "id": "0",
          "answers": [{"text": "endesa", "answer_start": 0},
                      ], "is_impossible": False}]}

data_silo._load_data(train_dicts=[basic_texts])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print(data_silo.data['train'].datasets[0].tensors[6]) # labels
tensor([[[ 0,  0],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1]]])

print(data_silo.data['train'].datasets[0].tensors[-1]) # seq_2_start_t
tensor([8])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After changing the conditional statement to passage_len &gt; start_idx &gt;= 0:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print(data_silo.data['train'].datasets[0].tensors[6]) # labels
tensor([[[ 8, 10],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1],
         [-1, -1]]])
print(data_silo.data['train'].datasets[0].tensors[-1]) # seq_2_start_t
tensor([8])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/EhsanM4t1qbit&gt;@EhsanM4t1qbit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for pointing this out! The new PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/564&gt;#564&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 implements the fix that you suggested. Can you confirm that this fixes your issue?

		Yes it does, thanks!
Do you think it makes sense to allow passage_len to be equal to  end_idx too? (i.e. passage_len &gt;= end_idx &gt; 0)

 Sorry I missed that last message!
If end_idx = passage_len, it is pointing to a token that is outside of the passage so I think its best we keep &gt; instead of &gt;=.
But thanks for raising this issue in the first place! It has helped us greatly in debugging various issues that have come up.
