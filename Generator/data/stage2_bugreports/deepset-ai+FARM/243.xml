	<summary>Certain strings are not recognised as strings</summary>
	<description>
I had this problem before during training and encoded the strings. But now at inference time, this problem is back. The string variable is passed to the inference head.
Input is not valid. Should be a string, a list/tuple of strings or a list/tuple of integers

		Problem seems to come from transformers

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zolekode&gt;@zolekode&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Looks like your text just consists of a single "©" symbol, which might not get converted at all.
Could you try converting a string like "This is a © test"?
And yes, you are right, the error message comes from transformers in tokenization_utils.py
I suspect though this special symbol gets removed somewhere on the way, resulting in an empty string being passed to transformers.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Timoeller&gt;@Timoeller&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for the tip. I have added a little filter before to check if there are at least 3 alpha chars in the string before making predictions. Now it runs fine.

		Nice &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zolekode&gt;@zolekode&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Do you think you could add a check and better error message like this to FARM and raise a PR?
That would make the framework much better, since there is a lot of people struggling with data processing and not really informative error messages...
