	<summary>Using question_answering_crossvalidation.py on the COVID-QA data fails</summary>
	<description>
Hello developers.
I tried to run the question_answering_crossvalidation.py on the COVID-QA data (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/COVID-QA/blob/master/data/question-answering/COVID-QA.json&gt;https://github.com/deepset-ai/COVID-QA/blob/master/data/question-answering/COVID-QA.json&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and it did not work. It gave the error :
assert datasilo.tensor_names[4] == "id", f"Expected tensor 'id' at index 4, found {datasilo.tensor_names[4]}"
AssertionError: Expected tensor 'id' at index 4, found passage_start_t

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sbhttchryy&gt;@sbhttchryy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I could not reproduce the issue on current FARM master.
I also remember we changed these tensor indices some while ago to be correct, so could you update your FARM version and try again?

		Any updates on this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sbhttchryy&gt;@sbhttchryy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
Does the error persist when using the current FARM master?

		Seems inactive and hopefully solved. Closing for now, feel free to reopen if the error persists.
