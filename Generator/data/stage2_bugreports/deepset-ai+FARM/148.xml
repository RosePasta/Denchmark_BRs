	<summary>example doc_classification_multilable throws exception "TypeError: cannot perform reduce with flexible type"</summary>
	<description>
Just run the example file doc_classification_multilable.py unchanged and after a while during training (at about 10% of epoch 1) when evaluating the following exception is thrown:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TypeError: cannot perform reduce with flexible type
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/johann-petrak&gt;@johann-petrak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I was able to reproduce the issue. It seems to be a new issue with the classification_report that is called during evaluation after the first 500 steps. Might be related to the changes introduced by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/commit/432ffb136a7c260b883e55c6c134a7e49ddaf53c&gt;432ffb1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/commit/f6734cb88cb29a872cbe6dcc2ba7cbf81855cd50&gt;f6734cb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I will investigate this.
