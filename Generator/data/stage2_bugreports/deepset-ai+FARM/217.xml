Describe the bug
I try to do multi-label classification with "doc_classification_multilabel.py". It worked at first. However when it came to "Train epoch 1/1:  65%|██████▍   | 17251/26668 [10:19:41&lt;4:04:28,  1.56s/it]", it stopped and report:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/home/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 672, in urlopen
    chunked=chunked,
  File "/home/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 421, in _make_request
    six.raise_from(e, None)
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 3, in raise_from
  File "/home/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 416, in _make_request
    httplib_response = conn.getresponse()
  File "/home/python3.6/http/client.py", line 1331, in getresponse
    response.begin()
  File "/home/python3.6/http/client.py", line 297, in begin
    version, status, reason = self._read_status()
  File "/home/python3.6/http/client.py", line 266, in _read_status
    raise RemoteDisconnected("Remote end closed connection without"
http.client.RemoteDisconnected: Remote end closed connection without response
......
urllib3.exceptions.ProtocolError: ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response',))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I have checked that the Internet connection was ok. So I was confused why this error occured ?

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JiangYanting&gt;@JiangYanting&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Are you using our public mlflow server for logging (i.e. ml_logger = MLFlowLogger(tracking_uri="https://public-mlflow.deepset.ai/")  in doc_classification_multilabel.py)?
I would assume that your connection to that server was not available when the model tried to log the train_loss at step 17251.
I see two solutions:

short term: you can log locally by setting ml_logger = MLFlowLogger(tracking_uri="")
mid term: implementing a fix in FARM, so that we raise only a warning, if the logging doesn't succeed, but let the training continue. Let me know if you are interested in adding a PR for this. Otherwise, we can take care. It would be basically a try / catch block here: https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/blob/master/farm/utils.py#L126
