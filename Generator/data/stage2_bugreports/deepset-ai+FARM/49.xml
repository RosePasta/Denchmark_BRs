	<summary>`dev_size` param in run-by-config is being ignored</summary>
	<description>
I tried setting the dev_sizeparameter in the following ways (in different runs).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"dev_size": {"value": [0.2,0.3], "default": 0.1, "desc": "Split a dev set from the training set using dev_size as proportion."}
"dev_size": {"value": 0.2, "default": 0.1, "desc": "Split a dev set from the training set using dev_size as proportion."}
"dev_size": {"value": null, "default": 0.2, "desc": "Split a dev set from the training set using dev_size as proportion."}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It always defaulted to dev_size=0.1. This value is being set in the constructor of my processor, just as in the GermEval examples.
Is this supposed behaviour?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tripl3a&gt;@tripl3a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It isn't the supposed behaviour, but an error. It's now fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/53&gt;#53&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
