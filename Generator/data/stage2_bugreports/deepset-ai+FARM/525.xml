	<summary>Warning message spam "please use `truncation=True` to explicitely truncate examples to max length"</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
since I use the code from master branch I am getting spammed with these messages:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Truncation was not explicitely activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitely truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/482&gt;#482&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .

		Hey,
For which task do you get this? Are you using fast or slow tokenizers?

		Text classification. Since I did not specify to use fast I think I use slow.
