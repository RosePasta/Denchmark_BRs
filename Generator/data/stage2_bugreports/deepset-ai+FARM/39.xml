<bug id='39' author='tripl3a' open_date='2019-08-04T09:17:48Z' closed_time='2019-08-06T10:24:26Z'>
	<summary>output_dir parameter in run by config is being ignored</summary>
	<description>
If you set the parameter like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    "output_dir": {"value": "/path/to/output", "default": "", "desc": "Output directory where model predictions and checkpoints will be saved."},
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

You will get an error if the directory already exists and the run will stop.
If the director does not exist the run will be successfully executed but the directory will be empty afterwards and the log will contain such entries:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;08/03/2019 15:11:20 - WARNING - farm.file_utils -   Path saved_models/bert-german-GermEval18Coarse already exists. You might be overwriting files.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Also dev_sizeis being ignored. Trying the three following configurations always defaulted to dev_size=0.1.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    "dev_size":         {"value": [0.2,0.3], "default": 0.1, "desc": "Split a dev set from the training set using dev_size as proportion."}
    "dev_size":         {"value": 0.2, "default": 0.1, "desc": "Split a dev set from the training set using dev_size as proportion."}
    "dev_size":         {"value": null, "default": 0.2, "desc": "Split a dev set from the training set using dev_size as proportion."}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
