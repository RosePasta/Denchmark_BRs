		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guggio&gt;@guggio&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, are you running on Google Colab or your local machine?
If you're running locally, can you try uninstalling farm with pip uninstall farm and re-installing from the latest master branch with pip install -e . from the FARM root directory?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tanaysoni&gt;@tanaysoni&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I was running on google colab. I just retried it with two different approaches to install Farm on Colab:
First:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;!git clone https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM.git
!pip install -r FARM/requirements.txt
!pip install FARM/
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This used to work, but now fails with the mentioned exception.
Second:
!pip install farm==0.4.3
It is the first time I used this way to install it and it works fine. Do you have an explanation, why this approach works and the other fails?

 adding  seems to correct the problem thanks

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guggio&gt;@guggio&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, in the first case, FARM is installed from the latest master branch. It was breaking due to missing  files, which is now fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/pull/365&gt;#365&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If you want to try out cutting-edge(yet to be released) features, then use approach 1. For working with a stable release, use approach 2.
