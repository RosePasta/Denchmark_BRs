	<summary>farm.modeling.language_model.load does not make use of 'language' **kargs if present</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
As suggested from the WARNING below if the  'language' **kargs is present in farm.modeling.language_model.load method that should be used to setup the language. This is not realized now.
The referred method is:



FARM/farm/modeling/language_model.py


         Line 70
      in
      d200a73






 def load(cls, pretrained_model_name_or_path, n_added_tokens=0, **kwargs): 





Error message
I obtained the following after executing the code  listed in the To Reproduce section below:

	 We guess it's an *ENGLISH* model ...

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
Set language as the kargs passed.
Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here, like type of downstream task, part of  etc..

from farm.modeling.language_model import LanguageModel

language_model = LanguageModel.load('dbmdz/bert-base-italian-cased', language='italian')
System:

		You are totally right, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ftesser&gt;@ftesser&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The warning message had a good intention, but totally missed the implementation behind it. Thanks for spotting &amp; fixing!
