	<summary>Experiments cannot run with eval_every == 0</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
For my experiment, I don't use a dev set and thus don't need the dev evaluation after a certain amount of training steps. Therefore, I set the eval_every variable to 0 in my experiment-json (as suggested in the description in the json) . Unfortunately, this leads to a ZeroDivisionError as listed below. It seems to me, an additional conditional statement (self.evaluate_every != 0) in line 249 of train.py would resolve this issue. I was able to perform my experiment by setting it to a number, larger than the total training steps, but this is just fighting the symptoms.
Thanks guys and keep up the great work!

ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected behavior
No Error :)
To Reproduce
Run an experiment with the eval_every variable set to 0 (value or default, doesn't matter).
