	<summary>Wrong number of total steps for linear warmup schedule</summary>
	<description>
The number of total steps is currently wrongly calculated due to wrong rounding here: 


FARM/farm/experiment.py


         Line 256
      in
      90ecbeb






 optimization_steps = int(n_examples / batch_size / grad_acc_steps) * n_epochs 





It's resulting in one step less than required per epoch. If running for multiple epochs, this will result in LR = 0 for the last few steps. The related warning message occurs:
Training beyond specified 't_total'. Learning rate multiplier set to 0. Please set 't_total' of {} correctly.
In addition, we start with a LR of zero for the first step which is a waste of computation.
