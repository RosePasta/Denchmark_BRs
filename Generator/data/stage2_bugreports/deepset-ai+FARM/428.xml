	<summary>Loading of saved model results in Unexpected key(s) in state_dict: "loss_fct.weight"</summary>

Describe the bug
We cannot load a Prediction Head with class weights.
Error message
RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for TextClassificationHead:
Unexpected key(s) in state_dict: "loss_fct.weight".
I suspect this bug was introduced by updating to pytorch version 1.5.0.
Unfortunately we do not have tests covering this use case, so we cannot pin the cause exactly.
