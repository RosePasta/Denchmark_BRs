	<summary>Trainer fixes all seeds to 39</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
In Trainer.train() seeds are hardcoded to 39 by calling set_all_seeds(seed=39) (two times).
Thus any calls to set_all_seeds in training scripts are ignored.
Error message
None
Expected behavior
Calling set_all_seeds from arbitrary training scripts works as intended and is not ignored.
To Reproduce
start arbitrary training
System:

OS: all
GPU/CPU: all
FARM version: since 5151b36
