	<summary>Calling torchtext.data.Dataset slow after updating to 0.2.0</summary>
	<description>
After updating to tag 0.2.0 calling torchtext.data.Dataset is a lot slower (doesn't seem to stop for CNNDM dataset) when using dynamic_dict as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/45d92297e40775d46c66df60c69060e63bfa4417/onmt/IO.py#L364-L378&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (passing filter as well).
After downgrading back to 0.1.1 works well again.
Couldn't find any reason why this might happen.
Any advice?

		I will close this issue since we are now on 0.4.0. Feel free to reopen it if you still experience the slowdown.
