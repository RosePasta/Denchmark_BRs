	<summary>Length of iterator fails in Python 2</summary>
	<description>
The division len(dataset) / batch_size will be cast to int in python2, so that math.ceil doesn't really work when len(dataset) is not a multiple of batch size.

		Yeah, this is a bug. The solution should be to wrap batch_size in float. Will fix.

		I think it's preferable to just from __future__ import division?
