	<summary>HyperGAN Crash 'CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED'</summary>
	<description>
I had HyperGAN fail when I tried to move the window to another screen. It looks like it's an error somewhere in TensorFlow, but maybe that's an issue with how we call TF? I decided to write it here in the case taht it might help.
Here's the related cmd output:
2020-02-15 09:22:22.020538: E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_event.cc:29] Error polling for event status: failed to query event: CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_FAILED: unspecified launch failure 2020-02-15 09:22:22.026183: F tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_event_mgr.cc:273] Unexpected Event status: 1
(everything above this message is your normal loss info, nothing out of the ordinary)

		I've just encountered the same issue, this time not within a window move.

		This should be fixed in 1.0 when released(uses pytorch).
