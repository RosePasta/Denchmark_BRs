	<summary>Hypergan Is Not a Package</summary>
	<description>
I run this command:
hypergan test
And get this back:
  File "C:\Users\dusti\AppData\Local\Programs\Python37\Scripts\\hypergan", line 7, in &lt;module&gt; import hypergan as hg File "C:\Users\dusti\AppData\Local\Programs\Python37\Scripts\hypergan.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt; import hypergan.cli as cli ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hypergan.cli'; 'hypergan' is not a package
I have literally installed all requirements, they are working perfect. This is so damn frustrating.

		Sorry for the frustration. The dependencies on hypergan made it tough to install, one of the main drivers for switching to pytorch. This should be fixed in 1.0 when it's released.
