	<summary>[Issue] partition number in ImageSet.read and NNImageReader is not always working</summary>

		The issue is duplicate with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/analytics-zoo/zoo/issues/271&gt;analytics-zoo/zoo#271&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think it's more like an spark optimization and it looks good to me.
