Some issues in anomaly detection notebook problem:


In Readme, it says : export ZOO_HOME=the root directory of the Analytics Zoo project. But in jupyter-with-zoo.sh, it needs ZOO_HOME to be the dist directory or build directory. We need to clarify this environment. I suggest to set another variable, like ZOO_SOURCE to the root directory of the Analytics Zoo project. And keep ZOO_HOME pointing to the build. In the notebook code, it also use ZOO_HOME as the root directory of the Analytics Zoo project.


In jupyter-with-zoo.sh, it would find zoo jar and python zip with "zooxxx", need to change to "analytics-zooxxx". Also, --allow-root option is not working in my jupyter.


Running notebook, I met an issue in cell 8 with command "df['hours'] = df['datetime'].dt.hour":


&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
