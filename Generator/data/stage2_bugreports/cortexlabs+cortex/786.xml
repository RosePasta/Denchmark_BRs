&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Pod readiness check has two components, watching for a health check file and ensuring that the python process is still running. The check ensuring that the python process is still running is incorrect because it checks for api.py instead of serve.py. The process check may be returning true regardless of whether the process is running or not.
