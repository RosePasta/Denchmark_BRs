	<summary>Discrepancy between the response code received by client and the response code recorded by websever</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The response codes (200, 404 etc.) are recorded in the webserver currently. If the there is an error in the network (e.g. a timeout), the webserver may still record a 200 while the client may receive a 5XX response code. The output of cortex get may be misleading.
Should response codes be collected in multiple areas along the network? If yes, which metrics should be displayed in cortex get?
