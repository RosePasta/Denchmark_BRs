	<summary>Image download shown as successful but see error: "No such image: cortexlabs/python-predictor-cpu:0.18.1"</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

0.18.1
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

On Mac OS (High Sierra) docker pull silently fails when downloading the python-predictor-cpu image:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;￮ downloading docker image cortexlabs/python-predictor-cpu:0.18.1 .................................................................... ✓
/Users/rocco.cammisola/Documents/[PROJECT DIR]/cortex.yaml: [API ENDPOINT NAME]: Error response from daemon: No such image: cortexlabs/python-predictor-cpu:0.18.1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The output suggests that the download was successful but when I performed docker pull cortexlabs/python-predictor-cpu:0.18.1 I found out that my docker VM had run out of space.
Performing docker system prune (or similar) to clear the VM resolved the issue.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Set docker VM size on Mac to be smaller than the cortexlabs python predictor image
cortex deploy

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The download is not marked as successful (tick not shown) and the error about being out of space is reported.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Download marked as successful, no error directly related to not being able to pull the image.

		Thanks for filing the issue with the reproduction steps and so much detail. We will look into it and try to surface a meaningful error when image download fails.
