	<summary>While cluster is deleting, cortex cluster install reports that cluster is running</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

cortex cluster delete followed with cortex cluster up shortly after results in this error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;error: Cortex does not currently support changing the instance type of a running cluster; please run `cortex cluster down` followed by `cortex cluster up` to create a new cluster
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The error message should be something like:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;error: Your cluster is currently deleting, please wait a few minutes and try again
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
