&lt;= 0.21.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A job gets stuck in the running status. It is possible that this happens when a worker is terminated abruptly in scenarios such as the spot instance being taken away.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce (not yet confirmed)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Submit a Job with a long running task
Terminate the node in AWS console (to simulate abrupt worker termination)

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Once the worker is ready, the worker should take items from the queue
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After the new worker has spun up, it looks for items in the queue, finds that it is empty and then terminates.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Suggested solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If the error is related to the worker not being able to find a message after being killed abruptly, a potential solution can be to update the way the worker receives the message. Currently each message from the SQS is owned for 12 hours (the maximum visibility). When a message is received, set the message visibility for a short period of time (1 minute) and renew the message visibility in a background thread. When the message has been processed or an error has occurred delete the message and stop the renewing message visibility thread.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Additional context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The situation might be ameliorated by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/issues/927&gt;#927&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
