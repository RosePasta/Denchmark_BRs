	<summary>Bad request is returning 500 status code instead of 400</summary>
	<description>

When post a bad request that should be a json, how can I define the response for the clientï¼Ÿ It seems just reply "500 Internal Server Error" now.  When the client post a request that is not  json format, how can I tell the client with the response?
If I do not set the -H "Content-Type: application/json", but the request data is  standard json format, the payload in the server is empty.  I just print the payload in the predict :

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        print("payload type=", type(payload))
        print("payload=", payload)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

the print result are below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;payload type= starlette.datastructures.FormData
payload= FormData([]) # it is empty, why?
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

why the body get by the server is empty?
Thanks a lot!

 thank you a lot for reporting this. Indeed, this doesn't appear to be the right behavior for the webserver:

When a post request with a malformed JSON is made, a 400 error code should be returned. Instead, it gets a 500.
When the content-type is not set (i.e."Content-Type: "), your payload parameter should be a bytes object.

Also, when the user doesn't set the content-type for a curl request, curl will automatically set it to . This can explain why you are getting a  object. I presume you were using the  utility for this. Check this out:
