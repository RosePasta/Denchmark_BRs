	<summary>Verify accuracy of request metrics for a local deployment using multiple threads</summary>

v0.18.*
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Support for multithreading and multiprocessing was recently added to Cortex local. Request metrics are tracked by increment files to a local directory. Multiprocessing with Cortex local may work as expected because each process writes to files prefixed with their PIDs. However, multithreading on Cortex local may be broken.
Add a mutex to request metrics files to prevent multiple threads from overwriting the same file with outdated values.
