	<summary>Deployment of local API with public models is not possible without AWS creds</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Since 0.22.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When a local API is deployed that's using the live-reloading/multi-model caching feature and the specified model(s) is/are public, the API will stop abruptly if no AWS credentials have been configured for it (either via the local environment or by including the credentials in the .env file).
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Suggested solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If a model is public and there are no AWS credentials set, then the S3 client should be anonymous.
