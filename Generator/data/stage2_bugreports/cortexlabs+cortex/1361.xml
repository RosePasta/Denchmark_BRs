	<summary>refreshCachedClusterConfig() can return a cluster config with nil region</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Likely the root cause of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/issues/1325&gt;#1325&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

One theory is that an issue with the volume mount could cause this, i.e. refresh_cluster_config.py executes successfully, but since the cluster config file it writes to is not mounted properly, it doesn't propagate back to the CLI.
