	<summary>Can't remove a job with one worker using BatchAPI and DELETE request</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

cli version: 0.20.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've started a job with 1 worker and I can successfully get its status:
$ cortex get imagesearch-batch 69bfbc4539100651 --env aws
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;job id: 69bfbc4539100651
status: running

start time: 22 Oct 2020 08:38:57 UTC
end time:   -
duration:   52m47s

batch stats
total   succeeded   failed   avg time per batch
100     5           0        10m8.08s

job endpoint: https://hv5geqzdo9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/imagesearch-batch/69bfbc4539100651

job configuration
{
  "job_id": "69bfbc4539100651",
  "api_name": "imagesearch-batch",
  "workers": 1,
  "config": {
    "dest_s3_dir": "s3://..."
  },
  "api_id": "69bfbc5ab59b0d80--b2c011c906d3de3174508d257cd93b84",
  "spec_id": "b2c011c906d3de3174508d257cd93b84",
  "predictor_id": "6bdcd409fa472756e2a38468565cbc57325c6a323ca935da22dbd541bae05b1",
  "sqs_url": "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.../1ee11af4ed-imagesearch-batch-69bfbc4539100651.fifo",
  "total_batch_count": 100,
  "start_time": "2020-10-22T08:38:57.025302536Z"
} 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Though when I tried to request :
curl -X DELETE https://hv5geqzdo9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/imagesearch-batch/69bfbc4539100651
The result is:
{"message":"Not Found"}
Which is a bit strange as was able to delete jobs with several workers before.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Configuration&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;- name: imagesearch-batch
  kind: BatchAPI
  predictor:
    type: python
    path: predictor.py
  compute:
    cpu: 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Create a cluster with t3.small instances and default parameters min:1-max:5
Submit a job with several batches but 1 worker so it's going to last for a while
Try to delete this job using curl -X DELETE and API URL + jobib

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The corresponding job should be successfully stopped.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Job continues to run after the DELETE request.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Stack traces&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No issues with the job running:

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Suggested solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Might be connected with using only 1 worker as I was able to successfully delete jobs with 5 workers before.

		Thanks for bringing this to our attention. After investigating this issue, we believe that this bug could be caused by some non-deterministic behaviour during the API Gateway route setup. We are continuing to investigate this issue. In the meantime, you could try to deploy your BatchAPI by explicitly disabling API Gateway:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;- name: api:
  kind: BatchAPI
  networking:
    api_gateway: none # the default is public
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
