&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Configuration&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

    config:
      bucket: offer-features-model

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

form the iris-classifier example &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/blob/master/examples/sklearn/iris-classifier/README.md&gt;https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/blob/master/examples/sklearn/iris-classifier/README.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think you need to update the docs

 The  key is a new key in the config that is on the master branch but has not been released yet. The examples you've mentioned contain this key because those examples are on the master branch and apply to Cortex version master. Since you are using Cortex 0.18, the sklearn iris-classifier document can be found here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/blob/0.18/examples/sklearn/iris-classifier/README.md&gt;https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/blob/0.18/examples/sklearn/iris-classifier/README.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
At the top of the examples and docs on the master branch, we've added a warning WARNING: you are on the master branch, please refer to the examples on the branch that matches your cortex version to help subvert this.
However, it looks like more work needs to be done to make it harder for users to accidentally view unreleased versions of docs and examples.
Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
