cortex.yaml: reading-comprehender (RealtimeAPI): failed to allocate GPU: Error response from daemon: could not select device driver "" with capabilities: [[gpu]]

only NVIDIA gpus are supported
please make sure that you've set up nvidia-container-runtime or nvidia-container-toolkit for your Docker Engine correctly (https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu)

I am getting the above error. I set "gpu" to 0 and am now getting the following error:

 regarding the  error, I tried to replicate it too, but without success - the example worked fine for me.
What I think it's happening is that the docker service may have gotten stuck in a broken state - I'd recommend stopping the docker service, clearing the /var/lib/docker directory, and then restarting the service.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As for the original issue, the questions are:

Does your machine have access to at least 1x Nvidia GPU (with all of its drivers installed, aka please make sure that you've set up nvidia-container-runtime or nvidia-container-toolkit for your Docker Engine correctly (https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#gpu))?
What OS is this running on? MacOS/Linux/Linux Subsystem on Windows?

 The /var/lib/docker directory does not exist on my Mac.  I've restarted my Docker and tried again with no luck.
I'm currently on MacOS Catalina v10.15.7
MacBook Pro 2.3GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5
Memory: 16GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3
Graphics: Intel Iris Plus Graphics 655 1536 MB
The above is the graphic card I have installed. I don't have an NVidia card, therefore I set gpu to 0.
Thank you.

 yeah, it seems like on Mac, that directory is within the user's home directory - like I read here on SO &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19234831/where-are-docker-images-stored-on-the-host-machine/37642236#37642236&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19234831/where-are-docker-images-stored-on-the-host-machine/37642236#37642236&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I think that the best way to reset Docker is to go through this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#reset&gt;https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#reset&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Let us know if that worked for you!

 Another thing you can try is to uninstall docker on your Mac, and re-install it. That seems to have helped some people on this thread: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5763&gt;docker/for-win#5763&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
