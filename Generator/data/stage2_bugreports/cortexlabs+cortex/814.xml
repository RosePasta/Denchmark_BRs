	<summary>Intermittent failed requests during rolling updates</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As old pods spin down during a rolling update, some requests return 503. Istio is hiding the more detailed error message - when bypassing Istio with service of type: loadbalancer, the error is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Post http://a2b34b2aa4ec411eaab8a0a465d27bdf-e1fddee29350e253.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/predict: read tcp 172.31.1.222:42654-&gt;54.71.144.207:80: read: connection reset by peer
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Reproduction&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create an iris deployment with min and max of e.g. 2 replicas. Run dev/load.go with at least 100 concurrent threads and no delays. Perform a rolling update, and watch for 503 errors (or the connection reset by peer error if using the load balancer service) as the old pods are terminating.

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Possibly related issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Also, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vishalbollu&gt;@vishalbollu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 reported that during large scale ups that require many new nodes (e.g. 1 -&gt; 200 nodes), some 503 errors are also seen. This may or may not be the same root cause. A separate ticket should be created to track this if a fix for this issue doesn't resolve it.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Possibly related issue 2&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It seems that deleting an API, deploying it again, waiting for the previous pod to terminate, and then creating a high volume of parallel requests also results in 503 errors. See the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/networking-debugging&gt;networking-debugging&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 branch.
