0.23.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

After starting the cluster with cortex cluster up. I'm trying to get the operator end-point, but I got a error related to api gateway:
$ cortex cluster info
`

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Configuration&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

default config
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


cortex cluster up
cortex cluster info

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

To get information about cluster, specially operator end-point
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Got a error related to api gateway, and broken the prompt

		Additionally, seems that the cortex dont created the api gateway, so, I've created an API and included the tag cortex.dev/cluster-name=cortex into api gateway. but error persists.

 Thanks for creating the issue.
If you used a cluster configuration file (e.g. cluster.yaml) when creating your cluster, do you mind sharing its contents? If you didn't use a cluster config file, do you mind sharing how you answered the CLI prompts?
Also, did you see any errors when creating your cluster? If you still have the output from your cortex cluster up command, do you mind sharing that too?
Lastly, if you try to spin up a new cluster (with a different name), does it work as expected?
