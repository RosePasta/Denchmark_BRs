	<summary>Query min/max instances from AWS ASG rather than locally-saved cluster configuration</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If an error occurs after resizing the node group during cortex cluster update (e.g. Cortex bucket does not exist), the cluster update will not complete, but the node group will be resized. This change is not reflected in cortex cluster info.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Solutions&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Option 1: Undo the cluster resizing
Option 2: Propagate the config change into the cluster's config file
Option 3: Query the node group size from the AWS ASG api on cortex cluster update (rather than from the cached cluster configuration file)
