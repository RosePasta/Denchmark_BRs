	<summary>API deployment failure when API is quickly deleted and then re-deployed</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&gt;= 0.20.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When an API is quickly re-deployed (deleted and then deployed, not just run with cortex deploy), the route created for the API gateway doesn't work. When making any request to the API's endpoint, the {"message":"Not Found"} response is returned.
This is most likely an AWS bug that we need to circumvent.
First noticed on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/issues/1473&gt;#1473&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

For ease of use, the python client is used to deploy-&gt;delete-&gt;cycle the API. In the following example, a RealTime API is tested.
import cortex as c
import requests
import time
def main():
    print("testing")
    client = c.client("aws")
    for i in range(100):
        deployments = client.deploy(
            "/home/ubuntu/src/github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/examples/pytorch/iris-classifier/cortex.yaml",
            wait=False,
        )
        time.sleep(10)
        url = deployments[0]["api"]["endpoint"]
        response = requests.get(url).text
        print(i, response)
        client.delete_api("iris-classifier")
        time.sleep(1)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This is also applicable to the API splitters.
To be verified if this is also happening on the Batch API.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Suggested solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

So far, we have 2 possible solutions:


Add a 1-second delay here or here.


1 + inside the function that creates the gateway, make requests for up to 5 times and if every time {"message":"Not Found"} is returned, then consider the API deployment to be a failure, otherwise, proceed on the first successful request.
