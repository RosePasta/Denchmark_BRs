	<summary>Error in error status message</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There was a situation in which an api pod failed, restarted, and then succeeded. Afterwards, cortex get still show the api as failed (it showed the "error" status), although it did say the replica was "updated" in the table of counts (but there was 1 failed as well)
Expected behavior: the 1 failed should have been 0 failed, which should automatically fix the api status
