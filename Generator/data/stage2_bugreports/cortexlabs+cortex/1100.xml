	<summary>Deployemnts with conda-packages fail in 0.17.0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

0.17.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Deployments with conda-packages.txt, which worked fine in 0.16.0, hang on installing conda packages.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Create a python-predictor-gpu deployment with conda-packages.txt
Deploy to local environment

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Deployment goes up.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hangs at this screen (shown through cortex logs):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:

  bzip2              pkgs/main/linux-64::bzip2-1.0.8-h7b6447c_0
  ffmpeg             conda-forge/linux-64::ffmpeg-4.2.3-h167e202_0
  freetype           pkgs/main/linux-64::freetype-2.9.1-h8a8886c_1
  gmp                conda-forge/linux-64::gmp-6.2.0-he1b5a44_2
  gnutls             pkgs/main/linux-64::gnutls-3.6.5-h71b1129_1002
  lame               pkgs/main/linux-64::lame-3.100-h7b6447c_0
  libiconv           pkgs/main/linux-64::libiconv-1.15-h63c8f33_5
  libpng             pkgs/main/linux-64::libpng-1.6.37-hbc83047_0
  nettle             pkgs/main/linux-64::nettle-3.4.1-hbb512f6_0
  openh264           conda-forge/linux-64::openh264-2.1.1-h8b12597_0
  x264               conda-forge/linux-64::x264-1!152.20180806-h14c3975_0

The following packages will be SUPERSEDED by a higher-priority channel:

  ca-certificates    conda-forge::ca-certificates-2020.4.5~ --&gt; pkgs/main::ca-certificates-2020.1.1-0
  certifi            conda-forge::certifi-2020.4.5.1-py36h~ --&gt; pkgs/main::certifi-2020.4.5.1-py36_0
  openssl            conda-forge::openssl-1.1.1g-h516909a_0 --&gt; pkgs/main::openssl-1.1.1g-h7b6447c_0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Suggested solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Add -y option to conda install. See PR committed.

 I'm able to reproduce this. Would you say this bug is a blocker for you? We can create a patch release specifically for this issue in case you need it ASAP.

		That's okay, if the docker images are rebuilt, I can work off master for testing. Given the previous release cycle, a new release should come out in the next 1--2 weeks?

 thanks for bringing this to our attention, and for contributing the fix!
I just spoke with the team, and we think it does make sense to make a patch release for this. There is one other small fix that we're working on which we may finish soon, so we'll hold off for a day to see if we can get that in too, and then we'll release 0.17.1.

		Also, in case it's relevant to you, this issue only seems to happen locally (it doesn't get stuck on AWS)

		I can confirm that it's fixed on the master branch for me. Looking forward to 0.17.1
