	<summary>Fix scalar and no-rank/no-shape tensor validation when using the TensorFlow predictor</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

2 properties of a tensor (in TensorFlow) are the rank and shape. Right now, when using the TensorFlow predictor, only the 2 following kinds of tensors are supported:

Tensors with known rank and shape. Such as (3, 224, 224).
Tensors with known rank and unknown shape. Such as (3, -1, -1).

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When tensors have the following properties, the validation will fail, when in reality, it shouldn't:

Tensors with no rank and empty shape - for scalars. Such as ().
Tensors with unknown rank and shape. Such as (-1, -1, -1, ...).

When an input tensor has the above properties, the following error pops up the logs cortex logs &lt;api-name&gt;.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
