&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/dtypes.py:516: FutureWarning: Passing (type, 1) or '1type' as a synonym of type is deprecated; in a future version of numpy, it will be understood as (type, (1,)) / '(1,)type'.
  _np_qint8 = np.dtype([("qint8", np.int8, 1)])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(this was reached by hitting this error: TensorFlow model directories must have the following structure:)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Potential Options:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
