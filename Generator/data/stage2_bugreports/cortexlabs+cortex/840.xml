	<summary>Cortex cluster update fails when the new min_instance value is higher than the previous max_instance value</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Cortex cluster update fails when attempting to set a new min_instances count which is greater than the previous max_instances setting.
In install.sh min_instances is set first in the autoscaling groups, therefore the update to min_instances will fail because it is higher than the previously configured max_instances.
Update install.sh to update autoscaling group in the correct order. If the new min_instances is greater than previous max instances, update max_instances first. Conversely, update min_instances first if the previous max_instances is smaller then the new min_instances.
