	<summary>OOM status not reported for Task/Batch APIs at all times</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are multiple cases when the OOM error is not reported in cortex get:

Exit code 137/236/237/350/363/370 as shown in logs, but exit code 0 in container status with reason as OOMKilled and Job marked as Successful.
Exit code 137/236/237/350 as shown in logs, but exit code 0 in container status with reason as OOMKilled and Job marked as Failed.
Pod evicted by k8s engine, with Job marked as Successful, but with pod reason “memory was too low, had to be evicted”-like message.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproducibility&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Set a very low mem request in the cortex.yaml config and then create a big numpy array in the job.
Submit the job and notice the job status not being set to OOM.
