	<summary>User segfault with multiple workers causes pod to get stuck as not ready, without being restarted</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When there is 1 worker, a segfault causes the pod to restart, which is the intended behavior. Also, the segfault shows up in the logs.
However, with 2 workers, a segfault does not cause the pod to restart. Instead, the pod is just stuck being "not ready". Also, the segfault does not show up in the logs.
A liveness probe which checked that the uvicorn processes were running was the first attempt at solving this, however this caused APIs which take a long time to pip install to fail the liveness probe before every being ready.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;To reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Set workers_per_replica to 2, and add this to a predict() function:
import ctypes
ctypes.string_at(0)
