	<summary>CLI Unexpected response from operator (status code 405)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Version&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Noticed this on 0.18.1 and 0.19.0.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When cortex deploying, there are situations when error: Unexpected response from operator (status code 405) is returned instead of actually deploying the API.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are no exact steps to reproduce yet. Just that it seems to occur when  is run. As reported by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/balakrishna222111&gt;@balakrishna222111&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 thank you for the info.
Since we haven't been able to reproduce this yet, the next time that you see this error, do you mind sending us an email to &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:dev@cortex.dev&gt;dev@cortex.dev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which includes the following information?

The zip file generated by cortex cluster info --debug
Your cluster.yaml` config (please hide or omit any AWS credentials)
Your cortex.yaml config

 thank you. Were you observing the 405s at the time you created the cluster info zip file? Also, does the request fail 100% of the time or is it intermittent?

 Also, do you have a  file, or did you create your cluster without it (answering the cli prompts instead)?

 I wanted to follow up on this: we didn't see any obvious issues in the information that you sent, and we have tried and been unable to reproduce it.
Are you still seeing error: Unexpected response from operator (status code 405)? If it's still a problem for you, do you mind trying on the latest release (0.21)?

 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Mahi-debug&gt;@Mahi-debug&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I'll go ahead and close this issue since we have improved the networking stack in recent releases. Feel free to reach out if you encounter this problem again!
