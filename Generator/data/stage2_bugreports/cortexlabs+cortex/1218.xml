	<summary>Investigate validity of error message when re-deploying on a different CLI version</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Trying to re-deploy an API locally with a newer version of the CLI will return the following type of message:
api model was deployed using CLI version 0.17.1 but the current CLI version is 0.18.1; please run `cortex deploy` to redeploy the api or `cortex delete model` to delete the api`ï¿½
As reported by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/elliotzeitgold&gt;@elliotzeitgold&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running any of the two suggested commands should work - and not return an error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running any of the two suggested commands in the error message will fail with the same error message.

		Part of the error message is indeed contradictory/recursive: please run cortex deploy to redeploy the api or cortex delete model to delete the api. Running cortex deploy or cortex delete would return the same error.
