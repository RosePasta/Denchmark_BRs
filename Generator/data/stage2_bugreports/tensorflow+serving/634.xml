	<summary>go code by protoc have `import cycle not allowed` err</summary>
	<description>
I use go to call grpc serving's grpc service(already succeed with java)
In  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/apis/predict.proto#L7&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/apis/predict.proto#L7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

import "tensorflow_serving/apis/model.proto";
will make tensorflow_serving/apis/predict.pb.go by protoc
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow_serving1 "tensorflow_serving/apis"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

this line of code make the err import cycle not allowed, this there any way work around?

		I'm also running into this (or a very similar) issue, there's import cycles in pb generated files. Any thoughts?

import core "tensorflow_serving/core"

		I tried to build a serving go client from here &lt;denchmark-link:https://mauri870.github.io/blog/posts/tensorflow-serving-inception-go&gt;https://mauri870.github.io/blog/posts/tensorflow-serving-inception-go&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

but the following error showed up. Adding the tensorflow_serving/core in the packages results in import cycle. Anyone knows how to fix this?
vendor/tensorflow_serving/apis/prediction_log.pb.go:9:8: cannot find package "tensorflow_serving/core" in any of:
/home/../vendor/tensorflow_serving/core (vendor tree)
/usr/local/go/src/tensorflow_serving/core (from $GOROOT)
