When i use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/example/resnet_client.py&gt;resnet_client.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to invoke the REST API provided by the&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/resnet&gt;model&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 i downloaded. it returns http status 400 and "Type: Object is not of expected type: float" }"  error.
