&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Bug Report&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 16.04
TensorFlow Serving installed from (source or binary): apt
TensorFlow Serving version: 1.14.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm trying to install tensorflow-model-server 1.14.0 through APT but it seems that the GPG key used to sign the package is expired.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;W: GPG error: http://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-serving-apt testing InRelease: The following signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED 1562881134  KEYEXPIRED 1562881134  KEYEXPIRED 1562881134
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Exact Steps to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

See documentation: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/g3doc/setup.md#installing-using-apt&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/g3doc/setup.md#installing-using-apt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I don't know if this applies to your situations, but I was using AWS SageMaker and adding --allow-unauthenticated after RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install tensorflow-model-server solved the problem for me. But you will expose yourself to security risks, so be warned.

		I'm able to use apt-get to install TFS in an isolated docker environment before closing this issue.
Re Balaji, if you are still facing the issue, could you provide full commands and error messages?

  I was able to resolve this after following the instructions for installing tensorflow-model-server.
The confusion was how we got this error, here the thing we have installed tensorflow earlier, but in the recent release, there is an update key for model-serving.
Anyways thanks.
