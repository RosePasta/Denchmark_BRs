	<summary>Pipeline fails with tf.keras.Model subclass</summary>
	<description>
Running a pipeline throws a  when using a custom tf.Estimator whose  references a  subclass. This bug was first tracked by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/issues/500&gt;#500&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 before I figured out what the root cause was. Replacing the subclass with a direct call to tf.keras.Sequential with the same layers works just fine, however, this is only a stopgap solution since more complicated models might require subclassing or the keras functional API (which I will test).

 IIUC you have a custom  subclass and want to use that in your trainer module? If so, where is the definition of the subclass?

		I define my custom class in my pipeline utils file, where preprocessing_fn, trainer_fn etc lives too. The class is instantiated in model_fn, which in turn is called in trainer_fn

 can you share the code (or skeleton of the code)? It'll be easier to debug.

 The skeleton is in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/issues/500&gt;#500&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I asked for it as well :-)

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/neuromage&gt;@neuromage&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !

    estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(
        model_fn, params=hparams, config=config)


&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JakeTheWise&gt;@JakeTheWise&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you try to use  to convert a keras model to estimator?

		Yep I'll try that, thanks.
