	<summary>Over rapped TFX libraries character layout into TensorFlow Serving and Model Server on Docs</summary>
	<description>
I found one part of the broken image in TFX docs.
But I can't edit this SVG, so I reported as issues.

		Thank you for reporting!
Did you see this image in the guide document in &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
Because it renders well in my environment, can you share your browser environment when the image is broken?

		Thank you for the detail!
I'm using exactly same broswer / version, but it looks good.
But I found that the image looks ugly(as you have shown above) in MacOS Safari 13.0.5.
I think that this can be fixed by using png or other formats.
