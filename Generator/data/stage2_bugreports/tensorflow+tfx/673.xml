	<summary>Model Validator cannot find Trainer output</summary>
	<description>
The error in ModelValidator is: Could not find directory gs://.../Trainer/output/12/eval_model_dir. Looks like the Trainer wrote to gs://.../Trainer/output/150/eval_model_dir...
Running on GKE with kubeflow version 0.6.2. Not using any custom components.

		ModelValidator is trying to find previous blessed model to compare with current model, it looks like previous model are deleted

		Right, I cleared my tfx output directories because I didn't think it would affect subsequent pipeline runs. Is there a way to fix this model referencing issue without nuking my kubeflow deployment?

		one hack way to fix this is copy the current trainer ouput eval model to the blessed model path recorded in metadata, or drop the entire metadata (you will lose all tracking information)
