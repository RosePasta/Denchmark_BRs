	<summary>BigQueryExampleGen handles arrays incorrectly</summary>
	<description>
As I also tried to address &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/pull/1731&gt;in my PR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 including a BigQuery array in the query result for BigQueryExamplesGen will result in the following error.

I suspect this is because how the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/05ba51906408f96570f2be5975d687b1d40dee9d/tfx/components/example_gen/big_query_example_gen/executor.py#L42&gt;initial type parsing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 only checks the main type and not if it is a repeatable or not .
A quick fix as in the PR would be to check if it is a list before parsing it through.
For now a workaround would be to query the elements of the array separately, but this tedious solution if you have long array and I think TFX should complain instead of crash if it doesn't want to you use arrays.
