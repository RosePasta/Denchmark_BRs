	<summary>Workshop tutorial bug: unexpected keyword argument 'components'</summary>
	<description>
The commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/commit/7541df5f3e4dd9b2237b3105b0784f640249efc4&gt;7541df5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seems to break the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/workshop&gt;TFX Developer Tutorial&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in step 2, when executing:
# Open a new terminal window, and in that window ...
source ~/tfx-env/bin/activate
airflow webserver -p 8080
It outputs the error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[2019-04-25 18:57:19,644] {__init__.py:416} ERROR - Failed to import: /home/j3soon/airflow/dags/taxi_pipeline_solution.py

My partner following the tutorial last week and it works perfectly. However, when I'm trying to follow the tutorial again on the same machine yesterday, the error occurs.
After replacing the file /home/j3soon/airflow/dags/taxi_pipeline_solution.py with the old file, the error is resolved.

		Thanks for reporting this. I tried at my end and found the same error with the latest tutorial version. We will look into it.

		This error is caused by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/commit/7541df5f3e4dd9b2237b3105b0784f640249efc4&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 commit which added an extra argument in the  function in . However, the tutorial still pins to our first release version which is not compatible. We will have a PR to fix this soon.
