	<summary>Bug: Deleted tfx/BUILD after git clone</summary>

I cloned this repo without problems yesterday (or maybe 14th) so guessing something has happened between that timeframe.
My env:

Mac OS X 10.15
git 2.18.0

As far as I'm aware there are no git hooks in the tfx repo, I got a co-worker to recreate this on his machine so don't think it's my laptop unless I missed some requirement I need to pre-install.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I was investigating &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/github/kubeflow/pipelines/jobs/361767089&gt;this build failure&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for  so guessing it may be affecting the Travis CI build machines too.

		Even stranger looks like any attempts I make to run git reset fail and actually make it a different error 😓 :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; ~/Code/kubeflow/tfx   master ●  git reset --hard
HEAD is now at 22b50ab6 Merge pull request #2104 from 18jeffreyma:master

	deleted:    tfx/build/gen_proto.sh

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also can't seem to get rid of these unstaged changes using git checkout -- tfx/BUILD 😕

		Looking through the commits going to guess this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/commit/96a3f4fa81e6f02e49c698e9bd216a13925b69b3&gt;96a3f4f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Apologies if I've missed something I needed to do.

In case this matters I'm using a pretty old version of Bazel to ensure it can work with the kubeflow/pipelines repo:

yep, we changed our local debugging processed (above PR updates the instruction), bazel is now needed

Apologies if I've missed something I needed to do.
