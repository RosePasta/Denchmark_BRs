	<summary>TFX Example_Gen Produce RuntimeError</summary>
	<description>
I've been getting the following error when I run context.run(example_gen) , and I like to understand what does it mean and how can I avoid getting the error. Please advice and thanks in advance!
Error: RuntimeError: Files in same split /home/jupyter/.../data/* have different header.
The data is a csv with headers of "A,B,C,D"
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from  tfx.proto import example_gen_pb2

base_dir = '/home/jupyter/.../data/'
#Input has a single split 'input_dir/*
#Output 2 splits: train:eval=3:1.'
output = example_gen_pb2.Output(
            split_config=example_gen_pb2.SplitConfig(splits=[
                example_gen_pb2.SplitConfig.Split(name='train', hash_buckets=3),
                example_gen_pb2.SplitConfig.Split(name='eval', hash_buckets=1)
            ]))

examples = csv_input(os.path.join(base_dir))
example_gen = CsvExampleGen(input=examples, output_config=output)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		All csv files should have the same header, there might be other files that matches the pattern with different header

 Thanks for your reply. However, there is only one csv file in the folder.

 To go around it, I had to delete the data folder, and recreate and reupload the CSV file for it to pick up. However, after running for another few more rounds, the error comes back again. There is only 1 CSV file in the folder.

Hi. If you're running on Jupyter notebook, do you mind checking the hidden file under the working directory? It's very likely auto-generated checkpoint files can pollute the environment.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/numerology&gt;@numerology&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, yes I'm running on Jupyter notebook. I have a look and there is no other CSV file stands out, however, to avoid that, what is the best practice?

Hi @numerology, yes I'm running on Jupyter notebook. I have a look and there is no other CSV file stands out, however, to avoid that, what is the best practice?

Just to clarify, it does not have to be a CSV file, any arbitrary file will be picked by the TFX IO logic. And to prevent this, my best bet will be to ensure base_dir does not contain any .ipynb file.

, thanks for your suggestion. Let me reorganize my directory to ensure that doesn't happen. Thanks again.
