	<summary>KeyError: 'component_id'</summary>
	<description>
With a build from master latest commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/commit/c9c7ecc64fa050677c33d05038f4054b558e0eef&gt;c9c7ecc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If I run a Kubeflow pipeline I got this from modelvalidator:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tfx-src/tfx/orchestration/kubeflow/container_entrypoint.py", line 102, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "/tfx-src/tfx/orchestration/kubeflow/container_entrypoint.py", line 98, in main
    executor.run()
  File "/opt/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tfx/orchestration/kubeflow/executor_wrappers.py", line 123, in run
    self._exec_properties)
  File "/opt/venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tfx/components/model_validator/executor.py", line 166, in Do
    component_id = exec_properties['component_id']
KeyError: 'component_id'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It's probably a bug but I'm not sure how to fix it. Any help will be appreciated.

		Thanks for bringing up the issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/valeriano-manassero&gt;@valeriano-manassero&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ! This bug is caused by the facts:

Kubeflow currently bypasses driver and publisher but only invokes executor
Model Validator executor references to a execution property that is populated by its driver

We will have a fix soon.

		This should be fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/commit/6283fffb3ac81e2f213b4895fbe19623dfa9c4f5&gt;6283fff&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I can confirm bug is fixed.
Btw, with current master, for docker image build to be succesfull, we should fix a third party license import.
I already created this: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/pull/426&gt;#426&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Anyone can review it pls?
