		I suggest is to pin the version of airflow, Werkzueg and Flask.
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/commit/711a9d899324de4b7207c04ecd905872bdcd2e9e&gt;711a9d8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for an example.
Please let me know if it works.

		This is an issue with Airflow 1.13.0 which didn't correctly pin the version of Flask: &lt;denchmark-link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-4900&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-4900&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you've already installed airflow 1.13, you should be able to resolve this with
pip install --upgrade Flask

No module named 'werkzeug.wrappers.json'

Did you try: pip install -U Werkzeug or try installing 0.14

		I would suggest try pinning related softwares to a known good version: pip
install apache-airflow==1.10.3 Flask==1.0.4 Werkzeug==0.14.1
&lt;denchmark-link:#&gt;…&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
