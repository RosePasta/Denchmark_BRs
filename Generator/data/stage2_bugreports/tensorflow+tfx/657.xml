	<summary>Trainer component crashed in an execution on Kubeflow on GCP</summary>
	<description>
/kind bug
I was running &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/examples/chicago_taxi_pipeline/taxi_pipeline_kubeflow.py&gt;the TFX ml pipeline of the Chicago taxi example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on Kubeflow 0.6.2 which was deployed to GCP by the UI deployment tool. I used TFX 0.14.0 for compiling DAG dsl. When it came to the trainer component execution,  the component crashed.
The logs in Kubeflow says:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;INFO:googleapiclient.discovery:URL being requested: POST

Details: "[{'@type': 'type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.BadRequest', 'fieldViolations': [{'field': 'master_config.image_uri', 'description': 'Failed to read the container uri [gcr.io/tfx-oss-public/tfx:0.14.0], Please make sure that the image exists and CloudML Engine service account has access to it.'}]}]"&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As the error message said, there is not a container  but , ,  and so on. (&lt;denchmark-link:https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/tfx-oss-public/GLOBAL/tfx?tag=0.14.0&amp;gcrImageListsize=30&gt;https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/tfx-oss-public/GLOBAL/tfx?tag=0.14.0&amp;gcrImageListsize=30&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
And I found the following line in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/extensions/google_cloud_ai_platform/runner.py#L36&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/extensions/google_cloud_ai_platform/runner.py#L36&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

_TFX_IMAGE = 'gcr.io/tfx-oss-public/tfx:%s' % (version.__version__)
It seems that this is the part to be fixed?

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mesaverde0207&gt;@mesaverde0207&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for filing this issue!
Something went wrong with our internal image release process. We're fixing it. In the meantime, we've pushed the image gcr.io/tfx-oss-public/tfx:0.14.0, so custom containers on AI Platform training should work. Would you be willing to try this again and let us know if this works for you? Thanks!

		Thank you for pushing a new container image!
The master_config.image_uri Error does no longer happen.
