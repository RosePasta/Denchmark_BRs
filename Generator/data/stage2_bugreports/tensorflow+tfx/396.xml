Hi There!
I am following &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/tree/master/tfx/examples/chicago_taxi_pipeline&gt;Chicago Taxi Pipeline&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 example steps. While running  I am getting following error:

 This might be that you're running beam on Python 2.7, but the code you're using in Python 3.5. Please upgrade your local virtuanenv to Python 3 and update.
Maybe the docs need to be updated?

Please provide details about what platform you are using (operating system, architecture). Also include your TensorFlow version. Also, did you compile from source or install a binary?
Make sure you also include the exact command if possible to produce the output included in your test case. If you are unclear what to include see the issue template displayed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new/choose&gt;the Github new issue template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We ask for this in the issue submission template, because it is really difficult to help without that information. Thanks!

 I am following the exact steps and version of the softwares mentioned in the example documentation. I am using Python 2.7 and here are the versions of other softwares:

tensorflow - 1.13.1
docker - 4.0.1
apache-airflow - 1.10.3
tfx - 0.13.0

Should I use Python 3? If so, what shall be the versions of other required softwares?

		Hi all, I've also been working through the Chicago Taxi example using Python 3 but hitting ImportErrors for Apache Beam.  This is using the exact steps outlined in the README, on OSX Mojave:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "taxi_pipeline_simple.py", line 31, in &lt;module&gt;
    from tfx.components.transform.component import Transform
  File "/Users/XXXX/taxi_pipeline/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tfx/components/transform/component.py", line 24, in &lt;module&gt;
    from tfx.components.transform import executor
  File "/Users/XXXX/taxi_pipeline/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tfx/components/transform/executor.py", line 30, in &lt;module&gt;
    from tensorflow_transform.beam import analyzer_cache
ImportError: cannot import name 'analyzer_cache' from 'tensorflow_transform.beam' (/Users/XXXX/taxi_pipeline/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_transform/beam/__init__.py)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It doesn't seem that the Chicago Taxi example is runnable in the tfx repo's current state.  I believe Python 2 is recommended because Apache Beam is not yet compatible with Python 3, however the type annotations that were recently added are incompatible with Python 2.
Any thoughts on the best way to proceed?  I suppose removing the type annotations and using Python 2, or waiting for Beam to be compatible with Python 3, but any other clever thoughts?
 I'm attempting to run taxi_pipeline_simply.py using Python 2 and removing the type annotations.  I encounter an ImportError from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/examples/chicago_taxi_pipeline/taxi_pipeline_simple.py#L38&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
ImportError: cannot import name external_input
  File "/Users/XXXX/taxi_pipeline/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/models/__init__.py", line 413, in process_file

    from tfx.utils.dsl_utils import external_input
ImportError: cannot import name external_input
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The README states that tfx==0.13.0 should be installed using pip.  However, this version does not include the external_input() function in dsl_utils.py.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/colson1111&gt;@colson1111&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it looks like we are being broken at head by differences in the API for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/transform&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/transform&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  This is a known issue and we are working on making this dependency work better.  Right now, the workaround is to build and install that package at head; you can also install the one-off nightly build here from test-pypi: &lt;denchmark-link:https://test.pypi.org/project/tensorflow-transform-nightly/#files&gt;https://test.pypi.org/project/tensorflow-transform-nightly/#files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install https://test-files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4b/02/14ef3dc3d8d05b1999721add1a2812a8031cd91573ab29a6cdeb66939b97/tensorflow-transform-nightly-0.14.0.dev20190726.tar.gz

		Has anyone been able to get this to work?  I also tried what &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/colson1111&gt;@colson1111&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggested to remove the Python 3 type annotations and also used the nightly build suggested by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/charlesccychen&gt;@charlesccychen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  but there are still a slew of issues pertaining to Python 2 vs 3 and/or Tensorflow/TFX.  Given Apache Beam does not work with Python 3, is it safe to assume this taxi pipeline example cannot actually "work"?  Any ideas are appreciated

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ahsanshah&gt;@ahsanshah&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/colson1111&gt;@colson1111&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this works for me on Python 3.  Processing with Apache Beam on Python 3 also works just fine, though it is still not certified as stably supported in the current release.  What has worked for me is:

Create and enter a new Python 3 virtualenv.
Install TFX and Tensorflow using pip install https://test-files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4b/02/14ef3dc3d8d05b1999721add1a2812a8031cd91573ab29a6cdeb66939b97/tensorflow-transform-nightly-0.14.0.dev20190726.tar.gz tensorflow==1.14.0
Download the sample data and run the example.

Can you let me know what step fails in your environment?

		The problem is the docs are "published" but versions that work aren't.
I found the same problems.  First off, use python 3.  The TFX docs say not to, BEAM gives warnings while running, but it does work.  In terms of version, as mentioned above, the online docs do not work with the 'pip' versions.  Basically use pip tf-nightly and manually install protoc.  Then install nightly tfx: git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx.git using setup.py.
That method worked, so I suspect &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/issues/396#issuecomment-517609019&gt;#396 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will also work.  I wanted to mention how I did it but the best way would be the use the response by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/charlesccychen&gt;@charlesccychen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 above.

		Thanks.  I did try the steps (or the combination of steps) outlined by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robertlugg&gt;@robertlugg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/charlesccychen&gt;@charlesccychen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .  The issue seems to be with Airflow. I still get errors on the Airflow side such as:

ERROR - Cannot use more than 1 thread when using sqlite. Setting parallelism to 1
File "/u00/TFX3/taxi_pipeline/lib/python3.5/abc.py", line 225, in subclasscheck
for scls in cls.subclasses():
TypeError: descriptor 'subclasses' of 'type' object needs an argument

Were you able to get Airflow working properly with TFX?  I assume yes?  I may need to further dig into why its not working on my end.

 Yes, I was able to use the steps from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/charlesccychen&gt;@charlesccychen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (along with the git clone +  step from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robertlugg&gt;@robertlugg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) to get the example pipeline to run in Airflow.  I am using a python3.7 virtualenv.

ImportError: cannot import name 'external_input'

I followed the steps mentioned on  &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/workshop&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/workshop&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and still found the same problem. The workaround for me is to clone the r0.13 branch of tfx.

		Yes that is the right thing to do. Because we are still in 0.x versions and occasionally introduces breaking changes, we will ensure examples cloned from each released branch works with the released package version, and back port fixes if necessary.
