	<summary>Colab InteractiveContext Unable to Determine ProjectID for BQ</summary>
	<description>
When trying to use TFX in Colab, specifically the BigQueryExampleGen, there is an issue where we get the following error regarding the GCP project_id:
"Project was not passed and could not be determined from the environment."
gcloud config list shows the project is recognized, so the issue is within the last, or second-to-last line.
Perhaps there is a parameter within  InteractiveContext() or BigQueryExampleGen(), but I couldn't find any documentation on this. Is there a way to specify the project_id in any of these functions? Or is this a bug?
Below is the exact replica of the issue:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from tfx.orchestration.experimental.interactive.interactive_context import InteractiveContext
from tfx.components.example_gen.big_query_example_gen.component import BigQueryExampleGen
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.colab import auth

auth.authenticate_user( )
project_id = 'Project-ID'
!gcloud config set project {project_id}
!gcloud config list


context = InteractiveContext()

QUERY = '''
SELECT * 
FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips` 
LIMIT 1000
'''
example_gen = BigQueryExampleGen(query=QUERY )
context.run(example_gen)

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Could you try following the instruction &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and set up the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS in your env?

		Yes I did, and it still doesn't seem to work. It seems it's an issue with InteractiveContext that the actual credentials. This issue can be replicated in a Colab notebook as well, after you fully authenticate you env.

		are you able to run the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/examples/chicago_taxi_pipeline/taxi_pipeline_kubeflow_gcp.py&gt;gcp example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 without InteractiveContext or Colab?
another simple way to verify is try to see if you can do the bigquery helloworld &lt;denchmark-link:https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in your colab env?

		So far, yes. The issue appears only when running this in a notebook with the BigQueryExampleGen. The CsvExampleGen works. Here is the issue that appears, even using the suggestion above.

		(edited) Can you try setting your project ID with the following code?
import os
os.environ['GCLOUD_PROJECT'] = '&lt;your project name&gt;'
And then verifying that it shows up with
os.getenv('GCLOUD_PROJECT')

		Thanks, it looks like the long-term solution will be to pipe in beam_pipeline_args through context.run().  A workaround right now is to do the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from apache_beam.internal.gcp import auth
auth.executing_project = '&lt;your project name&gt;'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that there is no compatibility guarantee for this workaround.

		It seems it does not work. So currently there is no way to add to beam_pipeline_args through context.run()? I presume InteractiveContext is using PipelineOptions() with a DirectRunner right?

		I have proposed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/pull/888&gt;#888&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to make this work.  With that change, you would be able to do .
To be clear on your last comment, are you saying that setting auth.executing_project does not work?
