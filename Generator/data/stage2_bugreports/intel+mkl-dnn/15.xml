	<summary>mkl-dnn engine crash on cpu without avx2 support</summary>
	<description>
It's known that the mkl-dnn engine not support machines without avx2.
But the engine will crash with "illegal instructionâ€œ.
Users will not happy to see the program crash.
Rather than crash, should the engine  still work on  machine without  avx2 support ?
Maybe use other instruction set instead of avx2 when no avx2 support ?

		You are right, mkl-dnn should not crash on cpus w/o avx2. There is already a patch in the queue that fixes this. It will be pushed to github soon.
