	<description>
I builded intel caffe successed wilth mkl-dnn(commit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/commit/47bda9503f669c0e08ac84fea3f6e7aa05991b72&gt;47bda95&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This probably needs to be filed against intel caffe (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel/caffe&gt;https://github.com/intel/caffe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Two teams are collaborating on the mkl-dnn support, but the library changes faster than the support code in the framework.
Can I summon &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jreniecki&gt;@jreniecki&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 into this thread?

		Also, let me try reproducing this on my end. Maybe there's a quick fix we can make to resolve this.

		Okay. The build fails due to the change in the batch normalization API. This is a known issue, and the update to the intelcaffe is in the works. I'm inclined to close this issue since there's nothing we can do in the mkl-dnn source code to fix it.
