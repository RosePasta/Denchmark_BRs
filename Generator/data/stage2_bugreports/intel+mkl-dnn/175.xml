	<summary>Corner case crash when batch size of tensor is 0</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is a test case created a memory shape like (0, 16, 8, 8), then MKL-DNN will crash at nd_iterator_init (in reorder or other primitives). Quick fix would be compare start and end and found out there was nothing to calculate and then bailout earlier or fix nd_iterator_init to skip mode 0.
I know this is very rare and probability never happen in real situation, however change testcase of a framework seems also a bad option.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Linux/OS X, general
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

reorder from a(0, 16, 8, 8) to b (0, 16, 8, 8).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Actual behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Crash in nd_iterator_init
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Nothing happen and finish sucessfully

		This is kind of embarrassing... Thanks for the report!

		Which formats you are converting from / to and which compiler and MKL-DNN version do you use? I can make MKL-DNN fail when converting nhwc to chwn with icc but the backtrace does not point me to nd_iterator_init().

		Oh I see, you go to the ref.
Mine: Reorder from nchw to nchw. homebrew llvm/clang 5.0, direct_copy except dim0.
It seems my ref path is good even on Linux with icpc-18 or gcc.
