	<summary>small error when compiling with DNNL_VERBOSE turned off</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When compiling the latest commit in the master branch I get an error when DNNL_VERBOSE is turned off. It's something that's easy to fix:
in verbose.cpp line 130
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#if defined(DISABLE_VERBOSE)
void pd_info_t::init(const primitive_desc_t *) {}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

should be:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#if defined(DISABLE_VERBOSE)
void pd_info_t::init(engine_t *, const primitive_desc_t *) {}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

thanks

		Confirmed. Broken in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/commit/57a98fb6de4b6b9773f70343eba864098c634ab9&gt;57a98fb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zulma46&gt;@zulma46&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for the report. We will fix the issue soon.
But regardless of that, may I know why you build oneDNN with VERBOSE off? Is it because of the slowdown in primitive creation? I want to note that we recently (in DNNL v1.3) made verbose lazy-initialized, so if you don't set DNNL_VERBOSE to 1 or 2 you won't observe any perf differences.

		Hi,
Yes, I turned VERBOSE off for performance reasons. I wasn't aware this is no longer necessary.
Thanks for letting me know.

		Yeah, there was a bunch of micro optimizations made to accelerate primitive descriptor creation. The commit that made verbose initialization lazy is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/commit/9d5e7671eb4bc6e496560bd5f658fbff647562a3&gt;9d5e767&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
