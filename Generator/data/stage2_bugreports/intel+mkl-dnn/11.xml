	<summary>weight or src at simple_net?</summary>
	<description>
I think I found an error at line:89 of examples/simple_net.cpp.
Maybe it should be conv_prim_desc.weights_primitive_desc(), not conv_prim_desc.src_primitive_desc().
What's weird is that both can pass the test, why?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensor-tang&gt;@tensor-tang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for pointing to this issue. You are right, this is a typo indeed.
The test passes for two reasons:

reorder doesn't check consistency of input and output memory
there is no actual check of the obtained result, so even the result is garbage the example is care...

Will fix this soon. Thanks!
