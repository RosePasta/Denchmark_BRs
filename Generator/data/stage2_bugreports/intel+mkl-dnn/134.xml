	<summary>test_sum failed with random input data</summary>
	<description>
Since mkldnn::sum tested some &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/01org/mkl-dnn/blob/master/tests/gtests/test_sum.cpp#L149&gt;cases &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 like from format  and  to , I thought it should be supported now.
But when I use real data by uncommenting the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/01org/mkl-dnn/blob/master/tests/gtests/test_sum.cpp#L102&gt;fill_data&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the gtest failed.
The reason gtest passed before is that all data used same value for (ptrdiff_t j = 0; j &lt; sz; ++j) s[j] = static_cast&lt;data_t&gt;(i + 1);.
Seems mkldnn::sum do not support the cases with different src and dst format yet, right?
So the cases are fake test or just have not finished?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensor-tang&gt;@tensor-tang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
It's a shame about the test... :(
Of course it is a typo, the data should be different for different places in a memory.
mkldnn::sum ought to work with different input layouts.
Basically that is the main purpose of the primitive -- avoiding unnecessary conversions.
Thanks for catching that. Will take a look!
