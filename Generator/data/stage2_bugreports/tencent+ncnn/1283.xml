	<summary>Im2col implementation of 3x3 stride 2 convolution produces incorrect result</summary>
	<description>
I found that the im2col implementation of the 3x3 conv with stride 2 called here:



ncnn/src/layer/arm/convolution_arm.cpp


         Line 1236
      in
      6703286






 conv_im2col_sgemm_neon(bottom_blob_bordered, top_blob, weight_sgemm_data, bias_data, kernel_w, kernel_h, stride_w, stride_h, opt); 





Produces 1 incorrect pixel (at index 40) in every output channel when being run on a 14x14x20 input with SAME padding and producing a 7x7x42 output. A quick work around is disabling the im2col and always using conv3x3s2_packed_neon which produces the correct results.

		I suggest that add result check in auto pack model.
Now that convolution could be implemented with multiple approach, we can compare different methods' result.
