	<summary>throw exception when load bin&amp;params are not correctly ordered.</summary>
	<description>
In my test, there will be a crash in extractor when net object execute load_model earlier then load_param.
It's a good choice to throw an exception in this case during load phase,  to avoid unnecessary debugging efforts.
