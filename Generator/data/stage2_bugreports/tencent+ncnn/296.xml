	<summary>got weird results from squeezenet model ?</summary>
	<description>
i built test example with source code from examples/squeezenet.cpp, but got weird results with any images as below:
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;./test_ncnn plane.jpg&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

0 = 0.000000
0 = 0.000000
0 = 0.000000
i built test_ncnn with linking opencv3 and prebuilt libncnn.a using ndk13b, and below is my ndk makefile:
LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
#libncnn.a
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := libncnn
LOCAL_SRC_FILES :=$(LOCAL_PATH)/../../arm64-v8a/libncnn.a
include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)
#libomp.a
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := libomp
LOCAL_SRC_FILES :=$(LOCAL_PATH)/../../arm64-v8a/libomp.a
include $(PREBUILT_STATIC_LIBRARY)
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
#opencv
OPENCV_INSTALL_MODULES := on
OPENCV_CAMERA_MODULES := off
#OPENCV_LIB_TYPE := SHARE
include ${LOCAL_PATH}/../../3rdparty/opencv/native/jni/OpenCV.mk
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../include \
$(LOCAL_PATH)/../../3rdparty/opencv/native/jni/include \
LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/../../src/test.cpp \
LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += libncnn \
libomp
LOCAL_CFLAGS += -O0 -g
LOCAL_MODULE    := test_ncnn
include $(BUILD_EXECUTABLE)

		I may have made some mistakes during packing binary.
The prebuilt package has been removed currently.
sorry for the inconvenience. I will inform you once update occurs.  :)

, never mind for a known issue, this is also my laziness. Looking forward to the next released version. I will try to rebuild ncnn with source code in my environment.
