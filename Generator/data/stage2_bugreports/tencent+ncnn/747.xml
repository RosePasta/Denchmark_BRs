	<summary>size_t issue in func. load_param_bin</summary>
	<description>
In func. load_param_bin at net.cpp, readValue is used to get value of param as the follows:
size_t layer_count = 0; if (!readValue(layer_count, fp)) return -1;
These codes doesn't get the correct lenth of param value. Since in 64bit system, size_t means 8 bytes. But the params in param.bin are all dumped in 4 bytes format (int type) by ncnn2mem.
Thus in 64 bit platform, program will crash while loading param.bin.
