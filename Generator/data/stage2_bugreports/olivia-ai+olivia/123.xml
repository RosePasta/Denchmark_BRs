	<summary>Installation/setup issues</summary>
	<description>
Hi! Would really appreciate some help with setting up the project. I have got it running on my machine with docker, but I just get a 404 on localhost:8080
Describe the bug
I get a 404 Page not found error starting Olivia with the yml file using docker-compose up
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61279302/83661041-dfcb3b80-a5c5-11ea-9c4c-854b74929982.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To Reproduce
Follow the installation instructions in the readme
Expected behavior
For it to start the frontend. It seems it starts but gives a 404. Not sure how to fix.
Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Mac High Sierra 10.13.6
Browser: Brave, Chrome, Safari
Version: 3

Additional context
Console print below. It mentions a warning about VUE_APP_URL, however I haven't been able to reproduce it again. Might have something to do with it..
