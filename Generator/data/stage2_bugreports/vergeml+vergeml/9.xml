	<summary>2 images in cats and dog dataset are corrupt</summary>
	<description>
I have the issue that 2 images in the cat and dog dataset are corrupt. I'm not sure if this issuye belong here but I'm not able to complete the Quickstart because of that. The following files are corrupt (empty files):

cats/666.jpg
dogs/11702.jpg

Both files are empty and training the files causes errors.

		This is a bug, the download script should have deleted these images.
To continue with the quickstart, you can simply delete the images.

		I think it was a problem with my system and not vergeML. My pip installation was broken too and I've got an error on downloading the samples:
