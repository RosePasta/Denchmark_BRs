	<summary>Error in the tiny yolo v2 model</summary>
	<description>
I was trying out the tiny yolo v2 model, when I came across a strange error. Apparently, there exist a convolution.W key, which is called without being initialized. Can someone tell me the reason behind this?

 Could you please re-generate the model and let &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ayush1999&gt;@ayush1999&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 test again?

 seems to address the same issue regarding initializers. It was resolved in the following two discussions:
