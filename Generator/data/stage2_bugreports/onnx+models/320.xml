	<summary>MNIST opset 1 is missing opset_import IR component</summary>
	<description>
Seeing this issue upon loading MNIST opset 1. Looks like a missing opset_import attribute at the ModelProto level.
Failed to load model with error: Missing opset in the model. All ModelProtos MUST have at least one entry that specifies which version of the ONNX OperatorSet is being imported.

		I have a new mnist model that converted from tensorflow, with same functionality but bigger model size(6.3MB vs 26KB). And I believe it will solve the issue and supports more opsets because TF converter is actively maintained, but CNTK is dead. If you wants the new model, please let me know.
