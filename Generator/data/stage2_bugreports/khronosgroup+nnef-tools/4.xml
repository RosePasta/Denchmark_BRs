	<summary>Caffe to NNEF converter is producing incorrect NNEF structure file</summary>
	<description>
Below is the example that I used for this test: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/cifar10/cifar10_quick.prototxt&gt;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/cifar10/cifar10_quick.prototxt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The caffe export script is using 'deploy.desc' filename instead of 'graph.nnef' filename specified in Section 5.1 of the spec.
Generated text is not valid per the nnef-validator.

		You are right that the file name is incorrect, that's an easy fix.
However, I cannot see the problem with the generated text. Can you post the error message? On my side the validator accepts it. What are the command-line arguments for the validator execution? Doesn't it fail upon checking the data files and it may be related to the other issue?

		With the most recent commit, I see that it is creating 'graph.nnef' file instead of 'deploy.desc'.
One issue is still left. The converter is generating 5L which is not legal syntax.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;conv1_filter = variable(label = 'conv1/filter', shape = [32, 3, 5L, 5L])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Added a branch fix_int_literal to treat this issue, can you test it on your side?
