	<summary>Experiment didn't stop after encountering a critical error (user environment missing tensorflow)</summary>
	<description>
Create an clean Azure VM (Ubuntu 16.04), and follow the Getting Started instruction to try nni, followed the following commands:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip3 install -v --user git+https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git@v0.1
source ~/.bashrc
nnictl create --config ~/nni/examples/trials/mnist-annotation/config.yml
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and found the below error from ~/nni/experiments/I4eOAq5y/trials/lis4f/stderr
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "mnist.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    import tensorflow as tf
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I found that it is because I missed the requirements tensorflow installed from instruction, so I tried to install tensorflow with pip3 install tensorflow, after that, when I try to run the
nnictl create --config ~/nni/examples/trials/mnist-annotation/config.yml
command again, but it promotes
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Info: Checking experiment...
Error: There is an experiment running, please stop it first...
Info: You can use 'nnictl stop' command to stop an experiment!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I need manually run nnictl stop to stop the experiment, and create it again.
Why didn't the experiment stop after a critical error?

		Close it because it's by design behavior.
