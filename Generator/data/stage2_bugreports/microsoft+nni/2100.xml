	<summary>Invalid typeof check in observableTimer</summary>
	<description>
Short summary about the issue/question:
The unsubscribe method is doing an invalid typeof check:



nni/src/nni_manager/common/observableTimer.ts


         Line 22
      in
      ff2728c






 if(typeof subscription !== undefined) { 





typeof undefined !== undefined
// true

typeof undefined === 'undefined'
// true
Brief what process you are following:
Nothing, I was just reading through the codebase :)
Anything else we need to know:
ESLint is already configured to use the "recommended" preset which has the valid-typeof, so maybe this was introduced before ESLint was setup.

   Thanks for your good catch, will you send a PR to fix it? The intention was to check whether subscription is undefined. It is a mistake.
