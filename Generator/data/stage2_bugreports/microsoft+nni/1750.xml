	<summary>Potential typo in sklearn example</summary>
	<description>
There is a potential typo in the sklearn trail example:
I was looking at the example provided to run the sklearn trail, and I noticed in the 'main.py' file,  the 'run' function takes PARAM as one of the input, should it be model instead?
def run(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, PARAMS):
    '''Train model and predict result'''
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predict_y = model.predict(X_test)
    score = r2_score(y_test, predict_y)
    LOG.debug('r2 score: %s' % score)
    nni.report_final_result(score)

# When executing
run(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, model)
Maybe I understand something wrong here, any clarification would be appreciated?
Thanks and great work!
