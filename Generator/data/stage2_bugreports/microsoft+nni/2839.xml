	<summary>Is StackedLSTMCell correct implementation?</summary>
	<description>
For enas, StackedLSTMCell is implemented as below



nni/src/sdk/pynni/nni/nas/pytorch/enas/mutator.py


        Lines 23 to 28
      in
      bf8be1e






 curr_c, curr_h = m(inputs, (prev_c[i], prev_h[i])) 



 next_c.append(curr_c) 



 next_h.append(curr_h) 



 # current implementation only supports batch size equals 1, 



 # but the algorithm does not necessarily have this limitation 



 inputs = curr_h[-1].view(1, -1) 





nn.LSTMCell outputs (hidden state, cell state) but the order of output is changed in the implementation.
As a result, the cell state is used for output of LSTM.
Is this an intention or wrong implementation?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jyh2986&gt;@jyh2986&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Thanks for asking.
If you are right, the implementation is definitely buggy. You can raise a PR. Meanwhile, I'll check the PyTorch documentation for verification. Thanks.
