	<summary>Temporary dir for gpu collection is not always unique among users</summary>
	<description>
Short summary about the issue/question:
When running NNI, it puts the gpu metrics collector in /tmp/nni/script, which is not unique among users. So two people cannot run NNI simultaneously (for example on different GPU).
Brief what process you are following:
User 1: runs NNI fine
User 2: runs NNI on different port, but it'll give status error: "Training service error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/tmp/nni/script/gpu_metrics_collector.sh'"
How to reproduce it:
See above
nni Environment:

nni version: 1.0 (but also present in HEAD)
nni mode(local|pai|remote): local
OS: Ubuntu 18.04LTS
python version: 3.6
is conda or virtualenv used?:  Yes (conda)
is running in docker?: We run it in Singularity (github.com/sylabs/singularity/), with mounted /tmp as our containers itself are read-only. Redefining /tmp is not an option unfortunately (breaks too many other things it seems). Our containers are self-made from a ubuntu base, with conda, then pip install nni

need to update document(yes/no):
Maybe
Anything else we need to know:
Bug can be traced to line 435 - 437 of /src/nni_manager/training_service/remote_machine/remoteMachineTrainingService.ts
Clearly path.basename(os.homedir()); doesn't expand to username in our configuration, even though os.homedir() should work in our containers (homedir is mounted).
A solution would be to use either (/var)/run/user/$PID/, create a /tmp/$PID/ or add a random nonce to the path (for example trial id). Another solution would be allowing to specify your own temporary dir. Upstream at nodejs there might also be a fix possible to use the temporary dir supplied by systemd.
