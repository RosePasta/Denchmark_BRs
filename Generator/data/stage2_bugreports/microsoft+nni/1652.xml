	<summary>Tensorflow version pruner not working</summary>
	<description>
Run tf pruner example:
python main_tf_pruner.py
I got following messages:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
WARNING:tensorflow:From main_tf_pruner.py:66: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.

See `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.

After some debugging,  I found that calc_mask interface in Pruner class is not called.
I tried 2 systems, got same problem.

		This is a known issue with TF 1.0, but not a problem with TF 2.0.
