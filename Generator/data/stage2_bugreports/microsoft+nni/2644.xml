	<summary>nnictl command not found(may be because of failing to add the necessary environment variable)</summary>
	<description>
Environment:

NNI version: v1.7 testpkg
NNI mode (local|remote|pai): local
Client OS: ubuntu18.04, windows10
Server OS (for remote mode only):
Python version: 3.6
PyTorch/TensorFlow version: not used
Is conda/virtualenv/venv used?: no
Is running in Docker?: no

Log message:

command line: nnictl command not found

What issue meet, what's expected?:
After installing nniv1.7, the command "nnictl *" command can't be used directly. The error 'nnictl command not found' is caused and no warning about this problem emerging in the log. But when I manually add "/home/user/.local/bin" to the path variable, the 'nnictl *' command can be used normally.
How to reproduce it?:
The specific condition to cause this problem haven't been comfirmed.   '/home/user/.local/bin' is not in the path after installing.
Additional information:
The nni version is v1.7 and the OS version is ubuntu 18.04.  The os is newly installed.

		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/linbinskn&gt;@linbinskn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,do you install nni by  or  from source code? By default nni will not add  to your PATH, but it will show an info to suggest you add this path when the installation finished.

Hi, @linbinskn ,do you install nni by pip install or  from source code? By default nni will not add /home/user/.local/bin to your PATH, but it will show an info to suggest you add this path when the installation finished.
