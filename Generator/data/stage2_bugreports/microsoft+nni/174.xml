git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/nni.git
make install-dependencies
make build
make dev-install
nnictl create --config ~/nni/examples/trials/mnist/config.yml

		Hi goooxu
It is recommended for you to update you pip by python3 -m pip install -U pip even you don't need to change your pip version, because it is found that the pip of certain version installed through apt-get has some problems when installing some python dependencies of NNI. Further reason is unclear -- probably pip from these two source is different or the origin pip in your environment is somewhat broken or something else...
If you do want you keep your pip version, you can check your pip_version by python3 -m pip -V and then reinstall it again by python3 -m pip install -U pip==pip_version. This also works.

		Can solve it by using --no-cache-dir flag
