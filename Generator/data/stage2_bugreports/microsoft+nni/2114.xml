		Can you paste the output of nnictl experiment status? We need to know if the whole experiment is dead or it's only a web UI issue.
If the experiment itself is still working, please show us the console output of your browser. You can open the browser console by pressing F12 then clicking the Console tab.

		The output is {
"errors":[],
"status":"RUNNING"
}
Now the detail page can be displayed normally. I found that this problem only occurs when starting a new trial. When nni.report_final_result gets the first value, the page can be opened.

		You can try refresh the page if you run into this problem again.
We will investigate the root cause later. Thanks for your report.
