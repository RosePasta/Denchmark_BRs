	<summary>KeyError: 'logPath' while running remote experiment</summary>
	<description>
While trying to run remote training and then get some info about the status, I get an error from nnicli:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;root# nnictl log trial
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/.pyenv/versions/3.6.8/bin/nnictl", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    sys.exit(parse_args())
  File "/root/.pyenv/versions/3.6.8/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nni_cmd/nnictl.py", line 217, in parse_args
    args.func(args)
  File "/root/.pyenv/versions/3.6.8/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nni_cmd/nnictl_utils.py", line 366, in log_trial
    trial_id_path_dict[trial['id']] = trial['logPath']
KeyError: 'logPath'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Brief what process you are following:
Running an experiment as described in MNIST remote example. It got stuck in a "waiting" status, so I'm trying to request a log - nnictl log trial
How to reproduce it:
nni Environment:

nni version: 1.0
nni mode(local|pai|remote): remote
OS: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
python version: 3.6.8
is conda or virtualenv used?:  no
is running in docker?: yes

need to update document(yes/no): no
Anything else we need to know:
This happens when I try to run experiment using remote mode, but from the same machine (trial and ctl are on the same machine). I see it starts to pack scripts dir with tar and then nothing happens. /tmp contains empty tar files (zero size). In Web UI status of trial keeps being waiting.
