	<summary>hard to debug</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to use annotation in my own code by following the examples and the doc
&lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://microsoft.github.io/nni/docs/howto_1_WriteTrial.html#nni-python-annotation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I just tried adding one variable

"""@nni.variable(nni.choice(0.5, 0.9), name=dropout_rate)"""

and the output

"""@nni.report_final_result(best_score)"""

into my code, and

useAnnotation: true

in config.yml.
When I running the config.yml, the webgui displayed well, but all trials were failed. Becaue all my output to the screen and logger are disappeared (blocked?), I can hardly find where the error is.  Here is a screenshot. I don't know why the default metric are NaNs.

Is there any good way to debug in such case?
Thanks a lot!

		Hi, your output and logger in the trial.py will be redirected to trial.log, whose location is shown in the webui. You can click the '+' in the left of a trial to expand it, and the logpath is shown in the bottom.
BTW, the stderr is also in the same directory

 Thank you very much!
I found the log. Now I am analyzing it!
