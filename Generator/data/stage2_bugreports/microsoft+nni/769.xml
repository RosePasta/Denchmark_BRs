	<summary>Cannot run mnist example with gpu</summary>
	<description>
Hello, nni team!
I executed mnist tutorial with GPU, but none of the trials launched.
(nnictl create --config config_gpu.yml)
When I submit an experiment with non-GPU code(config.yml), it worked.
Is there any way to solve?
Thank you.

		I have encountered the same problem with you. The remote mode is currently available for normal use.

You are using python virtualenv as your local python interpreter, so it is necessary to clain your python path in your config file.
trial:
  codeDir: .
  command: /path/to/virtualenv/python3 example.py
  gpuNum: 1

		@sangloupmonoutlook When I use remote mode, I got such an error.
ERROR: Failed! Error is: {"error":"TrainingService setClusterMetadata timeout. Please check your config file."}

 After I specified my virtualenv's python path, I got a same error

I guess that the local mode works successfully but remote mode does not.
The timeout error shows that there is something wrong with the network connection between your local machine and your remote cluster.
My suggestion: check the network connection between your local machine and your remote cluster. Also, check TCP 8080 port and 8081 port are open.

  - which version are you using? Had you tried upgrade NNI to 0.6, there is a fix in 0.6.

Thanks for your reply, could you tell me how to check the version?
nni.__version__ 
does not work.

		OK, from conda, I found the version is 1.0. I was installing following the tutorial

So the version might not be the problem.
BTW I opened a new issue with detailed description
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/nni/issues/1619&gt;#1619&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Could you help me?
