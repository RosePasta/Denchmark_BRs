	<summary>SMAC cannot have lower bound equal to upper bound</summary>

SMAC does not allow lower bound equal to upper bound. The problem exists for randint, uniform, quniform and loguniform.
Seems that intercepting these kinds of search space with nni is a valid fix.

		For NAS search space converter, optional input size will be converted into a randint field. Fails in SMAC if the size is set to be a constant value.
