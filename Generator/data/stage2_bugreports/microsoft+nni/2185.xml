	<description>
Short summary about the issue/question:
Nnictl tensorboard runs successfully. The interface of tensorboard prompts: No dashboards  are active
Brief what process you are following:

Run this demo: https://github.com/microsoft/nni/tree/master/examples/trials/mnist-keras, the selected configuration file is config.yml
When all experiments are complete, run this command: nnictl  tensorboard start  --trial_id  T4ix3    --port  8089  M2Fc761e

But, The IP---127.0.0.1:8090 displays as follows：

However, I run this command--- “tensorboard --logdir ./train --port 8090 ” and it shows success!


How to reproduce it:
nni Environment:ubuntu18.04

nni version:1.4
nni mode(local|pai|remote):local
OS:ubuntu18.04
python version: 3.6
is conda or virtualenv used?: NO
is running in docker?:NO

need to update document(yes/no):NO

According to the command in the red box, it is clear that the 'logdir' path of  tensorboard is not correct.

Running the command in the figure below still does not show the contents of the tensorboard,The red box shows the logpath.

nnictl trial ls:

If I run this command, tensorboard shows the content:

, could you please using the following command to install NNI, and run an  command again? I've add some debug info in this version of code.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone -b dev-debug https://github.com/SparkSnail/nni.git
cd nni
source install.sh
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		how about tensorboard --logdir name1:/home/{name}/nni/experiments/YUfUzvW7/trials/DtAql --port 8090? I noticed that the only difference between NNI's commands and your command is that NNI's logdir has a name1: before the logdir.

  Ask a question:
if machineList  have two IP , but neither of these IP machines has eth0, so
nniManagerIp can be configured this way:
nniManagerIp : ip1, ip2

@SparkSnail Ask a question:

nniManagerIp can be configured this way:
nniManagerIp : ip1, ip2

Seems that the problem is caused by tensorboard command, your tensorboard does not support adding a name1: before logdir, what is your tensorboard's version?
nniManagerIp can only set one IP address, which is your nniManager machine's IP. machineList has two IPs, do you mean that you run NNI in remote mode? Don't need to set nniManagerIp for remote machines.
