	<summary>BUG in spos evolution part</summary>
	<description>
I trained the spos from scratch with supernet.py, but failed to load the checkpoints. It turned out there was a mismatch between load and save part.
In  the save part  


nni/src/sdk/pynni/nni/nas/pytorch/callbacks.py


         Line 136
      in
      69dfbf5






 state_dict = self.model.state_dict() 




,  no dict was used. But in the load part,  


nni/examples/nas/spos/network.py


         Line 151
      in
      69dfbf5






 for k, v in checkpoint["state_dict"].items(): 




,  key 'state_dict' was used. It failed to load the checkpoint. After removing 'state_dict', checkpoint could be loaded and problem was solved.
