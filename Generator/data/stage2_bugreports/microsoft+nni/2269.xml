	<summary>RangeError: Command too long</summary>
	<description>
Short summary about the issue/question: When an experiment is resumed or large amount of trial data is imported to a running experiment, sometime this error occurs. This is induced by a limitation of ipc protocol between nnimanager and msg_dispatcher, i.e., transmitted data should be no larger than 1MB.
