		This bug is caused because nni create gpu_metric file slower than reading process, so nni will read gpu_metrics file before it is created. NNI will catch this error, and the experiment will continue to run after the gpu_metrics file is created, but there will be an error message in nniManager.log. This bug will be fixed in pr &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/nni/pull/1068&gt;#1068&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
