	<summary>TensorFlow 2.0 API change</summary>
	<description>
TensorFlow 2.0 have significantly changed their API. tensorflow.compat.v1 must be used to make legacy code work.
However this module only appears in latest versions of TensorFlow. And we want to keep NNI compatible with "stable" platforms.
Let's discuss a solution.
An example approach (does not work if user wants to use tf 2.0 features):
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
    tf.disable_v2_behavior()
except (ModuleNotFoundError, AttributeError):
    pass

		This is only partially done.
For example our docker image is still using TF 1.10.
