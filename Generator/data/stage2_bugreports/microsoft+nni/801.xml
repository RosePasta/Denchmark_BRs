	<summary>Getting keyerror using annotation in a class</summary>
	<description>
Short summary about the issue/question:
I'm getting this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/home/xhaojing/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/nni/trial.py", line 53, in get_current_parameter
    return _params['parameters'][tag]
KeyError: 'Reward/failure_reward/choice
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

when I use an annotation in a class imported to my main training file.
This is the code that throws it:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;class Reward:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.Data = data
        """@nni.variable(nni.choice(-1, -0.5, -0.1, -0.01, -0.001, -0.0001), name=failure_reward)"""
        failure_reward = -.01
        self.failure_reward = failure_reward
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

**Brief what process you are following**:  This is a local machine,  **How to reproduce it**:  Instantiate a class (that runs the code above) in a main training script like so:Reward = Reward(data)`
nni Environment:

nni version: 0.5.1
nni mode(local|pai|remote): local
OS: Ubuntu 18
python version: 3.6.7
is conda or virtualenv used?: NO
is running in docker?: NO

		Figured it out.  Some files were in a separate dir from main training file and NNI was looking for lib/some_annotated_var and not some_annotated_var.  Moved files into same dir and everything worked.
I would call it a bug though that you have to have files in the same dir.  Or what am I missing?

		Hi @ &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JohnAllen&gt;@JohnAllen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for reporting this.
It seems that the  library is running differently than expected. Originally we'd like to include it's path in it's key so there won't be two keys with the same name. I'll fix this soon. As you say, currently you can move them into the same dir as a temporary measure
