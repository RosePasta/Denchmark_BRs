	<summary>How to debug?</summary>
	<description>
nni Environment:

nni version: 1.0
nni mode(local|pai|remote): remote
OS: ubuntu16.04
python version: 3.6
is conda or virtualenv used?:  no
is running in docker?: no

I run nni in an environment without graphics, and I get ERROR when running. Because there is no start trial, there is no information under / tmp / nni. At the same time, I have no condition to access the web with a browser, I cannot get web error information, I cannot locate the bug, what methods can I use to debugï¼Ÿ
It can be confirmed that the master and slave nodes have established a connection, because the slave's / tmp / nni has a corresponding Experiment directory, but the use case is not running, so the / tmp / nni / Experiment is empty.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Chen-Hongji&gt;@Chen-Hongji&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , there is a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/docs/en_US/Tutorial/HowToDebug.md&gt;doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to introduce debug method in NNI.
You could also use  command to get the stderr information from restserver, and use  command to get the logPath of trial jobs. In the logPath, you could get the error information for every trial job. You could find also  and  file in  folder, these two files contains more log information.
