ImportError: No module named freeze
I see there is no dependency for freeze.
And it gives the same error even I installed the freeze package.

		The &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.org/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack&gt;CI&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can import tensorpack, so it's not likely to be a problem of the code.
Do you happen to have a file called freeze.pyc somewhere? (e.g. in tensorpack/dataflow/).

		I see why.
Because I have installed the dataset package (a database interface package) before and there is a naming conflict.

		I see. I'll have to write it differently to avoid importing some external packages by mistake. Thanks for finding it out.
