	<summary>summary.add_activation_summary not working?</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/blob/master/examples/mnist-convnet.py&gt;mnist-convnet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 example, if I want to use summary.add_activation_summary, I simply add

at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/blob/master/examples/mnist-convnet.py#L96&gt;line96&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
but it raised an error saying that the input placeholders are empty.
Seems like summary.add_activation_summary should be implemented inside the inference_runner but is not?

		A bug was introduced lately. It always tries to evaluate the summary tensor in a separate sess.run call, which leads to error because the call may depend on feed_dict.
