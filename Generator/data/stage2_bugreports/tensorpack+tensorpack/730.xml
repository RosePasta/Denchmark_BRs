	<summary>Is the operation error of this function "DataParallelOfflinePredictor" caused by the revision?</summary>
	<description>
Hello, I have a error when I run the DataParallelOfflinePredictor function. After debugging, I am puzzled by the following statements if any(k in name for k in [':', '/', ' ']).
The statement
inputs_desc = [InputDesc(desc.type, desc.shape, tower_name + '/' + desc.name) for desc in config.inputs_desc]
in this function adds the "/", but the function  new(cls, type, shape, name) in the class of InputDesc  will report error when it detects "/" in the statement
if any(k in name for k in [':', '/', ' ']): raise ValueError("Invalid InputDesc name: '{}'".format(name)).
No example of calling this function was found in the latest version, an I don't know if my idea is right or not.
ps: The output is as follows:

Thank you.

		Interesting, that's indeed a problem. It's just DataParallelOfflinePredictor was never useful (it's not a good option for deployment) so I wasn't thinking about it.
