	<summary>UnboundLocalError: local variable 'raw_devices' referenced before assignment</summary>

 if ps_device == 'gpu': 



 raw_devices = ['/gpu:{}'.format(k) for k in self.towers] 



 devices = [LeastLoadedDeviceSetter(d, raw_devices) for d in raw_devices] 



 else:

I have reviewed this file, and by comparison I think raw_devices = ['/gpu:{}'.format(k) for k in self.towers] in line 351 should probably be defined before the if-else statement just like line 153-158 in the same file:

 devices = [tf.train.replica_device_setter( 



 worker_device=d, ps_device='/cpu:0', ps_tasks=1) for d in raw_devices]
