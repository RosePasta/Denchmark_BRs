Hi, the result in line 164 should be a dict and k in line 166 is not defined:



tensorpack/tensorpack/dataflow/common.py


        Lines 163 to 171
      in
      3ad0ed0






 elif isinstance(first_dp, dict): 



 result = [] 



 for key in first_dp.keys(): 



 data_list = [x[k] for x in data_holder] 



 if use_list: 



 result[key] = data_list 



 else: 



 result[key] = BatchData._batch_numpy(data_list) 



 return result
