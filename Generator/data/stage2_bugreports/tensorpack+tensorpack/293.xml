	<summary>Thread objects not properly initialized.</summary>
	<description>
Hi *,
the tensorpack.dataflow.prefetch.ThreadMapData defines the class WorkerThread which inherits from StroppableThread. Unfortunately, the constructor of WorkerThread does not call it's parent constructor.
Therefore, the constructor if threading.Tread will not be called before the run-method. This leads to an error.
Adding the following line tor the constructor of WorkerThread fixes the problem:
super(ThreadedMapData.WorkerThread, self).init()
