		But wait, what is the fix? I tried to import other callbacks from base.py and trigger.py instead of Triggerable, but so far the learning seems to be stuck at  Pre-filling staging area ...

		It's a long-standing issue when data depends on the model and may get dead-locked during initialization. Now you can run it with (&lt;=2) GPU (--gpu 0,1) but not more. I'll try to fix it.

		Btw, as mentioned in the README, running with many GPUs doesn't give you much benefits.
