	<summary>Running Cycle GAN error after epoch3</summary>
	<description>
Hi After epoch 3, There is a call to this fuunction
callbacks=[
ModelSaver(),
ScheduledHyperParamSetter(
'learning_rate',
[(100, 2e-4), (200, 0)], interp='linear'),
PeriodicTrigger(VisualizeTestSet(), every_k_epochs=3), #Value changed from 3 just for training
],vvvv
which throws error. I am not sure why this error comes, But I am guessing it is because of dataflow function in preprocess.py called  "PrefetchDataZMQ" Object has no attribute socket. I am not sure what this really means. I am attaching the error below.
W tensorflow/core/kernels/queue_base.cc:295] _0_QueueInput/input_queue: Skipping cancelled enqueue attempt with queue not closed

I have changed the visualiyation to after epoch 193, Hope that helps me atleast train the model ?

		Hi could you resolve visualization on test set after every 3 epochs.
Thanks,

		It should be fixed 14 days ago.
