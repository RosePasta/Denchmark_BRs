	<summary>Gray scale image feed error using 'ImageFromFile' dataflow</summary>
	<description>
Support for gray scale image is buggy as the output data has shape (w,h) instead of (w, h, 1)
Should add
if self.channel == 1:
im = im[:,:,None]
on line 39 of tensorpack/dataflow/image.py

		This was actually intended, but yes it might be a bit misleading. Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/commit/eb11e29c09fdec776682da978285d292b4e1a0c5&gt;eb11e29&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
