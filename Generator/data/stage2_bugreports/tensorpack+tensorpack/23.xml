	<summary>Super class init method not called for some image augmentors</summary>
	<description>
Several image augmentors (RandomCrop, RandomCropRandomShape ...) do not call super class init method, hence self.rng is not set until reset is explicitly called.
This makes usage in standalone mode infeasible with the error self.rng variable is not defined.
