	<summary>Error with only 1 gpu</summary>
	<description>
I got an error when I tried to train a model with only 1 gpu, not sure if the error goes away with 2 or not.
Here is the command line
python2.7 train-atari.py --env Breakout-v0 --gpu 0
Here is the error message.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "train-atari.py", line 258, in 
AsyncMultiGPUTrainer(config, predict_tower=predict_tower).train()
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class AsyncMultiGPUTrainer with abstract methods get_predict_func
Thanks for any help with this. It looks like a great package. I was able to get run_atari.py to run and got good output movies.

		Sorry I was doing some significant changes in the design and it looks like some part was broken.
I'm preparing a fix and meanwhile you can switch to some earlier commit e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/commit/efbf256e85eb95fece29866a0006b17ef8e9f8c1&gt;efbf256&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to play with it.

		It looks like the latest &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/commit/775f5c9ad96846e205366485284db00ebe111491&gt;775f5c9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is working. Please let me know if you encounter further error.

		Yes, it now runs thanks. By the way &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/commit/efbf256e85eb95fece29866a0006b17ef8e9f8c1&gt;efbf256&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 didn't work either but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/commit/efc74f2ddc101b1e9d465b1a0873774c6c2e0fac&gt;efc74f2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 did.
Thanks again.
