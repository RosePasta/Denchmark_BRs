	<summary>some image augmentations fail for single channel</summary>
	<description>
some image augmentations (eg flip, shift rotate) fail when image is single channel. we need to add:
       if img.ndim == 3 and ret.ndim == 2: ret = ret[:, :, np.newaxis]
to all image augmentations as it is implemented in resize (perhaps this could be added generically to base)
i also found a similar code in convert:
if self.keepdims: if len(transf.shape) is not len(img.shape): transf = transf[..., None]

		Right. This fix has to be added as long as opencv is involved.
