	<summary>Pre-filling staging area</summary>
	<description>
When I was training Mask RCNN with more than one gpus, the training process got stuck at "Pre-filling staging area...". When trained with one gpu, there is no such problem.  What could be the reason? Thank you.

		How did you install tensorpack? There was an old version which may have this problem.
If it's installed with pip, try: pip install -U git+https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack.git.

		Oh looks like latest master is actually broken. It's probably related to a recent commit a couple days ago.. I'll check that.

		Can I check out an old tensorpack to get the training started?

		Should be fixed now. It's always very hard to run tensorflow on multiple processes. The code worked before but is broken now probably because I'm using a newer tensorflow.
I'll just disable multiprocessing for now, since it shouldn't affect speed for fasterrcnn.

 , I have installed the latest tensorpack, with Tensorflow 1.9.0. I want to run the DoReFaNet on ImageNet using Tensorpack provided. has same issue. I have tried to change Tensorflow version, but still stuck at Prefilling staging... Can you provide some suggestions?
