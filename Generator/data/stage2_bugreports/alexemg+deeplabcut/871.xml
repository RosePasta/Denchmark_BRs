	<summary>No video file found when attempting to create video</summary>
	<description>
I'm using DLC/2.2b7 with the Linux Cent OS 7. I'm using the GUI and at the step of "create videos" I keeping the following error in the console, I attempted to run with both filtered and unfiltered data just to be sure this wasn't the issue.
Loading /data/aloimonos
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68077083/91188278-1e512d80-e6bf-11ea-9d52-5f72a80a757c.PNG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

cm/AD2_2019_07_15_tr2-0000-0000.avi and data.
No unfiltered data file found in /data/aloimonoscm for video AD2_2019_07_15_tr2-0000-0000 and scorer DLC_resnet50_skeleton_testAug18shuffle1_150000.
/data/aloimonoscm  already exists!
Starting to process video: /data/aloimonoscm/AD2_2019_07_15_tr2-0000-0000.avi
Loading /data/aloimonoscm/AD2_2019_07_15_tr2-0000-0000.avi and data.
No filtered data file found in /data/aloimonoscm for video AD2_2019_07_15_tr2-0000-0000 and scorer DLC_resnet50_skeleton_testAug18shuffle1_150000.
The files referred to exist in the path data/aloimonoscm. I've tried to analyze the files multiples times in case there was an issue during the analysis but this step appears to have worked correctly and the .h5 and .pickle files were created correctly. If anyone has any insight into what the issue might be that would be great.
Thanks
Chloe

		this has happened before on unsupported OS; &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jeylau&gt;@jeylau&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it's something about how the paths are encoded I believe.... not a real bug.
