	<summary>Labels are not created after using the GUI (fixed)</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm using windows 10 with anaconda env.  and the new version of DLC.

chrome

I'm trying the demo for my data.
The GUI worked and labeled the points, but in the next step: "check the labels" the folder that created- "labeled" is  empty.
what can I do to change that?
Thank you!

		This is an issue with the resulting file paths being invalid on Windows. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/117&gt;#117&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for a fix.

		*from Slack group: * when I run deeplabcut.check_labels(), the function creates a folder with the name videoname_labelled, and it creates the images with the overlaid labels, but it then saves these images in the folder videoname instead of videoname_labelled, thus overwriting the original frames.
FIXED with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/117&gt;#117&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I'm sorry, I didn't understand the suggestion for solving the problem in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/117&gt;#117&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Can you be more specific about the steps?

		You can just download the latest code here and it is fixed! :) Itâ€™s not updated in the pip package yet, but will be later today.
