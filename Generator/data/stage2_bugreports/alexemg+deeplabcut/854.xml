	<summary>small shifting issue with labeling frames</summary>
	<description>
Hi all,
I have noticed for a time now that there is a very small (but yet annoying) shifting problem with the GUI labeling option.
Each time I'm labeling some frames, if I go back to some previous frames which I already labeled I see that some of the placements had changed. This is a very small shifting, but yet important for the accuracy of the training.
(my operating system and dlc version:) Windows 10, Anaconda 3 Env (GPU) &amp; DeepLabCut 2.2b6
Attached are some screenshots of the same labeled frame with the noticeable shifting:

		can you upgrade to the current repo, i.e. run pip install git+https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git and see if this persists? Indeed that is an issue!
can you also tell me the versions of pandas and matplotlib you are using?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import matplotlib
matplotlib.__version__

import pandas
pandas.__version__
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		(NOTE: this was introduced only in 2.2beta; before this bug didn't exist and is not fixed).

, that's incorrect. I can reproduce it too with 2.1.8.2; and the PR now addresses both single and multi-animal labeling.

		I am having this issue on Centos with v2.1.8.2. We are not having this problem with .mp4 video files but are with .wmv files after extraction.

		Would you mind sharing a short GIF of you triggering that label shift? That'd be super helpful :)
