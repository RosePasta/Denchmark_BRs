	<description>
We need to add an upgrade task to the Makefile so we do not leave the target machine in a state with 2 different versions of OpenCV installed.

		Now that the  is stabilized, perhaps we can implement this now. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/maruel&gt;@maruel&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 what do you think?

		upgrade: download build sudo_install clean verify
but the trick would be to query the current version and not upgrade if not necessary. In practice, it can be
OPENCV_VERSION=3.5.8 make install

		The problem is that at least on Ubuntu, you need to run sudo make uninstall or perform the equivalent tasks, which in the case of OpenCV seems to mostly be removing the /usr/local/lib/libopencv_* lib files and /usr/local/include/opencv* header files, at the very least.

		change the "install" dependency order to uninstall before installing? Or make sudo_install to always force reinstall?

		Ideally we would need to uninstall the previous version, but the files to do so will have been removed by "clean" task.

		A manual make uninstall task also will need to remove the pkg-config file opencv.pc which on my Ubuntu installation is located at /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\opencv.pc.

		I think this has been addressed some time ago, so closing.
