	<summary>Compile error on Raspberry Pi OS 32bit</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pi@raspberrypi:~/go/src/gocv.io/x/gocv $ go run ./cmd/version/main.go 
# gocv.io/x/gocv
./core.go:2009:16: type [1073741824]*_Ctype_char larger than address space
./core.go:2009:16: type [1073741824]*_Ctype_char too large
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The line goes like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tmpslice := (*[1 &lt;&lt; 30]*C.char)(unsafe.Pointer(strs.strs))[:length:length]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the fix is trivial,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;tmpslice := (*[1 &lt;&lt; 28]*C.char)(unsafe.Pointer(strs.strs))[:length:length]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As far as I can tell, it doesn't cause any problems, but I tested this in a limited capacity. Should I send a PR to address this?
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dlsniper&gt;@dlsniper&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you can probably even reduce to  in most cases. Yes, we'd appreciate a PR.

		For the PR, what would be the preferred solution? Just replace it with 1&lt;&lt;20 everywhere? Or something configurable? I did not have the time to study the code yet to be confident in a solution without some advice first. Thank you!

		Previous PRs have used 1 &lt;&lt; 27:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hybridgroup/gocv/issues/90&gt;#90&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think we can safely change that everywhere. The CI build will let us know if that is true, so low risk.

		I have tested 1 &lt;&lt; 27 on my pi 4 and it works, once they release the 64 bit of the raspberry pi os (or whatever it's called now) should be a moot point yeh?

Unless you are still using a 32bit bit OS because you don't need anything specific to the 64bit arch.

		This was released with v0.26.0 so now closing. Thank you everyone!
