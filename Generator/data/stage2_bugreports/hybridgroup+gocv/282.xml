	<summary>'make install' endless loop on CentOS 7</summary>
	<description>
On CentOS 7 x64, make install goes into an endless loop.
It looks like the Makefile is expecting a (probably newer) version of wget than provided with CentOS:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;wget: unrecognized option '--show-progress'
Usage: wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

Try `wget --help' for more options.
unzip:  cannot find or open opencv.zip, opencv.zip.zip or opencv.zip.ZIP.
wget: unrecognized option '--show-progress'
Usage: wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

Try `wget --help' for more options.
unzip:  cannot find or open opencv_contrib.zip, opencv_contrib.zip.zip or opencv_contrib.zip.ZIP.
rm: cannot remove â€˜opencv.zipâ€™: No such file or directory
rm: cannot remove â€˜opencv_contrib.zipâ€™: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Removing the --show-progress option from the wget line seems to work, although the script bombs out later anyway with -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!.  (going to look into that shortly)
As a general thought for troubleshooting, it'd probably be useful to have the Makefile detect when something goes wrong so it can skip the automatic rm -rf of the temp directory it builds OpenCV in. ðŸ˜‰
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Your Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Operating System and version:

CentOS 7 x64.  Specifically CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (Core).


OpenCV version used:

3.4.2


How did you install OpenCV?

go get -u -d gocv.io/x/gocv


GoCV version used:

3.4.2 is being attempted


Go version:

1.11


Did you run the env.sh or env.cmd script before trying to go run or go build?

No, there's no mention of them in the initial docs.  Should there be?
