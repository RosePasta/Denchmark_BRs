		I found something else too, if i add more image files to the annotated directory the when i open the project again the boxes mess up, and to fix it i have to rename with an alphabet that comes after the last annotated filenames first character..very strange but  have proven this through tests.
for example: if have images in a folder that starts with box1, box2, box3 ... then if i add anything that starts with A then t mess up, it has to be a char after character 'B'.
