	<summary>Error running VoTT Release V1.5.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS</summary>
	<description>
I am on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS. I downloaded the V1.5.0 release for Linux, extracted the files, and tried to run the VoTT executable.
When I ran the executable I got:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./VoTT: error while loading shared libraries: libgconf-2.so.4: 
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

To fix this problem I ran:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sudo apt-get install -y libgconf-2-4
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As this is an electron app, I suggest looking at this issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1518&gt;electron/electron#1518&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After this, I was able to launch the VoTT executable, but I still got Gtk-Message: 15:33:42.832: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module" (though this did not prevent me from using the VoTT app)

		Strange does it work if you install and run from npm?

		I also tried to also run with npm, but got the same error messages.

		Closing, since using the running the latest release 1.6.1 vott_linux.snap solves this issue.

		I'm using the preview 3 release of 2.0 and I still get the warning
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"
even though this it is installed. I ran  following this thread: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/gtk-message-failed-to-load-module-canberra-gtk-module-936168/&gt;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/gtk-message-failed-to-load-module-canberra-gtk-module-936168/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and the warning message is the same
