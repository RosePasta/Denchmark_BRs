	<summary>V2 Preview-1 OSX "Refresh Application" doesn't work AB#17058</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
In version 2.0.0-preview1 OSX, when clicking on the "Refresh Application" button in settings the app just goes to a blank white screen
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Open VoTT (I have no connections created and no local projects, it was my first time installing VoTT)
Click on the settings gear in the lower left corner
Click the "Refresh Application" button on the right hand side

Expected behavior
Unclear, but I was anticipating going back to the home screen or something with no projects there

Additional context
I don't have any projects setup yet, so this perhaps might not happen if projects are setup.

 - This is a bug.  The application should refresh the current window.
