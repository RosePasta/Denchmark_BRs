	<summary>Output JSON should contain file names</summary>
	<description>
If we load a directory of images into VoTT, proceed with tagging, and save, the output JSON is a dictionary with zero-indexed keys (stored as strings), that maps to a list of tags per frame.
We're currently building tooling around VoTT, and expect to preserve file names somewhere within the output JSON, hoping to avoid keeping a map of frame indexes to file names on the tagger's machine.

		Current json output for frames:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"frames": {

        "0": [...],

        "1": [...],

        "2": [...],

        "3": [...],

        "4": [...]
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

desired output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"frames": {

        "st1020.png": [...],

        "st1021.png": [...],

        "st1022.png": [...],

        "st1023.png": [...],

        "st1024.png": [...]

    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This has been addressed in the dev branch, working on creating a release for master

 any updates on when the release will occur?
Also, if I've found a bug on the current 'dev' branch, should I open an issue here? Basically the 'visitedFrames' has inconsistent naming, the first element is the filename only, subsequent entries have the full filepath.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"visitedFrames": [
        "1012.png",
        "/Users/mtarng/Downloads/small-image-set/1210.png",
        "/Users/mtarng/Downloads/small-image-set/1238.png",
        "/Users/mtarng/Downloads/small-image-set/1576.png",
        "/Users/mtarng/Downloads/small-image-set/1748.png",
        "/Users/mtarng/Downloads/small-image-set/1760.png",
        "/Users/mtarng/Downloads/small-image-set/1774.png"
    ]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 I took a look at the source, and found where the isue that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mtarng&gt;@mtarng&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is describing above is originating:
Line 463 initializes the visitedFrames set with the first image. At this point, videotagging.imagelist only contains file names:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;visitedFrames = new Set([videotagging.imagelist[0]])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, line 509 appends the path with the file names and assigns it to videotagging.imagelist, thereby mutating it, and causing the full paths to be added everywhere:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;videotagging.imagelist = videotagging.imagelist.map((filepath) =&gt; {return path.join(pathName,filepath)});
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tried to remove line 509 entirely, but it look like it causes some issues when loading the images in vott

 Sorry for the late reply, I just realized that this is actually an issue with windows vs unix. Will push a fix soon
