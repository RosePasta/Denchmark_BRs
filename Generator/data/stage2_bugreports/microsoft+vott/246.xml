	<summary>Can't create bounding box by clicking in existing box</summary>
	<description>
If you have one box that is the entire head of a person, but also want to add a new box that is an eye, you just keep selecting the existing box instead of creating a new one.
It would be great to be able to start a bounding box inside of an existing box.  I could see the functionality of holding shift and being able to have a new box drawn starting where you click inside an existing box instead of it only selecting the existing box as it does now.
