		Hello,
the number keys are the one I would really use, in addition, I just tested the other presented in the README:


Working: ctrl+O, ctrl+I, ctrl+S, ctrl+E,ctrl+space, ctrl+D ; D, ctrl+C, ctrl+X, ctrl+V, dir(next/previous image)


Not working:



ctrl+T (Console said: Cannot read property 'stopTracking' of undefined),
ctrl+N, no effect
shift+Del, no effect but may be just for video
ctrl+H,  no effect
number keys, no effect
ctrl+dir (region manipulation); ctrl+alt+dir; wctrl+shift+dir


Unsure, not applicable: ctrl+A, space

I may have forgotten one or two.

		Hello,
I gave it another try but this time, I downloaded the linux AppImage (V 1.7.2) and it worked as intended. Previously, I took a  zip file which looked like V 1.5.0 (VoTT-linux-x64.zip; with inside a version file saying 1.8.7).
