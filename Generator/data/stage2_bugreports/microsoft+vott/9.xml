		This is a bi-produt of the video control since it was unclear that the "frame rate" option was the video frame rate and not the since the frame rate of the video and not the rate of frames to extract per a second of video. In any case the skip and video playback will cause misalignment since their is no guarantee that the video framerate will be the same as playback rate of the html video component. &lt;denchmark-link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28420724/how-to-determine-the-intended-frame-rate-on-an-html-video-element&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28420724/how-to-determine-the-intended-frame-rate-on-an-html-video-element&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

For now the solution is to disable seek and playback, the long term and more elegant solution will to use a image carousel, and break the video up into images before processing.
