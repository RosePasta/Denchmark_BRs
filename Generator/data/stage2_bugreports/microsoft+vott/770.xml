	<summary>Export to CustomVision service works only for Classification</summary>
	<description>
I was not able to export to CustomVision for Detection - it ends up in classification regardless of project type selection

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/michalmar&gt;@michalmar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  Right now the  dropdown contains domains for both classification projects and object detection projects.  The 2nd half of list starting at  are object classification domains.  Please try selecting one of these in combination with  project type and it should work as expected.
We're working on cleaning this up so it is more clear.

		thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wbreza&gt;@wbreza&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! I just missed that there are two  domains while the first leads to Classification and the second to Detection. It is working now!
