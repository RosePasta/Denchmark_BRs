	<summary>Export to Custom Vision doesn't work if you already have a maximum number of projects</summary>
	<description>
Hi!
At Paris ML OpenHack I tried to demo how you can build custom object detection service using Custom Vision and VOTT. I found that if you have maximum number of projects in your customvision.ai account, VOTT just doesn't export images with no user-friendly errors as it can't create a new project to export images.
It would be great to add at least basic user-friendly error handling for export for Custom Vision Service.
Thanks,
Stas
