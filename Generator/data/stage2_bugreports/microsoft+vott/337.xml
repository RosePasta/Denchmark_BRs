  in the master branch I can no longer remove a selected tag with with the delete key. I can also no longer drag or resize bounding boxes or cycle through boxes with the tab key.

		Also holding the ctrl key leaves three bounding boxes

		I will check today. Seems like I broke something with shortcuts management.
Also maybe we should consider adding hot keys related tests.

 Sorry, I can't reproduce any of that on my build. Can you check it with my latest PR? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT/pull/338&gt;#338&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

What about other shortcuts? E.g. R and T keys to switch selection mode, L to lock regions?

		Hotkeys work for me too with current master.
