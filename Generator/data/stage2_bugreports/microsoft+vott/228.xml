	<summary>Labels are positioned in the wrong location after Active Learning using FasterRcnn</summary>
	<description>
Hi everyone,
I am training a model defining the dimension size 300x300 and using pictures size 224x171. I load the pictures and run the active learning option. The active learning works fine, but the labels are positioned in the wrong location. The x axis is fine, but the y axis is offset to a wrong location. I think that there is a problem calculating the borders.
I would appreciate any help!
