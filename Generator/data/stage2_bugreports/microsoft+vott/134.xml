	<summary>Enhancement request:  dynamic directory contents w/o losing tagging data correlation</summary>
	<description>
Hi -
The tool works great on JPG directories and AVIs, but when I use JPGs, I have discovered I have to be careful about keeping the contents of the directory unchanged during tagging sessions, otherwise I mess up the tagging information in the JSON file.  I found this out when I copied some additional JPGs into a directory after starting a tagging session.  The JSON file did not like this, and tags and images no longer correlated after a while.  I suspect the same is true for deleting images in a folder after a tagging session is started.
Of course the brute force way here is to delete the JSON file and start the tagging session over.  But if a user has tagged hundreds or even thousands of images, this is not work they would want to repeat.
Anyway, just an idea to improve an already excellent tool.  Thanks!
Rob

		Hey this is a good feedback its caused by the way node reads in and indexes files by name. I will think of a way to address in the mean time i suggest writing a small script that adds a prefix to your new images to maintain order. Another solution would be two tag the new images in a sub directory and export to the same output folder.

		That is an okay workaround - I am using that currently to merge training sets.  I do have to manually merge train.txt and test.txt files though.
