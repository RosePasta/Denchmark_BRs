	<summary>Can't really set n_independant or n_shared to zero</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
What is the current behavior?
It's possible without error to train with n_independent=0 and n_shared=0 and looking at the code it seems that zero is actually 1, so minimal value is 1 and this should not be the case.
If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.
Expected behavior
Well I guess 0 and 0 should throw a clear error, but 0 should mean 0.

		After looking at the code, I think the problem is especially on n_independent, that should accept value &gt;=1
