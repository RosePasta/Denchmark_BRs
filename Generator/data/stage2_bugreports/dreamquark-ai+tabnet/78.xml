	<summary>Bug with 1 shared layer and 2 independent layers</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
There is a problem with the way we deal with layers indexing that deals to a bug.
What is the current behavior?
You'll get an error if trying to set n_shared to 1 and n_independent to 2 for example.
Expected behavior
We should be able to put any value without error.
A fairly simple fix should be done
