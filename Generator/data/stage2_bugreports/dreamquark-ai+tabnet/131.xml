Describe the bug
new() received an invalid combination of arguments - got (list, int), but expected one of:

(*, torch.device device)
didn't match because some of the arguments have invalid types: (!list!, !int!)
(torch.Storage storage)
(Tensor other)
(tuple of ints size, *, torch.device device)
(object data, *, torch.device device)
