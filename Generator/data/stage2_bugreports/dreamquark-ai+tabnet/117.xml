	<summary>Example Regression not working in Google Colab</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I tried to run on gpu and then on cpu and with different embedding sizes.
Still I get a dimension error.
Here is the link to the notebook:

		Ok meanwhile I just used the preprocessing and the parameters of the classifier notebook which worked. Seems like there is an issue with preprocessing proabably due to pandas 1.
And also the cat_emb_dim is now set to 1

		hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/franz101&gt;@franz101&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you show the error you to, if it's about embedding size with regression we already fixed the bug, but it has not been release yet, so you can use the code from develop branch or wait for the release that should come this week.

Sure no problem.
I fixed the issues by commenting them out.
First issue was due indexing problems in my dataset (the fillna with mean part)
Second issue was due to the embedding dimensions.
Third issue was due to a reshaping in the Train test data (.reshape(-1, 1))
Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eduardocarvp&gt;@eduardocarvp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The notebook is now working. Btw is there a way of installing the latest dev version with pip install git://.... ?

 you may try to install the develop branch doing this :
pip install  "git+https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet.git@develop#egg=pytorch_tabnet" --upgrade
