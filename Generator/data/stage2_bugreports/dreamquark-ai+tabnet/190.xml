		Hello this has already been pointed here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet/issues/163&gt;#163&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It has been solved already in develop branch, you have 3 options:

switch to develop
switch to python 3.7
wait for next release

Feel free to reopen and give more information if you think that this is not related.
