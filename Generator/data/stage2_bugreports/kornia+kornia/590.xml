	<summary>A bug in core/conversions which makes the module fail in higher version of PyTorch</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There is a function called "rotation_matrix_to_quaternion",
in line 302 ~ line 304, there is code like following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    mask_c1 = mask_d2 * (1 - mask_d0_d1)
    mask_c2 = (1 - mask_d2) * mask_d0_nd1
    mask_c3 = (1 - mask_d2) * (1 - mask_d0_nd1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The "1 - boolean tensor " operation will cause PyTorch to raise an error:
Subtraction, the - operator, with a bool tensor is not supported. If you are trying to invert a mask, use the ~ or logical_not() operator instead.
from my understanding, the "1 -  boolean tensor" is doing the same thing as logical not. So I replaced that piece of code as:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    mask_c1 = mask_d2 * torch.logical_not( mask_d0_d1)
    mask_c2 = torch.logical_not( mask_d2) * mask_d0_nd1
    mask_c3 = torch.logical_not( mask_d2) * torch.logical_not( mask_d0_nd1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And it worked.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 could you send a PR with this fix ? Besides, take into account that we have known issues for this set of conversion functions
