	<summary>[BUG] test_image crashes with PyTorch 1.0.1</summary>
	<description>
Noticed that there's either a bug somewhere in test_image.py or in last PyTorch release 1.0.1.
The crash happens when updating to pytorch-cpu==1.0.1 in TravisCI.
UPDATE (11/02/2019):
Confirmed that after installing pytorch-cpu==1.0.1 through the script setup_travis_env.sh there is a crash only in TravisCI. Tried to reproduce in local and seems to work as expected. Poltergeist in new stable release v1.0.1?
Link to the PR (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kornia/kornia/pull/72&gt;#72&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) and build:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/arraiyopensource/torchgeometry/jobs/176774886&gt;https://travis-ci.com/arraiyopensource/torchgeometry/jobs/176774886&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
How to reproduce the issue:
git clone https://github.com/arraiyopensource/torchgeometry
cd torchgeometry
./setup_travis_env.sh
source path.bash.inc
pytest test
You should get green lights, TravisCI don't.

		is there a way you can get a stack-trace.
You can probably modify your script to make it run under gdb and print a stack-trace to the console.

 thanks for your time. It turns out that the issue has been solved by itself restarting again the jobs (already tried that before though). I guess they did some update in TravisCI since I didn't touch my code and I guess you didn't update the pytorch wheels for v1.0.1 right ?
