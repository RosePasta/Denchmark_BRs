	<summary>[DOCS] crop_and_resize interface changed</summary>
	<description>
crop_and_resize boxes format changed,  used to be (0.1.4):
"The tensor must have the shape of Bx4x2, where each box is defined in the following order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right. The coordinates order must be in y, x respectively"
Now (0.2.0):
"The tensor must have the shape of Bx4x2, where each box is defined in the following (clockwise) order: top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left. The coordinates must be in the x, y order."
This change destroys backward compatibility.  Perhaps should be noted in release notes.
Thanks
