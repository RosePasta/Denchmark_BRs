	<summary>[BUG] incorrect batch quaternion conversion</summary>
	<description>
I run the following lines of code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import torch
import kornia

print(f'torch: {torch.__version__}')
print(f'kornia: {kornia.__version__}')

batch_rotation = torch.empty(10, 3, 3)
for rotation in batch_rotation:
    torch.nn.init.orthogonal_(rotation)
    
batch_quat = kornia.geometry.conversions.rotation_matrix_to_quaternion(batch_rotation)
new_batch_rotation = kornia.geometry.conversions.quaternion_to_rotation_matrix(batch_quat)

for rotation, new_rotation in zip(batch_rotation, new_batch_rotation):
    print(torch.allclose(rotation, new_rotation))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and obtain inconsistent results:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;torch: 1.2.0
kornia: 0.1.4.post2
False
True
True
False
True
False
False
True
False
False
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Overall, the conversion between quaternions and rotation matrices seems to be incorrect.

 this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kornia/kornia/issues/317&gt;#317&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kornia/kornia/pull/354&gt;#354&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 downgrades to a previous version that's supposed to work. I will investigate this today to avoid going back to previous implementations.
