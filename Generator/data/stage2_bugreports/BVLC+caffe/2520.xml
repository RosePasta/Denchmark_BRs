	<summary>Non-meaningful errors when parsing window files</summary>
	<description>
After hours of debugging I found why my window file (used for fine tuning) produces the following not very enlightening error:
I0527 15:10:47.169782  4144 window_data_layer.cpp:376] output data size: 64,0,227,227
I0527 15:10:47.169786  4144 window_data_layer.cpp:388] Loading mean file from../../data/ilsvrc12/imagenet_mean.binaryproto

It turns out that whitespaces in file names (in this case in the Barcelona dataset) are not supported. I did not find any workaround, other than to rename the files (tried using "" and escaping the whitespace).
Furthermore it turns out that if one image is missing in the window file (where missing means that after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/423&gt;#423&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 comes &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/425&gt;#425&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), it just crashes after reading in the network definition without any error.
I think especially the first error is a serious issue that should need to be fixed (at least with proper error messages).
Cheers

		The WindowData layer is essentially deprecated and only kept for archival purposes for the sake of the original R-CNN. It should be declared deprecated in the documentation as it is not going to be further maintained.
