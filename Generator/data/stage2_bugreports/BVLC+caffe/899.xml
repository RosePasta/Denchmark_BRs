	<summary>Python Web Demo Example Broken in Latest Release</summary>
	<description>
The web demo has the following defects:

The parameter mean_file should be mean in the classifier initialization in app.py
The mean is treated as a string when it should be an array in pycaffe.py (should add mean = np.load(mean) above the line if mode == 'elementwise':
Even after making the code run, the actual result doesn't work, that is, no matter the query image, the result is classified as a "window screen."  (I believe the problem lies in the python/caffe code)

		Right, the web demo needs to be updated to the new Python interface input preprocessing adopted in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/816&gt;#816&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The answer to (3) is that the raw_scale needs to be set to 255 as well as the mean fixes you suggested in (1) and (2).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sergeyk&gt;@sergeyk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 could you fix this if you have a chance?

		This bug is still present in the latest master code. Had to add as suggested:

 I think this is in your purview, as you seem to have merged it
to master through a commit: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/910&gt;#910&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		All I did was take your fix and release it to master. Taking another look I think the fix is actually correct, and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/marutiagarwal&gt;@marutiagarwal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 just needs to call  with the array instead of a file path. False alarm.
