	<summary>Python3: net.params is an empty dictionary</summary>
	<description>
Hi!
After updating to the latest github master ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/commit/be163be0ea5befada208dbf0db29e6fa5811dc86&gt;be163be&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) under Python 3.5.1 (using boost 1.59, protobuf 3.0.0.alpha and lmdb 0.9.17). The Python wrapper doesn't seem to work correctly anymore. Concretely,  returns an empty dictionary:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import caffe
net = caffe.Net("../bvlc_alexnet/deploy.prototxt",
                "../bvlc_alexnet/bvlc_alexnet.caffemodel",
                caffe.TEST)
print(net.params.keys())
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; odict_keys([])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Curiously, I can access net.blobs just fine:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print(net.blobs.keys())
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; odict_keys(['data', 'conv1', 'norm1', 'pool1', 'conv2', 'norm2', 'pool2', 'conv3', 'conv4', 'conv5', 'pool5', 'fc6', 'fc7', 'fc8', 'prob'])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This bug was not present in our previous installation (I don't have the exact commit number, but it was cloned ~3 months ago). A colleague of mine tried the same caffe-version under Python 2, and there everything still seems to work as expected. Any help would be appreciated.

		The error has disappeared after a make clean and a recompilation, so I'm assuming the error was me not doing a clean recompile.

		I encountered same error in python2, and solved it by make clean. Thank you.
