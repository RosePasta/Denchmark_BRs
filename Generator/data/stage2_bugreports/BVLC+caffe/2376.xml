	<summary>bad escape in draw.py</summary>
	<description>
Per &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29055715/drawing-network-in-caffe-causes-pydot-to-throw-end-of-line-errors&gt;this Stack Overflow thread&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there is probably an error in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/draw.py#L58&gt;line 58 of draw.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. On my system, replacing  with , as that thread suggests, fixed the crash. I'm not sure if this is a configuration problem or indeed a bug.
My config is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ uname -r
3.18.11-gentoo
$ python --version
Python 2.7.9
$ eix graphviz | grep -i installed
     Installed versions:  2.26.3-r4^t(02:54:36 21/04/15)(cairo gtk nls python -doc -examples -java -lasi -perl -ruby -static-libs -tcl ELIBC="-FreeBSD")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Thanks for the report; I've update the title to be more specific. At a glance, the fix appears to be correct; you're welcome to PR it.

		I don't think I will PR it, since this requires some additional investigation (on some systems everything works without the fix), and I don't currently have time for that. Maybe the next person who comes across this problem will examine why this happens.
