	<summary>Solver `CheckType()` is faulty and direct instantiation fails</summary>
	<description>
When specify the solver type in the solver.prototxt, CheckType failed.

 is wrong &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shelhamer&gt;@shelhamer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

virtual function type() shouldn't be called in constructors.

 Thanks for catching this! I thought the tests would have caught this mistake regarding virtuals but apparently not.  continues to work but direct instantiation by  for instance does not.
I'll try to remedy this as soon as possible. For now I've reverted the commit by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/commit/b644a87c842702de8291c97fa0e418797092fe41&gt;b644a87&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

 we can't rely on this for parallel solvers.
