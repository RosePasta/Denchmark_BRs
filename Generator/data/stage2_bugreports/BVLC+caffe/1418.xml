	<summary>caffe.io.resize_image generates nan if passed a constant image</summary>
	<description>
If you pass an image that's all the same value to caffe.io.resize_image(), you get nan's.  It's due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/c18d22eb92488f02c0256a3fe4ac20a8ad827596/python/caffe/io.py#L48&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which divides by the difference between the min and max.  This is needed because skimage resize clips values outside the range [0,1]. A fix would involve just checking whether min and max are too close.
