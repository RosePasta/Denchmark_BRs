	<summary>Bug: draw_net utility fails when prototxt has no "name" attribute</summary>
	<description>
Consider the following simple prototxt

layer {
name: "data"
type: "DummyData"
top: "X"
top: "y"
dummy_data_param: {
shape: {dim:50 dim:1024 }
shape: {dim:50}
}
}
layer {
name: "fc"
type: "InnerProduct"
bottom: "X"
top: "fc"
inner_product_param {
num_output: 100
}
}
layer {
name: "relu"
type: "ReLU"
bottom: "fc"
top: "fc" # in place
}

if I try to "draw" it
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;~$ python $CAFFE_ROOT/python/draw_net.py dummy.prototxt dummy.png
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I get the following error:

Drawing net to output.png
Warning: /tmp/tmpOMoJNS: syntax error in line 1 near '{'

However, adding

name: "dummy net"

To the prototxt, solves this issue.
Why is this an issue?
I noticed that when I use caffe.NetSpec() to create models' prototxt the "name" attribute is omitted.
So please, it would be nice if

draw_net.py will not fail if "name" is missing
caffe.NetSpec() will have a "name" attribute in the resulting to_proto() output.

Thanks!

		Yeah that bothers me too.

  I spent ages to track this &amp;^%$ down... it's so good to know I am not alone here...

		For me

name: "dummy net"

didn't work. I had to ensure that name didn't have a space in it:

name: "dummynet"
