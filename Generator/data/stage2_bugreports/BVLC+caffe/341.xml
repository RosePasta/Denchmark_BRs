	<summary>WriteProtoToTextFile writes nothing when the target file does not exist</summary>
	<description>
I found that  does not write anything if  does not indicate an existing file, due to use of open(2) with  at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/util/io.cpp#L46&gt;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/util/io.cpp#L46&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I think this behavior is unintuitive (and also inconsistent with its binary version). Is it intended? If not, I want to fix it.
