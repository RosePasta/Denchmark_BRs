	<summary>Python can't set the device / phase for net initialization</summary>
	<description>
cuDNN handles and such are acquired at net initialization when the cuDNN layers that require these resources are constructed. Since the Python interface only exposes set_device() as a method of Net instead of a module function, it is too late to actually set the device for cuDNN computation once the net is made. All cuDNN computation from Python is run on GPU 0 for this reason, and attempts to set other devices will fail with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;status == CUDNN_STATUS_SUCCESS (8 vs. 0)  CUDNN_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

due to the disagreement between initialization and execution.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/longjon&gt;@longjon&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has the workaround for now: use the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES instead of using set_device.
The simplest fix is to expose set_device() and set_phase from the caffe module itself as functions. This is only a bandaid and changes the interface.
Of course The Right Idea is to make Net responsible for device and phase, set them at initialization, and never switch &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/1500&gt;#1500&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
... but that involves a few details.

		How do I make this modification for DIGITS? I am getting that same error there after the first epoch.

, can you open a new issue against DIGITS? I bet your issue is unrelated to this one.
