	<summary>MemoryDataLayer performs transformations inconsistently</summary>
	<description>
in MemoryDataLayer
top[0]-&gt;Reshape(batch_size_, channels_, height_, width_);
top[1]-&gt;Reshape(batch_size_, 1, 1, 1);
added_data_.Reshape(batch_size_, channels_, height_, width_);
added_label_.Reshape(batch_size_, 1, 1, 1);
in ImageDataLayer
if (crop_size &gt; 0) {
top[0]-&gt;Reshape(batch_size, channels, crop_size, crop_size);
this-&gt;prefetch_data_.Reshape(batch_size, channels, crop_size, crop_size);
this-&gt;transformed_data_.Reshape(1, channels, crop_size, crop_size);
} else {
top[0]-&gt;Reshape(batch_size, channels, height, width);
this-&gt;prefetch_data_.Reshape(batch_size, channels, height, width);
this-&gt;transformed_data_.Reshape(1, channels, height, width);
}
When crop is used in MemoryDataLayer the result is wrong

		Thanks for the report; there is a known issue that MemoryDataLayer only sometimes performs transformations, which I'll now generalize this issue to.

		Actually, this is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/1784&gt;#1784&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so continue any discussion there.
