	<summary>normalizing using LRN layer</summary>
	<description>
I wish to normalize across channels (I have 30 channels). To do so (unless I misunderstand) I can use the LRN layer with norm_region=ACROSS_CHANNEL and local_size = 61. The local_size = 2*num_of_channels+1 with zero padding should ensure the normalisation factor is constant across channels.
If I do this in CPU, it works fine. If I run it in GPU when norm_region is larger then the number of channels I get NAN's.
Any ideas?
Thanks

		Thanks for the report. It's looking like this might be a bug that occurs when local_size is larger than the number of channels.

 while (head &lt; size) { 





In the case where size &gt; channels I believe this loop is causing us to index out of bounds. This is something that shouldn't be too hard to fix, although there's a release upcoming so this might have to wait until after that release goes through.
