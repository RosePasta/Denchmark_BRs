	<summary>ImageData requires file paths with no spaces</summary>
	<description>
I'm not really sure if this is a bug or a feature request, but it would be nice if the file paths passed into the ImageData layer could have spaces in them and respected the shell '\ ' escape sequences.
Here's the relevant line:



caffe/src/caffe/layers/image_data_layer.cpp


         Line 40
      in
      f998127






 while (infile &gt;&gt; filename &gt;&gt; label) { 





If I have some free time I'll make a PR with the changes.
