	<summary>`pooling_layer.cu` incorrect computation of index</summary>
	<description>
Code &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/pooling_layer.cu#L31&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
During every loop iteration, the amount bottom_data changes differ.

		No, the code is correct -- each step of the unrolled loop is computing its index once (bottom_data is the same for each so the needed offset is calculated and added).

		See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/2493&gt;#2493&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the fix -- while this bug is currently hidden since all the loops only execute once this deserves fixing. Thanks for the report &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hotpxl&gt;@hotpxl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
