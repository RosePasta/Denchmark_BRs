		Segfaults shouldn't happen, could be an upstream issue though.
Does this happen every time? (Can you reproduce it?) Do any other tests fail? What's your distro/hardware?

		I realized that this does not seem to be caffe error, there seems to be some conflict between the nvidia driver and the cuda, not sure what is, I'll reinstall caffe and nvidia drivers to see the result. I report later.
Thanks Longjon
