	<summary>[bug report] convert_imageset with -g option to convert images data to  lmdb data</summary>
	<description>
I did not find the bug report page, so I report it here. If anyone know the bug report page, please kindly tell me and I will move this report there.
I use convert_iamgeset to convert images data to lmdb format data with-g flag and failed , here is the output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;~] time ~/ocr/caffe-dev/build/tools/convert_imageset -g ./ test.list test.lmdb 1 lmdb 16 80
F0804 11:08:30.133080  5572 convert_imageset.cpp:112] Check failed: mdb_env_open(mdb_env, argv[3], 0, 0664) == 0 (20 vs. 0) mdb_env_open failed

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If drop the-g option, everything goes well.

 as the contributor of the grayscale flag to the tools, have you had any trouble with grayscale inputs and lmdb storage?

		I haven't had a problem because I haven't pulled in a while, but I believe I can see the issue. While the current version of the dev branch has the mdb_env_open call on lines 113-114, rather than 112, as shown in the stack trace, it looks like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mavenlin&gt;@mavenlin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 forgot to use arg_offset in the argv indexing. The argument should be argv[arg_offset+3].

		Perhaps so. I'm not opposed but I don't have time now to do it myself.
If additional flags/options get added to the program, then definitely so.
