	<summary>Bug in newly added multi-gpu code</summary>
	<description>
Trying out simple networks with multi-gpu segfaults because they don't have learnable parameters:
In parallel.c these lines are critical:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&amp;data_, size_ * sizeof(Dtype)));
[...]
CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&amp;diff_, size_ * sizeof(Dtype)));
[...]
CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&amp;parent_grads_, size_ * sizeof(Dtype)));
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If the net does not have learnable parameters, size_ will be 0 and cudaMalloc will return null pointers.
I currently work around this by adding +1 byte to the allocated size, but there should be a better fix.

		Right now, multi-gpu is only used for training, so maybe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/2903&gt;#2903&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 didn't expect one to do multi-gpu training without learnable parameters.
Anyway, this problem should be address soon.

More fundamentally, what does it mean to train without learnable parameters?

Indeed, it doesn't make sense to train without learnable parameters.

		It can make a lot of sense.
Say I want to debug my data layer for multi-gpu usage, and just write the outputs to a file with a python layer..
Anyway, a segfault should never happen just because the network architecture doesn't make sense.

		A simple workaround provided in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/2924&gt;#2924&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Debates can follow in new issues on whether allowing training without learnable parameter.
