	<summary>Hamming distance CPU test failure on 32-bit</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I am trying execute "make runtest" and met some problems.
The caffe is successfully compiled on Ubuntu14.04 with CPU only.
When executing the testcases, it got stuck on function : ReferenceHammingDistance(n, x, y)
[----------] 8 tests from CPUMathFunctionsTest/1, where TypeParam = double
[ RUN      ] CPUMathFunctionsTest/1.TestNothing
[       OK ] CPUMathFunctionsTest/1.TestNothing (62 ms)
[ RUN      ] CPUMathFunctionsTest/1.TestHammingDistance
src/caffe/test/test_math_functions.cpp:86: Failure
Value of: caffe_cpu_hamming_distance(n, x, y)
Actual: 712929
Expected: this-&gt;ReferenceHammingDistance(n, x, y)
Which is: 1413025
[  FAILED  ] CPUMathFunctionsTest/1.TestHammingDistance, where TypeParam = double (62 ms)
The test finally aborted due to this. I saw there was similar problem in some old thread but indication it was actually solved.

Can someone help?

		Can you reproduce this with the latest  in  mode? (See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Reporting-Bugs-and-Other-Issues&gt;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Reporting-Bugs-and-Other-Issues&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.)
(You should only need to run build/test/test_math_function.testbin.) What's your CPU architecture? Are you running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Ubuntu?

		I'm  using 32-bit version of Ubuntu installed in virtual machine. And yes I
have the same error with the latest master.
Thanks,

		Thanks. It looks there is a bug on line &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/util/math_functions.cpp#L367&gt;https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/src/caffe/util/math_functions.cpp#L367&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which should probably read  instead of .
By the way, this should have generated warnings (make warn); did it not?
We don't have CI for 32-bit platforms, so it's not too surprising to see issues like this.

		Affected by this, running on Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit. I can confirm the proposed solution by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/longjon&gt;@longjon&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 works.

		Closing as the relevant code has been removed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/3404&gt;#3404&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
