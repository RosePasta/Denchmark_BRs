	<summary>Error: Duplicate blobs produced by multiple sources.</summary>
	<description>
N.B. This is already fixed, but today  was briefly broken at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/commit/d339d242b43ec5bec9dceb657ee0d665d524b1eb&gt;d339d24&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It was fixed by reverting at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/commit/dda89784ee208061484f102bff7dde4a8616f3e9&gt;dda8978&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
In case you run into this error about "Duplicate blobs" simply pull the latest master and everything will be right.
Leaving this issue open for now as a public service announcement. To avoid issues in the future, we are adopting a dev branch for development, integration, and testing to protect master.

 What is going to happen to the PR done before there was the  branch?

		I'll perform the proper rituals.
(PRs can be merged to branches other than their requested target and I know the magic. This'll be a one-time fix. It might save a little effort to close PRs and re-open against dev instead, but it isn't worth fragmenting the conversations.)
