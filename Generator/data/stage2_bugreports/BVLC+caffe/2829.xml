	<summary>pycaffe net.forward() assumes end blobs have the same name as their layers</summary>
	<description>
If you call  from python, where  is a layer that has a different name for its output blob, _Net_forward() will attempt to access  (and in fact, returns this as the output).  This happens because &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/pycaffe.py#L80&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 appends the end layer name to the list of blobs to be output. If the appended name doesn't exist as a blob, the result is an exception.
Note that there may also be multiple outputs for the end layer, in which case the current behavior doesn't make sense either.

		I too had the same issue. For my application, I just needed to comment out the line "return {out: self.blobs[out].data for out in outputs}" in pycaffe.py. Forward propagation now happens without returning any blob vectors.

		Note that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/5519&gt;#5519&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixed the layer/top name issue!

		I just checked &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/5519&gt;#5519&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, called  on  layer with 2 tops and it worked just fine. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/shelhamer&gt;@shelhamer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 any example where it fails? I'll be glad to improve the code.
EDIT:  with  param pointing to a  with 4 bottoms and 4 tops, as well as  containing a list of 3 different blobs looks flawless.  to  layer mentioned previously also seemed to be good.

 sorry, I misspoke! It looks like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/5519&gt;#5519&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 handles everything

 Looks like this issue is fully resolved then :)
