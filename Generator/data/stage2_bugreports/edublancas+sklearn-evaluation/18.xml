	<summary>Do not assume the estimator has a estimators_ attribute</summary>
	<description>
The function to plot feature_importances assumes the estimator has a estimators_ property. This is true for some (e.g. rf, adaboost) but not for every estimator (e.g. decision tree). The function fails if called on a decision tree and that should not be the case.
