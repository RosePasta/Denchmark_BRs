	<summary>Notebook aml-pipelines-with-automated-machine-learning-step.ipynb throws errors and it's partially outdated</summary>
	<description>
This notebook was updated to version 1.2.0 and when running it, its pipeline training works.
However, part of it right at the end of the notebook is throwing errors:

Plus it needs to be updated so there are no warnings about APIs parameters being deprecated:

Also still talking about "" but should be "COMPUTE INSTANCE":
...If you are using an Azure Machine Learning **Notebook VM**...
I'll make sure this is fixed. I'll work on it.

		This notebook is already updated internally, we need to publish it in GitHub, here.
