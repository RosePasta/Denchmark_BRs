	<summary>[Bug] Build error at 'make install' time</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenVINO =&gt; git master (currently at commit 856ab82)
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Arch Linux x86_64
Compiler =&gt; gcc 10.2.0
Problem classification: build error
Framework: not applicable
Model name: not applicable

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm getting the following build error at make install time:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;CMake Error at inference-engine/src/gna_plugin/cmake_install.cmake:52 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot find
  "/storage/linux/abs/openvino-git/src/openvino/bin/intel64/Release/lib/libGNAPlugin.so":
  No such file or directory.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  inference-engine/src/cmake_install.cmake:53 (include)
  inference-engine/cmake_install.cmake:72 (include)
  cmake_install.cmake:61 (include)


make: *** [Makefile:159: install] Error 1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It builds fine but fails to install.
I can confirm that version &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/releases/tag/2021.2&gt;2021.2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 builds and installs fine, without this problem. This error happens only at the current git master.
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ mkdir -p openvino/build
$ cd openvino/build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_OPENCV=OFF ..
$ make
$ make DESTDIR=pkg install
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Issue submission checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I report the issue, it's not a question
 I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution
 There is reproducer code and related data files: images, videos, models, etc.

 Thank you for the reply. PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/3600&gt;#3600&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fails to apply on the current git master branch.

 looks strange because github prints if merge conflicts take place. But &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/3600&gt;#3600&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does not have them

Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

		Do you have the latest master?

		It comes from a clean git clone command, so it's the latest.
