&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenVINO =&gt; 2019.r2
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Windows 10 64 Bit
Compiler =&gt; Visual Studio 2015
Problem classification: Model inference
Framework: TensorFlow (if applicable)
Model name: unet

I have converted the model from kerase to .pb then to .xml  .bin
I successfully run the model  in c++ with openvino
but the result of c ++ is  different than the python result
I find that in python I send the image range (0ï¼Œ1)
but in c++ I send image range(0,255)
I want to send float to blob when I use function : matU8ToBlob&lt;uint8_t&gt; ,it works ok with image range(0,255)
I change it to matU8ToBlob &lt; float &gt;
but it always failed  when I put my  image in it ,
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Issue submission checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I report the issue, it's not a question


 I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution


 There is reproducer code and related data files: images, videos, models, etc.

Please install the latest OpenVINO 2021.1 build and give it a try on that. First, I would suggest to re-convert your .pb model over to IR format (bin/xml) with Model Optimizer from 2021.1 package and then test the resulted IR model with one of your images via the Python Benchmark app - &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool_README.html&gt;https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2020.3/_inference_engine_tools_benchmark_tool_README.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

A command should be like

python3 benchmark_app.py -m  -i
