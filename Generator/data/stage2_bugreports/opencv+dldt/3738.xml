	<description>
If I have compiled oneDNN and it has been changed by us, how can I compile it into openvino? Is this okay?

 I suppose you need to update submodule here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/inference-engine/thirdparty&gt;https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/tree/master/inference-engine/thirdparty&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But now sure that CPU plugin will work with your updated version.

		Seems like a duplicate with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/3706&gt;#3706&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If you custom oneDNN is based on OpenVINO's thirdparty oneDNN version - just apply the patch to thirdparty folder as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ilya-lavrenov&gt;@ilya-lavrenov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 pointed. If you use the newest version of oneDNN - see related topic regarding oneDNN update + PR.
