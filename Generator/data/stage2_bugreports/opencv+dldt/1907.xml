&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I hope this helps :)

 Yes, I use a self compiled build. In my case the model optimizer prints , I just thought it would be a similar bug. Is it still possible to add some versioning scheme to the source builds? E.g. the last commit hash or something like that. It would be nice for documentation to know which model optimizer version was used for conversion. If you want to I can open a separate issue for this wish.
