	<summary>Problem converting onnx model using inference engine</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm trying to optimize a custom network using the model optimizer using the following command
python mo_onnx.py --input_model  "C:\Users\erez.posner\Desktop\FDFE.onnx"
and get the following error (below):

in the network i use reshape and transpose functions in order to increase batch size during a forward run. basically i get a [1,1,H,W] image and during forward change the dimensions of the tensor e.g.
[4,1,H/2,H/2] .

i suspect an issue with batch dimension change during run. could this be the case? thank you

		erez can you kindly attach your model and also the exact MO command you used  so that we may assist you ? Also which version of ONNX are you using ?

		Certainly, thank you the the prompt response.
The model class is attached below. In addition there are the custom functions i.e. multiPoolPrepare, multiMaxPooling, unwrapPrepare, unwrapPool attached as well.
i know it is a lot. basically this custom model is supposed to receive as an input a [1,1,960,1280] tensor and output [1,113,960,1280] tensor. It initially pads the input tensor and then follows the layers.


the exact MO command is : python mo_onnx.py --input_model C:\Users\erez.posner\Desktop\FDFE.onnx


ONNX versions is 1.4.1

		Hi erez. I meant your ONNX model (not your Pytorch model). Can you kindly attach your exported onnx model ? Also add --log_level DEBUG to your MO command so that I can see the debug logs.

		erez what you attached is not an ONNX model, rather it seems to be a print of an ONNX model. I want to try mo_onnx.py myself - which is why I'm requesting a genuine onnx model. Anyway, let's try and debug just based on the print alone.
The error seems to be directly related to the warning prior to the exception

[ WARNING ]  Can't convert Reshape-&gt;Transpose(66)-&gt;Reshape sequence due to input shape should be 4D (instead of 6D)

Looking at the ONNX printout I see several examples of -1 in Tensor values. -1 is not an acceptable dimension value to Model Optimizer if it refers to incoming shape. Could this be the issue ? Numpy can infer dimensions based on -1 but Model Optimizer cannot. The builder of the model must be very specific about shape dimensions, starting with batch size. Additionally Line 67 is a 1x3 tensor while 61 and 64 are 1x6 tensors. The WARNING says the shape should be 4D. I would start though by getting rid of the -1 and see what happens next.
%67 : Tensor = onnx::Constant&lt;denchmark-link:&gt;value=   -1   960  1280 [ CPULongType{3} ]&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, scope: SlimNet
%61 : Tensor = onnx::Constant&lt;denchmark-link:&gt;value= 113  240  320    2    2   -1 [ CPULongType{6} ]&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, scope: SlimNet/unwrapPool[unwrapPool2]
%64 : Tensor = onnx::Constant&lt;denchmark-link:&gt;value= 113  480  640    2    2   -1 [ CPULongType{6} ]&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		sorry about that, my model is attached within the zip file here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/dldt/files/2924574/model.zip&gt;model.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

i'll try getting rid of any -1 and update.
thank you
