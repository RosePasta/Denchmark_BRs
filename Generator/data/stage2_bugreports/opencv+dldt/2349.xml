	<summary>[Bug] InferenceEngine::InferRequest::Infer() not thread safe</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;System information (version)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OpenVINO =&gt; Source build (latest commit ef2581d) from 2020-09-10
Operating System / Platform =&gt; Ubuntu 20.04
Compiler =&gt; g++ 9.3.0
Problem classification: Inference
Framework: TensorFlow 2.3.0

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Detailed description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I run multiple inference requests in their own threads. The thread looks like the following:
void thread()
{
    InferenceEngine::InferRequest inferRequest = mExeNet.CreateInferRequest();
    while(!stopThreads)
    {
        // set input blob
        inferRequest.Infer();
        // get output blob
    }
}
During runtime I get some synchronization issues. This means the output blob somehow does not belong to the input blob anymore.
When I replace
inferRequest.Infer();
with
inferRequest.StartAsync();
inferRequest.Wait(InferenceEngine::IInferRequest::WaitMode::RESULT_READY);
everything works fine.
I would assume that both cases work because it is documented in the Inference Engine Developer guide:

Both requests are thread-safe: can be called from different threads without fearing corruption and failures.

from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_IE_DG_Integrate_with_customer_application_new_API.html&gt;Documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Steps to reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h5&gt;Issue submission checklist&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I report the issue, it's not a question


 I checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues, Stack Overflow, etc and have not found solution


 There is reproducer code and related data files: images, videos, models, etc.

 I tried with today's source build (master branch with latest commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/commit/ef2aa3ad676564e99d368932987ba8e5b87483a9&gt;ef2aa3a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) but the issue still persists.

		At the moment I'm kind of busy but I can try to provide you a minimal working example in the next few weeks.
