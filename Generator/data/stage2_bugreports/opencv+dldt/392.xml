I'm trying to build this on Arch linux, but keep getting this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- DL_SDK_TEMP envionment not set

Status Legend:
(ERR):error occurred.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The actual file on download.01.org is opencv_4.2.0-082.txz. It looks like the filename is being built from a template like "opencv_{version}_{distro}.txz, but since distro is coming back blank, I end up with a dangling underscore at the end of the filename. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out where this is coming from. Does anyone know?
Thanks,
Aaron

		This error is caused by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/dldt/blob/2020/inference-engine/cmake/dependencies.cmake#L150&gt;https://github.com/opencv/dldt/blob/2020/inference-engine/cmake/dependencies.cmake#L150&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . It didn't find supported OS string, so it ends up with empty string, which broken the final URL.
I think you can disable OpenCV, or change  according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/issues/400&gt;#400&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
