 feature

Prefer using of system library (for example, installed via apt-get with "-dev" packages) instead of bundled 3rdparty code.

		Any update on this?  I had to disable the "add_subdir(pugixml)" line in inference-engine/thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt to avoid getting multiple cmake files that reference/depend on different versions of pugixml.  The InferenceEngine-*Debug.cmake referenced 1.0.7 while the system had a newer version installed.  The result was I couldn't build opencv with the InferenceEngine backend because pugixml 1.0.7 didn't exist on the system.
find_package is your friend.

		I would argue this is NOT a feature request, but a bug.  The result without this change is a broken dldt system (or elsewhere in compute stack) that may compile against or run against a different version than is intended.  Without the "hack" I did to fix this, I had runtime errors.

		We have a PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/pull/2502&gt;#2502&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This PR allows to use system pugixml.
