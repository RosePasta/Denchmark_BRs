	<summary>[ERROR] [Jetson Nano] Device doesn't appear after boot</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I faced with the following problem while building then running the face-detection example from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BeloborodovDS/NCS-face&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;MYRIAD plugin version: myriadPlugin custom_2019_b0c5accaf8e0c0fac17aaef688478d7f391d05bb 2.1
E: [ncAPI] [    257984] [demo] ncDeviceOpen:859	Device doesn't appear after boot
Cannot load network into NCS, probably device not connected
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'd followed the installation of DLDT on Jetson Nano here : &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MrJBSwe/NCS2-and-Coral-TPU-on-aarch64&gt;https://github.com/MrJBSwe/NCS2-and-Coral-TPU-on-aarch64&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Any hint?
Thanks in advance.
Pascal

		Please check usb rules: /etc/udev/rules.d/97-*
And post an output of "lsusb"

		From the link you mentioned (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MrJBSwe/NCS2-and-Coral-TPU-on-aarch64&gt;https://github.com/MrJBSwe/NCS2-and-Coral-TPU-on-aarch64&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) it is this important section:

8.0 Myriad-rules ? ( seems to work without it )
from l_openvino_toolkit_raspbi_p_2019.1.094.tgz
$sudo cp 97-myriad-usbboot.rules_.txt /etc/udev/rules.d/97-myriad-usbboot.rules
$udevadm control --reload-rules
$udevadm trigger
$ldconfig

Then plugin the MyriadX NeuralComputeStick2.
Then call "lsusb"; you should see the device, note the vendorid and deviceid.
When you run your application immediately call "lsusb" again; while the vendorid stays the same the deviceid changes.
When the application exists (and after a little timeout) call "lsusb" again and you will see the previous vendorid and deviceid.

		It seems that the issue is not actual as no response. Closing it. Feel free to reopen it or better create a new one.
