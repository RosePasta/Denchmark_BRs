	<summary>OpenPoseConfig.cmake includes openpose and caffe folders</summary>
	<description>
When using openpose as an external library via cmake, like
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/path/to/openpose/install ..
and using
FIND_PACKAGE(OpenPose)
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${OpenPose_INCLUDE_DIRS})
we get error like
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;fatal error: openpose/core/headers.hpp: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

because at lines



openpose/cmake/OpenPoseConfig.cmake.in


         Line 8
      in
      5401f66






 set(Caffe_INCLUDE_DIRS "${_prefix}/include/caffe") 





and



openpose/cmake/OpenPoseConfig.cmake.in


         Line 13
      in
      5401f66






 set(OpenPose_INCLUDE_DIRS "${_prefix}/include/openpose") 





openpose and caffe folders are included. We cannot do
#include &lt;openpose/core/headers.hpp&gt;
Workaround can be
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${OpenPose_INCLUDE_DIRS}/..)
but in the OpenPoseConfig.cmake, it should be
set(Caffe_INCLUDE_DIRS "${_prefix}/include/")
set(OpenPose_INCLUDE_DIRS "${_prefix}/include/")
