	<summary>Unexpected termination without processing all images in directory - write_coco_json</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have more than 40 000 coco validation images in the directory. But the demo only process 3599 of them and terminated with a success message. How to fix this?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Executed command (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --image_dir ./../coco/val2014/ --write_coco_json coco_result.json
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;OpenPose output (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Type of issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		The COCO extractor was still an experimental module only meant for internal purposes. I have just finished it and pushed it to the repository.
Let me know if you find more issues.
Side note: In case you want to process a subset of images, you can specify the first-last frames to process by --frame_first &amp; --frame_last (both 0-based).
