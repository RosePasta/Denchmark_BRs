	<summary>Build fails on clean Ubuntu 18.04 for CPU_ONLY version</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When trying to build openpose on a clean Ubuntu 18.04 machine configured to CPU_ONLY version the build process failes at two locations:
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

1.) While building Caffe the following error occurs:
/home/rinf/restless/openpose/openpose/3rdparty/caffe/src/caffe/layers/mkldnn_inner_product_layer.cpp: In member function ‘void caffe::MKLDNNInnerProductLayer::InitInnerProductBwd(const std::vector&lt;caffe::Blob&gt;&amp;, const std::vector&amp;, const std::vector&lt;caffe::Blob&gt;&amp;)’:
/home/rinf/restless/openpose/openpose/3rdparty/caffe/src/caffe/layers/mkldnn_inner_product_layer.cpp:361:2: error: this ‘else’ clause does not guard... [-Werror=misleading-indentation]
else
^~~~
/home/sophos/openpose/3rdparty/caffe/src/caffe/layers/mkldnn_inner_product_layer.cpp:365:5: note: ...this statement, but the latter is misleadingly indented as if it is guarded by the ‘else’
ipBwdData_desc.reset(new inner_product_backward_data::desc(init_bottom_md, init_weights_md, init_top_md));
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors
src/caffe/CMakeFiles/caffe.dir/build.make:1742: recipe for target 'src/caffe/CMakeFiles/caffe.dir/layers/mkldnn_inner_product_layer.cpp.o' failed
Solution:
This can be solved by adding { } braces on line 359 and 362 in file
3rdparty/caffe/src/caffe/layers/mkldnn_inner_product_layer.cpp
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

2.) While building Caffe the following errors occur:
../../caffe/lib/libcaffe.so: undefined reference to MLSL::ParameterSet::GetLocalKernelCount()' ../../caffe/lib/libcaffe.so: undefined reference to MLSL::Environment::Wait(int*)'
../../caffe/lib/libcaffe.so: undefined reference to `MLSL::Environment::DeleteSession(MLSL::Session*)'
[...]
Solution:
This can be solved by manually copying the MLSL-Libs under the 3rdparty/caffe/external/ to the /usr/lib/ directory.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Additionally: After manually solving these errors openpose compiles but execution of build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin failes with following error:
"Attempting to use an MPI routine before initializing MPI"
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Executed Command (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

apt-get install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libopencv-dev libgoogle-glog-dev libhdf5-dev cmake-qt-gui libboost-all-dev git
git clone &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.git&gt;https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.git&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

cd openpose
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
Set GPU_MODE to CPU_ONLY and click Configure and Generate and exit
make
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;OpenPose Output (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		I've been able to get an Ubuntu 18 to test, please allow me some time to debug this issue (hopefully today). Thanks!

		ok, I could make it work after a quick fix. Please, try the latest code version of OP for this. Let me know otherwise
PS: In order to use it, remove the whole OpenPose folder and re-download it, otherwise the changes in Caffe might not be updated when git pulling the code.
(For your Debian issue, I don't think it's the same error, but you should definitively try it out too).

		Sorry to necro-bump this, but I have the same error (warning) as sopho22, also on Ubuntu 18.04 with CPU_ONLY. You mention that master should contain a quick fix, but the below occurs based on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/commit/0a7d5b8e22db0b26b14ca3f3f8060299d3ee967d&gt;0a7d5b8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for OpenPose and b5ede488952e40861e84e51a9f9fd8fe2395cc8a for the custom Caffe fork.
Although the line numbers differ slightly. Let me know if I should open a new issue.

PS: As a workaround, disable MKL, for example:
RUN cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON -DGPU_MODE=CPU_ONLY -DUSE_MKL=OFF ..
