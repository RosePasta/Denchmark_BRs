&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Posting rules&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Duplicated posts will not be answered. Check the FAQ section, other GitHub issues, and general documentation before posting. E.g., low-speed, out-of-memory, output format, 0-people detected, installation issues, ...).
Fill the Your System Configuration section (all of it or it will not be answered!) if you are facing an error or unexpected behavior. Feature requests or some other type of posts might not require it.
No questions about training or 3rd party libraries:

OpenPose only implements testing.
Caffe errors/issues, check Caffe documentation.
CUDA check failed errors: They are usually fixed by re-installing CUDA, then re-installing the proper cuDNN version, and then re-compiling (or re-installing) OpenPose. Otherwise, check for help in CUDA forums.
OpenCV errors: Install the default/pre-compiled OpenCV or check for online help.


Set a proper issue title: add the Ubuntu/Windows keyword and be specific (e.g., do not call it: Error).
Only English comments.
Posts which do not follow these rules will be ignored, closed, or reported with no further clarification.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

A possible typo in line 60 of file 01_body_from_image_default.cpp
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Errors (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

when compile, the following error appears:
\openpose\examples\tutorial_api_cpp\01_body_from_image_default.cpp(60): error C2039: 'poseKeypoints': is not a member of 'std::shared_ptrop::Datum'
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following change resolves the error:
from :         const auto&amp; poseKeypoints = datumsPtr-&gt;at(0).poseKeypoints;
to :             const auto&amp; poseKeypoints = datumsPtr-&gt;at(0)-&gt;poseKeypoints;
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Your System Configuration&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		There was a copy-paste in my original report. The compiling  error is :
openpose\examples\tutorial_api_cpp\01_body_from_image_default.cpp(60): error C2039: 'poseKeypoints': is not a member of 'std::shared_ptr&lt;op::Datum&gt;'
It is also checked on VS2017 windows 10. the same error appears
It seems in GitHub, the contents in comment: write  differs from those in comment: preview.
