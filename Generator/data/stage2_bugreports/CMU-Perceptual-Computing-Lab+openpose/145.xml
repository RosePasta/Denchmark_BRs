	<summary>openpose compile error</summary>
	<description>
I remove the old version by rm -rf openpose then reinstalled following the instruction:
git clone &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.git&gt;https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.git&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

cd openpose
bash ./ubuntu/install_caffe_and_openpose_if_cuda8.sh
