	<summary>Version of CudNN in Cuda.make</summary>
	<description>
Dear Developers,
I found and possibly solved a problem related to CudNN version in Cuda.make and FindCuDNN.cmake.
They look on the CudNN version in the following line:
file(READ ${CUDNN_INCLUDE}/cudnn.h CUDNN_VERSION_FILE_CONTENTS)
however, the version information are in cudnn_version.h.
The line should become
file(READ ${CUDNN_INCLUDE}/cudnn_version.h CUDNN_VERSION_FILE_CONTENTS)
Thanks,
Manuel

		Can confirm this works by changing line 237 in cmake/Cuda.cmake
from
    file(READ ${CUDNN_INCLUDE}/cudnn.h CUDNN_VERSION_FILE_CONTENTS
to
    file(READ ${CUDNN_INCLUDE}/cudnn_version.h CUDNN_VERSION_FILE_CONTENTS

EDIT1 :This step however faces a new problem: Caffe isn't fixed to compile on Cuda 11 Cudnn 8.0.3.33
EDIT2 : OpenPose will be hitting a wall with Cuda 11/Cudnn8. only compiling on windows works. A total code rewrite on pytorch (which merged with caffee) can give it life. Or if someone builds a custom caffe config for new cudnn
POST: If there are still problems then just done compile with cudnn

FYI, I did fix Caffe for cudnn8 here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jolibrain/caffe/pull/75&gt;jolibrain/caffe#75&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for other purposes.
This apply to our custom version of Caffe, but it'd be straightforward to merge the relevant files into vanilla Caffe.

		Hi, I actually solved all these issues today. Feel free to re-install the latest OpenPose. Let me know if any issues occur, thanks!
