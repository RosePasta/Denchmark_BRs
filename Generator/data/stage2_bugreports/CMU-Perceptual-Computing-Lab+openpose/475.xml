	<summary>part_candidate coordinates problem</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I use the following command to save the body part candidates. As far as I know, body part candidates and PAFs are the input of the paper's optimization algorithm to get the final person keypoints. So in the output file, i.e. 1_keypoints.json, i think that the "pose_keypoints" is the final person keypoints and the
"part_candidates" is the body part candidates. And i think the points in "pose_keypoints" is coming from "part_candidates". But the result is not like that, I can't find the points in "pose_keypoints" from "part_candidates". And when i plot the "part_candidates" in the input image, the result is wrong, the point is not in the place of joints.
A bit wordy, but hopefully you can understand what I mean.
thanks

		Actually it's a scale issue (which I forgot to mention in the doc). pose_keypoints should be scaled to the output image resolution (unless you specify a different scale). However, part_candidates is the output of the deep net, so its resolution is in net_resolution scale. I'll put them into the same scale (and notify though this issue thread), but if you wanna make an immediate sense of them, simply rescale them

		ok, i get it. Thanks

		(I'll keep it open so I'll remember to fix that they have different scales and then post it here)

		oh, thanks
I just have a try to rescale the part_candidates.
I do it as following:
if the size of input image is (491, 640, 3), and i use this command to get the json file:
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --image_dir examples/media/input/ --part_candidates --write_json output/heatmaps/5/
Thus, i think the net_resolution is (368, 656). So if the coordinate of one point from the part_candidates is (184.988,92.0557), i think the rescaled point is (184.988 *491/368, 92.0557 *656/640). But when i plot the rescaled point, i find the y coordinate is wrong.
Do i understand right?

		Any updates on this? I'd also like to use the part-candidates with the right resolution. Alternatively, is there a way to spit out the net resolution (when using "-1x368", it's not clear to me what the "-1" becomes)

		Hi all ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DongJT1996&gt;@DongJT1996&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chrisdxie&gt;@chrisdxie&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ). The problem has been fixed in the latest commit which i've just pushed a few seconds ago. Now, part_candidates will always have the same scale than the keypoints themselves. Thanks for the feed-back! (and feel free to post if something is still not working)

		could you tell me the information that comes through the Json file  as a result of --part_candidates. I am having trouble understanding it when i apply --part_candidates to an image with two people.

		The body part candidates before being assembled into people (if --part_candidates is enabled). I.e., all the points that could be a body keypoint.
