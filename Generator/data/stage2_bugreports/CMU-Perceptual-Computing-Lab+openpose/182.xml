Be sure, that you have the last version of Openpose.


Anyway you can download this file manually. Like it seems in your log, somehow u can't download
         http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/OpenPose/models/pose/coco/pose_iter_440000.caffemodel



That is available manually. Just insert this link to the browser, and save this file to
{openpose_folder}\models\pose\coco\

 I understand that the CMU link to caffe models is down. Are there different versions of caffemodels for ubuntu and windows? I've windows caffe models saved but need to run openpose in ubuntu(running on windows is not an option). If they are different,, does anyone have ubuntu version of caffe models hosted elsewhere?
When I manually uploaded the windows caffe models and tried to run openpose, it fails with the message below.

		Ubuntu models are just auto-downloaded with CMake from another GitHub repo, that is not down.

@shadkain All models are on Kaggle, select Download (783 MB) next to New Notebook and it will give you all of them. https://www.kaggle.com/changethetuneman/openpose-model

After downloading what's the correct route to paste the models?
