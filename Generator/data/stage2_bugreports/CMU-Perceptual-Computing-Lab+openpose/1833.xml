&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Unable to build openpose for Python in Colab using DBUILD_PYTHON=ON after latest commit

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Executed Command (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

!cd openpose &amp;&amp; rm -rf build || true &amp;&amp; mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build &amp;&amp; cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON .. &amp;&amp; make -jnproc 
Hi,
Recently there was an issue building Openpose with the latest commit on Colab about 12 hours ago (specifically for Ubuntu as Gines had mentioned in a previous issue). It was fixed and now we can build Openpose. However, building it Colab for python using 'cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON' command is still an issue and we get an error (log file at the end). As a result, we don't get the folder called as 'python' under 'build' folder under 'openpose'. The DBUILD_PYTHON=ON command was working perfectly in Colab previously. Please let us know if you know a solution to fix it.
Also do let us know if you need any more information. Since this is my first time raising an issue on Github do let us know if you need to change the format of the issue raised here.
Thanks for your help

		I have the same issue. When using colab I can build openpose for C++, but when I set DBUILD_PYTHON=ON to build it for Python,
I get a simmilar error.
