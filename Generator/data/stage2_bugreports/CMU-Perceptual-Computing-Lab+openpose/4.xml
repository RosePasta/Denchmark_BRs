	<summary>No output displayed or it gets stuck - OpenCV issue</summary>
	<description>
my terminal isn't responding after executed the command below:
./build/examples/openpose/rtpose.bin --image_dir examples/media/ --logging_level 1 --net_resolution 496x368 --resolution 640x480
since i got the following message:

i'm running on ubuntu16 with opencv3
other requires were setup by ./install_caffe_and_openpose.sh , which was provided by official

		Sorry to hear that, we are working on fixing that error. We think it is due to OpenCV compiled with Qt or different visualization support.
Meanwhile, you can make it work by:

Completely uninstalling your current OpenCV version.
Installing the default OpenCV from the Ubuntu repository: apt-get install libopencv-dev, or alternatively compiling OpenCV without Qt support.
Let us know if any of these solutions do not work either. Note that you must manually remove any existing OpenCV version and run make clean in both 3rdparty/caffe and the OpenPose main folder

A couple quick questions:

Does the same happen when processing video?
./build/examples/openpose/rtpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --logging_level 1 --net_resolution 496x368 --resolution 640x480
Does it work if no output is displayed?
./build/examples/openpose/rtpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --logging_level 1 --net_resolution 496x368 --resolution 640x480 --write_images results_folder/ --no_display

We will notify this thread once we solve this issue with OpenCV. Thanks!
UPDATED: This issue should be fixed now. See my next response on this issue thread to see solution.

		thanks!!! i solved it by switching the opencv version to 2.4.13
(btw, simply execute sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev doesnt work for me,
so i recompiled and install the total opencv then it worked)
and for the questions above, the same issue DO occurs when processing video...
i have to say this really works amazingly!! great work:)

		This issue has finally being solved (at least for some people after our last commit).
You can git pull or re-download the latest version of the library and re-compile it.
To re-compile it in case you just do git pull:
make clean &amp;&amp; cd 3rdparty/caffe &amp;&amp; make clean &amp;&amp; make distribute -j8 &amp;&amp; cd ../.. &amp;&amp; make all -j8
In case you re-download it, just delete the old version and follow the installation steps again.
Please, reopen this post and post again if it keeps happening (this message is for everybody).

		Hi
I am facing the same issue on Ubuntu 18.04 with Opencv 4.1.1. The screen opens up but blacks out with no output. I am facing this for images and videos.
Any help would be appreciated

		This is happening to me on Ubuntu 16.04 using sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev. Any help appreciated.
