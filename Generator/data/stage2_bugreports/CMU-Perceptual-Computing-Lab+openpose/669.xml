	<summary>About 3D real-time multi-person keypoint detection</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I find that there is some thing about the 3D real-time multi-person keypoint detection, as shown below:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25705996/41849822-f3c3f158-78b4-11e8-8417-b6995a452c8b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But, i just find 3D reconstruction for only 1 person from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/modules/3d_reconstruction_module.md&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I just want to know whether there is something about 3D multi-person keypoint detection that i didn't find?
thank you

		Hi.
You are right, right now 3-D is only for single person. I have fixed that typo in the README.md for the next commit.
Multi-person 3D will take some time (months), as it requires some kind of person re-association between frames.
