	<summary>Windows installation</summary>
	<description>
Hello, I just wanted to suggest just a little fix for the documentation.
In the Windows installation section, point &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/issues/2&gt;#2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, it is said to execute:
git clone https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/ &amp;&amp; git checkout windows
but before executing git checkout windows it is necessary to execute cd openpose.
Keep up the good work,
Nicola
