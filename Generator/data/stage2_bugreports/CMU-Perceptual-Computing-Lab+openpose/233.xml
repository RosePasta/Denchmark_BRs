&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System Configuration&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Windows 10 Pro
Visual Studio 2015
CUDA 8.0
cuDNN 5.1
Graphic card:Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I installed OpenPose as described in the instructions(doc/installation.md).
I compiled, but I can't execute OpenPoseDemo.exe with error.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Executed command (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As described in the instructions.


In order to verify OpenPose is working, try compiling and executing the demo:
1. Right click on OpenPoseDemo --&gt; Set as StartUp Project.
2. Change Debug by Release mode.
3. Compile it and run it with F5 or the green play icon.


&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;OpenPose output (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is an output on VisualStudio(Translated).
Exception thrown at 0x00007FFE5DBC0372 (OpenPose.dll) (in OpenPoseDemo.exe): 0xC0000005: An access violation occurred while reading the location 0x0000000000000008
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Type of issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
