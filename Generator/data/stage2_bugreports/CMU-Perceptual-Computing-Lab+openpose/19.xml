&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zhaishengfu&gt;@zhaishengfu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/issues/13&gt;#13&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

When i compile using debug mode, there are still errors with:
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
what():
Error:
Cuda check failed (7 vs. 0): too many resources requested for launch


Coming from:



src/openpose/pose/poseRenderGpu.cu:renderPoseGpu():439
src/openpose/pose/poseRenderGpu.cu:renderPoseGpu():444
src/openpose/pose/poseRenderer.cpp:renderPose():285**



So Why This happen? and Why the release can work? Could you tell me what is my problem?? what is the core difference with these 2 files?

, I moved your last question to this new issue thread since it is different from your previous one. I will answer as soon as possible.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Executed command (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;OpenPose output (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Type of issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
