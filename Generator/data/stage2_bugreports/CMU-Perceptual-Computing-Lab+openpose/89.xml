		Hi, sorry for the error! does it compile if you add this line at the top of src/openpose/utilities/keypoint.cpp?
#include &lt;opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp&gt; // cv::line, cv::circle

		Thanks for the quick reply.
That fix cleared the previous issue, now when i run the install script, i see

		You are using an old version (experimental/hand/ is not longer there). Could you try downloading the last version and try it?
(in addition I just pushed the fix to your first question, so it should be ready-to-compile without any changes). Let me know your result. Thanks!

		Perfect! Thanks for your help. Works like a charm with opencv 3.
