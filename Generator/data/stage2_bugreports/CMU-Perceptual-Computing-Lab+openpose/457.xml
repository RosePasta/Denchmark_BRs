	<summary>A problem about CMakeLists.txt while installing</summary>

openstack@ubuntu:~/openpose$ make
-- GCC detected, adding compile flags
CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:105 (find_package):
By not providing "FindOpenCL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "OpenCL", but
CMake did not find one.
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenCL" with any
of the following names:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;OpenCLConfig.cmake
opencl-config.cmake
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Add the installation prefix of "OpenCL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"OpenCL_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "OpenCL"
provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
installed.

		Please, try the version I have just pushed. Let me know whether it works or not, ideally it should work now. Thanks

		It's finding a folder called /home/openstack/openpose/src/openpose/CMakeFiles, there should not be any folder with that name there. Could you manually delete it?

		An Nvidia graphics card is required to run OpenPose, that's why is failing.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/issues/375&gt;#375&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
