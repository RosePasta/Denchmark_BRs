&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Posting rules&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Add the system configuration (all of it!), command and output if you have some kind of error or performance question.
No duplicated posts.
No posts about questions already answered / clearly explained in the documentation (e.g. no more low-speed nor out-of-memory questions).
Set a proper issue title: add the Ubuntu/Windows word and be specific (e.g. do not simple call it: Compile error).
Only English comments.
Issues/comments that do not follow this will be ignored or removed with no further clarification.

Issue summary
The openpose will not work with opencv 3.3.0-rc. when run the demo openpose, will raise malloc error.
The problem to casue this is the opencv 3.3.0-rc cv::mat add a constructor with initilizer list in file  opencv2/core/mat.inl.hpp:581.  and in openpose file src/openpose/utilities/openCv.cpp:34. where use initilizer list to initilize the cv::mat.
so just change the code from
cvMat = cv::Mat{resolutionSize.y, resolutionSize.x, CV_8UC3};
to
cvMat = cv::Mat(resolutionSize.y, resolutionSize.x, CV_8UC3);
can sovle this problem
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Executed command (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Note: add --logging_level 0 to get higher debug information.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;OpenPose output (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Type of issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
