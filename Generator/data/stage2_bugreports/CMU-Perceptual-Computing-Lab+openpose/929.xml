	<summary>Fails due to symbol collision with OpenCV 4.0.0-rc</summary>
	<description>
There is a series of #defines that clash with opencv variable names.
One example:
Openpose's macros.hpp line here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/include/openpose/core/macros.hpp#L118&gt;https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/include/openpose/core/macros.hpp#L118&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

which clashes with the OpenCV include enum: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.0.0-rc/modules/imgcodecs/include/opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp#L62&gt;https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.0.0-rc/modules/imgcodecs/include/opencv2/imgcodecs.hpp#L62&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and results in code, after the preprocessor runs, that looks like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;enum
{

    CV_LOAD_IMAGE_UNCHANGED =-1,

    
   cv::IMREAD_GRAYSCALE 
                            =0,

    
   cv::IMREAD_COLOR 
                            =1,

    
   cv::IMREAD_ANYDEPTH 
                            =2,

    CV_LOAD_IMAGE_ANYCOLOR =4,

    CV_LOAD_IMAGE_IGNORE_ORIENTATION =128
};
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jimfcarroll&gt;@jimfcarroll&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Which OpenCV exact version are you using? This code does work with OpenCV 2.4.X, 3.X, and 4.0.0-beta on my machine. I haven't tried the new 4.0.0 pre-release. Thanks!

		<comment id='2' author='jimfcarroll' date='2018-11-15T21:51:28Z'>
		4.0.0-rc is the tag. It's the release candidate and the most recent tag.
EDIT: I updated the link to the OpenCV imgcodec.hpp line to the exact tag.

		<comment id='3' author='jimfcarroll' date='2018-11-15T21:53:13Z'>
		OK, thanks for the info. I added the fix in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/include/openpose/core/macros.hpp#L118&gt;https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/include/openpose/core/macros.hpp#L118&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to actually make it work with 4.0.0 alpha and beta versions. They seem to have added back those enums in 4.0.0-rc. I will try to make it work also with 4.0.0-rc and keep you posted...

		It probably doesn't make too much sense spinning on it until the actual release but I just thought I'd try it since it's at a release candidate and I noticed you had 4.0.0 specific code so I figured I'd let you know.
		</comment>
		<comment id='5' author='jimfcarroll' date='2018-11-16T00:13:52Z'>
		OK, fixed in the latest commit. Now all 4.0.0 versions works (alpha, beta, and rc). Let me know otherwise!

		<comment id='6' author='jimfcarroll' date='2018-11-16T14:55:14Z'>
		Great. I'll give it a shot.

		<comment id='7' author='jimfcarroll' date='2018-11-16T15:23:01Z'>
		Well. This failed for me also but for a different reason. Your latest code seems to depend on OpenCVs DNN (which I personally think it a mistake but, as a total guess, I'm assuming maybe you're trying to move away from Caffe 1.0). I specifically disable OpenCVs DNN because it conflicts with Caffe 1.0 (partially due to protobufs but I don't think that's the complete issue).
I'll do more investigation but do you have any suggestions?
Thanks
Jim

		I should note, I build Caffe separately to fine tune the parameters:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;NCCL_DIR=/usr/local/cuda/nccl OpenCV_DIR="/home/jim/utils/opencv4.0.0-rc-cuda9.2/installed/lib/cmake/opencv4" "cmake" -DCUDA_ARCH_BIN="30 35 50 60 61" -DCUDA_ARCH_PTX= -DCUDA_ARCH_NAME=Manual -DUSE_LMDB=OFF -DUSE_LEVELDB=OFF -DUSE_NCCL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/home/jim/utils/openpose/caffe-build"/installed ../sources/caffe
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This results in a cmake output:

		Sorry for the series of messages. It looks like the define for OPEN_CV_DNN_AVAILABLE isn't being set correctly for my build.

		I see what's happening. I think I can fix it for you. I'll submit a PR later.

		In my case, OpenCV DNN and Caffe are running both fine and together with no issues. Not sure why it crashes on your PC. However, I should have added OpenCV DNN module as optional (and disabled by default), so it doesn't crash in machines configured like yours.
Please, try the latest commit, OpenCV DNN is disabled by default (as it should have been done initially).
I also look forward to see your PR (if you still thing is useful). Thanks!

		Well, I'm not a cmake guru and it looks like it's going to be difficult to determine automatically if OpenCV's DNN is part of the find_package for OpenCV. It looks like I'd have to scan the resulting library link line for opencv_dnn or the includes for the appropriate directory. This seem circuitous and brittle. So I was going to do what (I'm guessing) you did which was just make it explicit on the OpenPose build.

		Yeah that's fine. I will do it properly when we really add the OpenCV DNN module. For now, their module only works with CPU-only or Intel GPU (OpenCL) versions, so it is not worth at this point.

Heh. That's why I suggested I didn't think it was the right direction if you were going to replace Caffe. I doubt it will ever be otherwise since Intel now controls the OpenCV.
