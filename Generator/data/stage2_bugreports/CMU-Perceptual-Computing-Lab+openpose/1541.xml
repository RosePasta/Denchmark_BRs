	<summary>openpose debug build uses incorrect runtime library</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Summary&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When an openpose project is created, the debug configuration is set to use the release runtime library. When this is changed, openpose no longer compiles due to linker errors.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Executed Command (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Cmake configure for MSVC 2017 with x64 flag set
Cmake generate
for the openpose dll project, debug configuration...
change C/C++ -&gt; Code Generation -&gt; Runtime Library from /MD to /MDd (multi threaded debug dll)
Build Project

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;OpenPose Output (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

None
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Errors (if any)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

LNK4049
LNK4217

		It seems to have something to do with nvcc compiled obj files being built with the wrong runtime library as well.
1&gt;openpose_generated_pyramidalLK.cu.obj : error LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary': value 'MD_DynamicRelease' doesn't match value 'MDd_DynamicDebug' in cameraParameterReader.obj
After some investigation:
Changing CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to DEBUG, has no effect on its own.
BUT, adding -D_DEBUG -g to CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_DEBUG is enough to get the library to compile.

Might follow up if more issues arise

		Actually, OpenPose was not using any of the 3rdparty debug libraries at all.
I have just pushed a relatively big change to all the CMake system to enable the debug mode "for real". It all works on my machine, but please, let me know if you face any issues!
(Closing it for now, but Procdox or anyone else feel free to answer in this thread if any issue arises from Debug in coming days!)
