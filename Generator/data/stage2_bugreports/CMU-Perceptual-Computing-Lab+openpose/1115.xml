	<summary>Command "--hand_alpha_pose 1" does nothing at all</summary>
	<description>
I'm using OpenPose v1.4.0 Win64 GPU binaries to output the skeleton in solid colors (no transparency) and black background using this command:
bin\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\media\video.avi --face --hand --alpha_pose 1 --face_alpha_pose 1 --hand_alpha_pose 1 --hand_tracking --disable_blending --write_images C:\openpose\frames
Everything shows correctly except the hands, they're the only elements that have transparency applied to them, whatever value I apply to --hand_alpha_pose 1 doesn't change anything at all, am I doing anything wrong?
Any help is much appreciated, thanks!

		It seems like it has been broken since day 0 but noone reported it earlier. My apologies. Fixed in the latest commit!
