	<summary>Compilation/installation error C2397 VS2015, CUDA8.0</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
when I try to build the openpose with VS2015 I encountered the following error:
Error C2397:	conversion from 'unsigned __int64' to 'std::size_t' requires a narrowing conversion	C:***\openpose\core\array.cpp	line 636
Environment:
VS2015 Community
CUDA8.0 with Cudnn 5.1
I searched the internet but cannot get any useful information. Any suggestions what is wrong?
Thanks!

		OK, I fixed that issue in the latest commit.
I do not have VS 2015 community (and it can't be downloaded anymore), so please, feel free to send me any further feed-back or new errors you encounter in there. Thanks! (It works in VS 2015 Enterprise Update 3)
