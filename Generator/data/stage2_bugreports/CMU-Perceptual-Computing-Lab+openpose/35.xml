		I will change the message so it is more informative.
But the process_real_time option was meant for video. For webcam (as you are trying), that option is applied by default, since the webcam will automatically drop frames if the speed is too slow.
I will avoid the program to send an error with ./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --process_real_time since it is actually applied by default. But meanwhile, simply use ./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin, it is completely equivalent for webcam.

		As I said before, there is no practical difference for webcam in using process_real_time or not, but at least now it does not throw an error. Thanks for the catch.
