		Hello :) !
It seems that the current provided OpenCV for Windows does not include all necessary headers.
I was able to solve the issue by copying the file cudaimgproc.hpp from the OpenCV sources to 3rdparty/windows/opencv/include.

		And with the latest commit, cudawarping.hpp is also needed.

		I just realised that copying the headers did not solve the issue, it just pushed it up to linking. I suppose it means OpenCV needs to be compiled anew to include this new dependencies... ?

		Here is the error I'm now getting :

openpose_generated_pyramidalLK.cu.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "void __cdecl cv::cuda::pyrDown(class cv::_InputArray const &amp;,class cv::_OutputArray const &amp;,class cv::cuda::Stream &amp;)" (?pyrDown@cuda@cv@@YAXAEBV_InputArray@2@AEBV_OutputArray@2@AEAVStream@12@@z) referenced in function "void __cdecl op::buildGaussianPyramid(class std::vector&lt;class cv::cuda::GpuMat,class std::allocator &gt; &amp;,class cv::Mat const &amp;,int)" (?buildGaussianPyramid@op@@YAXAEAV?$vector@VGpuMat@cuda@cv@@v?$allocator@VGpuMat@cuda@cv@@@std@@@std@@AEBVMat@cv@@h@Z)
