	<summary>Slight documentation typo in CPU speed discussion</summary>
	<description>
The CPU version code says:

The default CPU version takes ~0.2 seconds per image on Ubuntu (~50x slower than GPU) while the MKL version provides a roughly 2x speedup at ~0.4 seconds

I think this number is images/frames per second rather than seconds per image. Is that the case?

		Thanks for the catch! Fixed in my local doc, it'll be pushed with my next commit within the next week.
