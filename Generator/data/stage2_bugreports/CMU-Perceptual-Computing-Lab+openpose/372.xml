	<summary>[v1.2.1] POSE_COCO_BODY_PARTS not available through the API anymore</summary>
	<description>
Hi everyone,
until recently I've been using POSE_COCO_BODY_PARTS that had been defined in poseParameters.hpp to get the names of the body parts corresponding to their index.
As of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/commit/b3c04ec0d475f15c05a4e2140da28961092adc90&gt;b3c04ec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that array isn't available anymore and I wonder how I'm supposed to get the body part name per body part index now. I'd be happy if anyone could elaborate on that change.
Cheers!
