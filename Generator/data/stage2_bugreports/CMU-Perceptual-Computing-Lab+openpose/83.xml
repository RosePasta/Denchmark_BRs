	<description>
Amazing work and contributions in OpenPose. Thank all the authors.
When I was using "examples/tutorial_pose/2_extract_pose_or_heatmat_from_image.cpp", it was found that merely mofidying the values of FLAGS_alpha_pose and FLAGS_alpha_heatmap did not work. Then I looked into the code and found that the 5th parameter (const bool blendOriginalFrame) was missing.
This issue could be solved by modifying the code from:
pPoseRenderer = new op::PoseRenderer{netOutputSize, outputSize, poseModel,
pPoseExtractor, (float)FLAGS_alpha_pose, (float)FLAGS_alpha_heatmap};
to
pPoseRenderer = new op::PoseRenderer{netOutputSize, outputSize, poseModel,
pPoseExtractor, true, (float)FLAGS_alpha_pose, (float)FLAGS_alpha_heatmap};
Enjoy OpenPose!

		I just updated them and incorporated the proper flag (disable_blending).
Let me know if you find any further issues.
Thanks!
