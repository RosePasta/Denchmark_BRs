		I'd try to debug the error, the problem is that my machine does have CUDA, so I can't detect this error on it.
As quick fix, could you try copying the CUDA DLLs from the GPU version for now? Does that work?

Could you please try this provisional version? (done with the help of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/soulslicer&gt;@soulslicer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gineshidalgo99/openpose/tree/cpu&gt;https://github.com/gineshidalgo99/openpose/tree/cpu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If it works, I will push it to OpenPose.
Again, we don't have a machine without Nvidia (CUDA) installed on it, so we can't detect all the errors, but we compiled a CPU-only version of Caffe, so it should work and not request any CUDA dependency. Please, let me know if it works, and if it doesn't, please post here the error. Thanks!
A proof for you to verify it was configured properly is that you should have a 3rdparty/windows/caffe_cpu folder after running CMake with CPU_ONLY option. Otherwise, let me know.

 If you did not get 3rdparty/windows/caffe_cpu, that means you are not using the right repository, or that you didn't follow the CPU instructions (basically set CPU_ONLY in CMake).
Let me know your output after you can see that caffe_cpu is there. Thanks!

		That's an out-of-memory (RAM) error (check FAQ and/or speed up hints). Please, reduce net_resolution to e.g. -1x80 to verify whether it runs properly other than the RAM memory issue.

  I also tried the version you uploaded, but I was not able to run it.
First I tried to run it through Visual Studio after compiled it, but I obtained a long list of line regarding the layers and then program crashed. So, I was not able to read the errors.
Then I tried to run it from the cmd, but this time I obtained a series of missing .dll and so the program has not even started.

		I had already tried the Release version before. But the problems are equal:
-compiling with visual studio the program crashed
-runnung in the cmd I had .dll problems.
Using CMake I put CPU_ONLY and I disabled USE_CUDNN.

		I am sorry for the error, and thanks for the feed-back. Then, we will need to wait until we can find a machine without CUDA on it. We can't do anything right now as we do not have this kind of hardware to replicate the issue. I will keep you posted.
The second solution is if you can compile Caffe for your Windows machine by yourselves, and then just indicate OpenPose where that Caffe is. The problem is Caffe not running for CPU_ONLY Windows machines.

		Hi, we have just finally tried it in a non-Nvidia machine, and everything worked fine with no errors.
Thus, the fix has been added to official OpenPose (download the latest OpenPose + follow CPU instructions).
If you are still having issues, they are not an OpenPose bug anymore, but rather an installation or Visual Studio issue. Some hints (also available in the doc):

Remove your OpenPose folder and re-download it completely.
Run net_resolution -1x80 to debug that the issue is not a RAM out of memory error.
Copy all DLLs from 3rdparty/caffe/.dll and 3rdparty/opencv/.dll to the same folder where OpenPoseDemo.exe is located.

If you are still having issues:

Post all your system hardware configuration (when you click in creating a new github issue you will see the template).
Add screenshots of the error itself.

Thanks for your debugging help!

		With the next OpenPose version that should include many new interesting features. It should be released before June ends.
Binaries for 1.3.0 would never work, as that CPU version of OpenPose uses a Caffe that requires CUDA.
But you can always compile the latest code from GitHub yourself if you have (wanna download) Visual Studio.
