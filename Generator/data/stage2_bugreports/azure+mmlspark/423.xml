Sometimes, when I have only 1 feature, the .fit() process fails with a bug.
However, if I combine 2 or more such bugged features, the .fit() process won't fail.
Here is the beginning of the error message when it fails.
Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o1063.fit.
: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 2 in stage 154.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 2.3 in stage 154.0 (TID 791, 10.231.246.65, executor 3): java.util.NoSuchElementException: key not found: 3

 Sorry about the issues you are having.  I think this is a different issue which has been fixed:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark/pull/399&gt;#399&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please also see:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark/issues/406&gt;#406&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and related issue:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark/issues/397&gt;#397&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

However, the fix was after the 0.14 release, it should be in 0.15.  You can use the latest build from master instead, eg:
--packages
com.microsoft.ml.spark:mmlspark_2.11:0.14.dev13+1.g58a2027c
and --repositories
&lt;denchmark-link:https://mmlspark.azureedge.net/maven&gt;https://mmlspark.azureedge.net/maven&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
