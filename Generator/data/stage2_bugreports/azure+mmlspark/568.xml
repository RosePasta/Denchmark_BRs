	<summary>LightGBMClassifier: for multiclass objective, wrong probability and prediction</summary>
	<description>
Training a LightGBMClassifier with multiclass objective,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;lgbm = LightGBMClassifier(objective='multiclass')
model = lgbm.fit(train)
scoredData = model.transform(test)


scoredData (raw and probability) looks like,
rawPrediction=DenseVector([-1.4917, -1.4697, -1.5847, -1.8326, -1.7148]),
probability=DenseVector([0.1837, 0.8163, -1.5847, -1.8326, -1.7148])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

probability is still calculated as binary classification.
Maybe prediction column is also wrong because of above.
