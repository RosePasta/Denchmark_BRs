 sorry, we don't support macOS with this release:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark/issues/290&gt;#290&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Although we should support it with next one as we have merged in the changes to support it to LightGBM repo:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/commit/414bb609c0d8c97091627a77ab49a1647825f1a9&gt;microsoft/LightGBM@414bb60&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
