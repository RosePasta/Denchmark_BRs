	<summary>Error Moving Images Within the Container</summary>
	<description>
The following error was received from within my dataset directory in the Coco Annotator UI: "No images found in directory." This error occurred after moving a temporary image folder into the dataset directory from within the container on a Ubuntu system.
The following command was used in the interactive shell:
$ sudo mv /data/datasets/temp/some_image_folder /data/datasets/SomeDataset/
A shell running the annotator_flask container shows that the directory does contain the images moved, but does not reflect in the Coco Annotator UI.

		Strange, once &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator/issues/101&gt;#101&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is completed you can use the rescan function.
