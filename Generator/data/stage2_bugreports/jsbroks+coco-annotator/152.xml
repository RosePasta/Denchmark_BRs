	<summary>Slow loading of large datasets</summary>
	<description>
When a dataset of roughly 26000 images was created, annotator took ~5 seconds to load a single image (saying 'loading annotations').
Browser:
Firefox 65.0.1 (64-bit), Ubuntu 18.04
Coco annotator docker image version 0.8.0.
Dataset info:
26000 images of resolution 270x320 pixels

		Causes is from getting &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator/blob/181caecaeffc9dc80ce611ca0b7636062f4bc784/app/api/annotator.py#L130&gt;next a previous&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Does anyone know a better way to do this?

 Could you check the latest build to see if the issue is fixed. I don't have a 26k dataset to test this on.

		Hi,
sorry for the long delay, I have pulled newest image from dockerhub, the loading is now fine, but thumbnails are not shown, is this a feature or shall I fire another issue?
