	<summary>Wrong path recorded for images</summary>
	<description>
In the lastest revision, the path property uses an old directory (/data) that doesn't exist anymore. E.g.:
{
  "id":1898,
  "path": "/data/datasets/obj1_day6_nov22/rgb105.jpg",
  "dataset_id": 19,
  "width": 1920,
  "height": 1080,
  "file_name": "rgb105.jpg",
  "annotated": true,
  "metadata": {}
}

		The docker file now mounts the /datasets/ directory to /datasets/ inside the docker container. This means all previous datasets before this fix will break since the image path no longer points to the proper location.
To fix this, move all your old datasets into a folder called '/data/datasets' and add the following line inside the docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml under services.flask.volumes:
services:
  flask:
    volumes:
    - './data/datasets:/data/datasets'
This will mount the older datasets back to the proper path name as they are stored in the database.
