	<summary>Missing annotation info when 'Download COCO' functionality is used</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
When I want to download all COCO json from a dataset, the annotation data is not included, any data or just some annotations. That happen in my local version as well.

		Sorry, maybe is that, I'm not familiar with Docker, I did again the installation erasing the containers, I also tried the update commands in the wiki, but it still not working for me, in your online test annotator it works.

		Every time I tag, a docker image called stable is built. Every time I make a commit, the latest tag is built.
On &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L7&gt;line 7 in the docker-compose.yml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you want to switch it from  to  (at the end). Then..
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I think my problem was that I was doing the Production Build, not the Development Build. I did those changes and it works, Thank you!!

		I would just like to clarify, the latest is still a production build.

		Ok, I tried to say that I built the project with:
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
and it works.
The other command didn't update the image:
$ docker-compose up --build

		Did you try what I said above?
You need to do $ docker-compose pull to update the image.

Every time I tag, a docker image called stable is built. Every time I make a commit, the latest tag is built.
On line 7 in the docker-compose.yml you want to switch it from stable to latest (at the end). Then..
docker-compose pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
