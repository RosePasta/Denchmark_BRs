	<summary>Clicked delete image but nothing happens...</summary>

I clicked delete, and see the API call went through...
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;flask_1     | [2019-04-07 14:00:16 +0000] [163] [DEBUG] DELETE /api/image/106
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

but nothing in the UI happened.. I had a hunch so I changed images and then cycled back to where the image used to be.. and indeed it's gone.. but this should happen I think automatically.. move to the next image in the list instead of hanging.
System used : Mac OSX running off the docker production image.
