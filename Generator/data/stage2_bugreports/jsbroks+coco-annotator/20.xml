	<summary>Sometimes gets stuck "saving" during annotation</summary>
	<description>
Not sure why this happens, but occasionally while annotating an image, the tool gets stuck on "saving data ...", which may prevent it from saving the most recent annotations

		To add: this seems to happen from the autosave feature. I haven't seen it happening from the manual save feature

 If you experience this again, could you check the web console to see if any error messages are displayed?
