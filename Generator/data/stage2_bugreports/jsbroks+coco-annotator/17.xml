	<summary>Save button in api/annotate/ only sometimes works</summary>
	<description>
When you create a new annotation and then click "save", the indicator in the top right corner switches from "working" to "done!". When you click save, and then download the annotations, an empty instance is returned:
e.g: {"id":24,"image_id":5,"category_id":1,"segmentation":[],"area":0,"bbox":[0,0,0,0],"iscrowd":false,"width":799,"height":533,"color":"#c110d4","metadata":{}}
But if you refresh the image after saving, and then save again, it will return the correct annotation.
