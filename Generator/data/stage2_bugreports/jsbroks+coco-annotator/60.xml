	<summary>"Undo last action" operation for brush, wand, and polygon</summary>

Only Eraser is capable of fixing the incorrect action, so undo operation for brush, wand, and polygon is necessary

		All options have the ability to undo the last action. But the tool icon does not seem to be working. If you us the hotkey ctrl+z does it undo your last action?

		Due to author inactivity, I will be closing this issue. A fix for the undo icon has been committed.

		I have this issue occasionally but I can't reproduce it. When this happens I also can't disable the tool I'm using by pressing ESC, and sometimes the lines of the polygon tool stays in the screen, even though I start a new polygon.
There's no errors neither in the server nor in the browser.
I fix the problem by reloading the page.
