	<summary>Saving current annotations should not reset the tool being used</summary>
	<description>
When the "save" button is clicked (or ctrl+s is used), the tool currently resets from whatever it previously was to the default "pointer".
This is a bit of an inconvenience for example when you've finished annotating one object in the image, and want to save the intermediate result. If you want to continue annotating the image, you need to re-enable the wand or polygon tool

		Edit: This seems to come from using the Ctrl+s macro, and not clicking the save on the left-hand side

		Not exactly sure what was causing this issue.
I applied a quick fix that sets the active tool at the end of the save function to the one before. If this causes issues in later updates, this issue can be revisited.
