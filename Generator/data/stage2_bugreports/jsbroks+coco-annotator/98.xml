	<summary>occasionally, loading an image displays none of its annotations</summary>
	<description>
Occasionally, (maybe 5-10% of the time) when navigating to the next or previous image in a dataset, the image loads with no annotations shown in the paperjs window.
This seems like a client-side race condition; no errors occur in the browser console, and it can always be resolved by refreshing the page.
Clicking Hide All/Show All has no effect on the page when it happens to load in this state.
I have not yet determined root cause..

		For sure a client race.
Ethier the data is getting loaded so fast the annotations are behind the image or the data loads to fast before the papers instance is initialized

		Found the cases. If you do any mousewheel action well the image is loading it causes the annotations to fail.
