3.7
NumPy version:
1.17

Describe the current behavior
Forward pass implementation of LSTM is incorrect
Describe the expected behavior
Code is currently as below. This forget and update gate biases have typos
        # compute the input to the gate functions at timestep t
        _Go = Zt @ Wo + bo
        _Gf = Zt @ Wf + bo
        _Gu = Zt @ Wu + bo
        _Gc = Zt @ Wc + bc
