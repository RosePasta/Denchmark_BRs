		We should have tests that check that examples at least don't crash.  See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/probmods/webppl/blob/dev/tests/test-examples.js&gt;webPPL's example test&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 while going through the examples, I added a few minor fixes so they all run (mostly syntax errors and tensor broadcasting). is it safe to open a PR or will this cause conflicts with what you're working on?
