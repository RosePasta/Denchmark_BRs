Is pyro current version compatible with pytorch 1.2 ?
I have pytorch 1.2 and pyro. Not sure why but for a very simple linear NN model notebook is crashing when I define model function and guide function.
The NN model has only 2 layers with not many parameters. RAM has lot of free space too (in 10+ GBs. So I suspect this may be due to version compatibility issue. Please advise.

		Yes Pyro is currently compatible with PyTorch 1.2. Can you try to paste a simple-to-reproduce example? I sometimes see segfaults due to low-level PyTorch bugs. Pyro tends to exercise uncommonly used parts of PyTorch that tend to be buggier than vanilla nn code.

		Please close this issue. I was using an old example book which had old pytorch functions which were not relevant. However I saw another issue with Pyro sandbox examples.

with torch.no_grad(): guide_trace = poutine.trace(guide).get_trace(features_train, counts_train) hmm = poutine.replay(model_2, guide_trace)(features_train, counts_train) init_dist = hmm.filter(guide_trace.nodes["log_rates"]["value"])
I got this error:-
AttributeError: 'GaussianHMM' object has no attribute 'filter'
Sorry for bad formatting. Couldn't fix it quickly..
Any suggestions on how to forecast? Can you also refer examples for forecast that can be applicable in all cases..?
