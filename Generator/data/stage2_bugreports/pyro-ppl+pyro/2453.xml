	<summary>RTD build fails for `latest` branch</summary>
	<description>
Couple of days ago I checked it was all OK, but now it seems whole sections of the documentation under latesthave effectively been "emptied", with nothing but a list in them (no content):
&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/inference_algos.html#importance&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/inference_algos.html#importance&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/distributions.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/distributions.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/parameters.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/parameters.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/nn.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/nn.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/optimization.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/optimization.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/poutine.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/poutine.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/ops.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/ops.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/contrib.autoname.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/contrib.autoname.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/contrib.bnn.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/contrib.bnn.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/contrib.examples.html&gt;http://docs.pyro.ai/en/latest/contrib.examples.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

etc etc (non-contributed tutorials &amp; examples seem OK)
Docs under stable seem to be OK.

 can you recommend a good debugging workflow for docs building? They build for me locally, so it must be a RTD mismatch.
I suspect the docs are failing because I've been adding non-ascii characters to docstrings lately, all in pyro.contrib.epidemiology.

		Strangely, the links to the dev branch that latest should point to seem to work fine. e.g.

http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/inference_algos.html#importance
http://docs.pyro.ai/en/dev/distributions.html

This seems to me to be some readthedocs issue rather than a build issue.

 the torch endpoint seems to have changed:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Looking in links: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.4.0+cpu (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2, 0.3.1, 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.1.post2, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.4.0, 1.5.0)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==1.4.0+cpu
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Can we build against 1.5 (as I assume you're doing locally)? The &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/&gt;website&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 only lists up to 1.2 for cpu wheels.
[edit]

Strangely, the links to the dev branch that latest should point to seem to work fine.

yeah i checked the two branches and they are the same on rtd as well. not sure what's going on if there's some weird caching going on; i kicked off a new build.
[edit2]
Fixed
Re: good debugging workflow - RTD installs and builds all packages from scratch. If there's a mismatch between your local env and rtd it's usually because one of the packages has changed.
