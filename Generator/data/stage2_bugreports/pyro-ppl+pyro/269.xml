	<summary>lift to memoize samples</summary>
	<description>
taken from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/266&gt;#266&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 :
lift doesn't quite work properly when param is called with the same name twice in a stochastic function. This is not allowed for sample but is currently fine to do with param, since the second call just retrieves the same value from the parameter store.
