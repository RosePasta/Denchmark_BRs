	<summary>Pyro docs no longer show up on Google</summary>
	<description>
(sorry to use github for a website issue but imho this a serious).
When I Google for &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.google.com/search?q=pyro+discretehmm&gt;"pyro discretehmm"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, all I see is examples and blog posts, and results pointing to rtd. When I narrow to &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.google.com/search?q=docs.pyro.ai+discretehmm&gt;"docs.pyro.ai discretehmm"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I do see links to rtd but they point to module source code rather than the actual docs.
Does anyone have an idea why docs seem broken? Do we have a norobots.txt or prohibited link on our rtd pages?

		Maybe this is just google autocorrecting "discretehmm" to "discrete hmm" which doesn't appear on the desired page.
