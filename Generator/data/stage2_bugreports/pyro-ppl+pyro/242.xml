	<summary>Make docs not working on travis</summary>
	<description>
The sphinx doc build test is currently disabled after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/212&gt;#212&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, because make docs was failing on travis due to changed references in one of our .rst files (it was passing locally as reported by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/martinjankowiak&gt;@martinjankowiak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). This needs to be fixed so that we can run the tests on all PRs before they get merged into dev.
