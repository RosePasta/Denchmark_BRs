	<summary>Vectorized loss in KL_QP and global variables</summary>
	<description>
I wrote a quick Bayesian logistic regression example for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ChunyuanLI&gt;@ChunyuanLI&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and realized that the vectorized elbo is broken when some sample statements aren't batched, which happens when you have global variables like the weights in logistic regression.  I added a tiny fix in that branch to make it run (just add a few  calls), but rather than pushing that immediately I would prefer to look for a more permanent solution for Rao-Blackwellization sooner rather than later or else scrap it for now - doing it this way has caused a lot of other problems.

		could you add a minimal example of where the problem arises?
