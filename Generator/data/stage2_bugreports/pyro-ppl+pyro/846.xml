	<summary>Errors when combining iarange + discrete enumeration</summary>
	<description>
This issue tracks progress of combining enumeration &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/742&gt;#742&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and nested  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/780&gt;#780&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Currently  gives incorrect results when enumerating any , even in SS-VAE (as discovered by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rohitsingh0812&gt;@rohitsingh0812&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).

		This was mostly fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/828&gt;#828&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. What remains is to fix broadcasting issues due to global variables that appear in s.
