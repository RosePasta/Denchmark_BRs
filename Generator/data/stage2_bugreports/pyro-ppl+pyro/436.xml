	<summary>New Bernoulli parameterization lead to subtle bug in AIR model</summary>
	<description>
When I merged &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/416&gt;#416&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 into a local branch it broke the AIR example.
Here's a simplified instance of the problem:
import torch
from torch.autograd import Variable
from pyro.distributions import Bernoulli
from torch.nn.functional import sigmoid

p = Variable(torch.Tensor([0]), requires_grad=True)
b = Bernoulli(sigmoid(p) * 0.0)
log_pdf = b.batch_log_pdf(Variable(torch.Tensor([0])))
log_pdf.sum().backward()
print(p.grad)
Prior to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/416&gt;#416&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 this returned a  of zero as expected, but it now returns :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pyro$ git rev-parse --short HEAD
71bca18
pyro$ python3 bern.py 
Variable containing:
-0
[torch.FloatTensor of size 1]

pyro$ git rev-parse --short HEAD
a85525a
pyro$ python3 bern.py 
Variable containing:
nan
[torch.FloatTensor of size 1]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I suspect that the problem is that converting between probabilities and log odds introduces an intemediate -inf, which messes up autograd.
I may be able to adjust the model to work around this, but either way, should this be considered a bug? (It seems like it could trip other people up, and chasing down the source of the nans is tricky.)

		Thanks for the reproducible example, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/null-a&gt;@null-a&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! I'll try to get a fix in today, failing which, it may be better to revert the logit PR instead. Will keep you posted.

 No problem, thanks for taking a look!
