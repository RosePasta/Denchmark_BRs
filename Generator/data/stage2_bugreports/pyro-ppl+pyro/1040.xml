		thanks for looking into this!
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; make notebook img=pyro-cpu-dev-3.6
Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=becb10939593b64b4988cb051f617bc0b1a20f539237e173
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

that URL does not work even though the build succeeds
