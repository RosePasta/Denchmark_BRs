	<summary>Predictive class fails for non-scalar sites</summary>
	<description>
I usually use raw poutines to for prediction:
vectorize = pyro.plate("_vectorize", num_samples, dim=-2)
trace = poutine.trace(vectorize(guide)).get_trace()
samples = poutine.replay(vectorize(model), trace)()
When instead I try the new Predictive class, this fails on models with nontrivial plate structure:
predictive = Predictive(model, guide=guide, return_sites=["x", "y"],
                        num_samples=num_samples, parallel=True)
samples = predictive.get_samples()
I believe this is due to reshaping of posterior samples without regard to their event shape. I don't know why _predictive() even needs to reshape samples.
I have added a failing test in this branch. Feel free to take over the branch and create a PR:

 let me know if you need more failing examples, this came up in an uber internal model.

 Sure, more failing examples would be helpful! I'll also test some related cases which I can think about.
