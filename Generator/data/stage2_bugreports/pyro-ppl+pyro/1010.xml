	<summary>Docker build with Pyro dev, PyTorch master, and Python 2.7 fails</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to build a Docker image from our dockerfile using make build pyro_branch=dev pytorch_branch=master python_version=2.7 and got the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Step 22/25 : RUN conda install -y python=${python_version} &amp;&amp;     conda install -y jupyter matplotlib
 ---&gt; Running in d334a6741e9d
Solving environment: ...working... failed

UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found to be in conflict:
  - chardet -&gt; python[version='&gt;=3.6,&lt;3.7.0a0']
  - python=2.7
Use "conda info &lt;package&gt;" to see the dependencies for each package.

The command '/bin/sh -c conda install -y python=${python_version} &amp;&amp;     conda install -y jupyter matplotlib' returned a non-zero code: 1
Makefile:40: recipe for target 'build' failed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I think the scripts possibly need updating to include mkl-devel but this looks unrelated. Will investigate and push out a fix.
