	<description>
PyTorch master now supports scalars. Pyro currently breaks with PyTorch master.

		I think this works now. We don't use scalars in all our examples, but many test and examples already use scalars.

 Do you know whether your gp module supports scalars? I'm starting to use it and I noticed that your tutorial still uses 1-dimensional tensors like  rather than newer scalars like .

 I think that it should be fine. We use  with  and  to multiply with the final computation of covariance matrix. At some place we do  but the behavior of this method is the same for both scalar and non-scalar tensor. I will fix if you detect any error related to scalar tensors.
