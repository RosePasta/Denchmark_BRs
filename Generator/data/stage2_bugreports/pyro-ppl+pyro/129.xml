	<summary>Blocking execution vs side effects in the poutine stack</summary>
	<description>
Currently the downward blocking mechanism in the poutine stack () blocks all computation in the stack below a Poutine that decides to block at a site.  For example, in  ( &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/121&gt;#121&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) all poutines below  are ignored at  sites in the model.
However, consider a model where lift appears inside a map_data.  Then the ScalePoutine installed at map_data will not be applied at lift, and the scorer will not be scaled correctly in inference algorithms.
One solution to this is to do something like what's happening in map_data now, where there's a separate done flag that prevents the function at the site from being called multiple times, but the entire poutine stack is still applied at each site so that e.g. scale information is propagated correctly.
