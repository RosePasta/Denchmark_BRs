	<summary>scipy imresize is deprecated</summary>
	<description>
imresize is used in air example, but it is deprecated now. We need to replace it by something else to make tests pass.
More context about this issue:  is used in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/edwardlib/observations&gt;observations&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but this library is deprecated now in favour of tensorflow &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets&gt;datasets&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. But multi-mnist is not available in tensorflow's datasets yet. So I'm not sure what is a good solution for this issue.

		The problem is with the observations library (that uses this function) which is not being maintained anymore. I think we need to remove dependency on observations.

The &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.2.0/reference/generated/scipy.misc.imresize.html&gt;docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 suggest using  inplace of . This requires  which AIR already has as a dependency.
