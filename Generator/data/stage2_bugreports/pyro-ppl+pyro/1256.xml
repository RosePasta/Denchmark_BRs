	<summary>[bug] Bug in MADE implementation used for IAF</summary>
	<description>
I think I've found a bug in the MADE code in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uber/pyro/blob/dev/pyro/nn/auto_reg_nn.py#L72&gt;this part of the code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The expression:
torch.multinomial(torch.tensor(input_dim - 1).fill_(1.).float(), num_samples=hidden_dim, replacement=True)
always returns a vector of zeros for me (not sure why, perhaps because of in-place operations?), whereas it works as it ought if I change it to,
torch.multinomial(torch.ones(input_dim - 1), num_samples=hidden_dim, replacement=True)
outputting a random vector of random integers on 0:(input_dim-1).
I'm using the nightly build of Pytorch from 7/5/2018, and Python 3.6.5 on Ubuntu

		I'm reworking the Pyro IAF code for my own experiments and adding a lot of features - would this be welcomed if I submitted it as a pull request?
I'm adding:

using multi-layer MADEs with skip connections
conditional MADEs for conditional densities
explicitly calculating the IAF inverse
multiple steps of normalizing flow
MAF and NAF

		That would be great!

that would be awesome. in doing so you might consider doing the following:


open up an issue to highlight/discuss some of the design choices you're making. it's possible
that some group discussion and targeted comments could improve upon your initial design


when you're ready to submit code, submit a series of PRs (each adding one or two discrete
new features) instead of one giant PR. note that doing 1) before 2) may help make the code review
process smoother

		Oh right, that should have been torch.Tensor(input_dim - 1) rather than torch.tensor(input_dim - 1). The former creates an empty tensor of shape (input_dim-1,) whereas the latter creates a scalar LongTensor of shape () filled with the value input_dim - 1.

 - Now that the master task is being tracked in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/1260&gt;#1260&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, can we close this issue, or does the bug still exist?

 yes, I'll close this issue now! That bug was fixed in the rewrite of the MADE class
