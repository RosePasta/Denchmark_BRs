	<summary>bad function in examples</summary>
	<description>
This issue is on &lt;denchmark-link:http://pyro.ai/examples/intro_part_ii.html&gt;http://pyro.ai/examples/intro_part_ii.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so hopefully this is the right place for an issue.
# equivalent to pyro.condition(scale, data={"measurement": Variable(torch.ones(1))})
def scale_obs(guess):
    z = pyro.sample("weight", dist.normal, guess, Variable(torch.ones(1)))
     # here we attach an observation measurement == 1
    return pyro.sample("measurement", dist.normal, weight, Variable(torch.ones(1)),
                       obs=Variable(torch.Tensor([0.1])))

weight is not defined, I'm guessing that z should be weight

Yep, this is correct, I'll fix it.

		That section also contains a couple of mixed up numbers, where the observed measurement is stated to be 0.1 in the main text, while the comments in the code claim measurement==1, with the actual code agreeing with the former. One code example is the snipped tbenst posted about the z/weight issue.
