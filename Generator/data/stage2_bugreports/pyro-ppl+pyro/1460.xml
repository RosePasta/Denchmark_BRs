	<summary>Fix TraceEnum_ELBO.compute_marginals(), .sample_posterior()</summary>
	<description>
Currently TraceEnum_ELBO.compute_marginals(), and .sample_posterior() incorrectly handle iaranges. The issue is in contract_to_tensor, where information is not correctly passed across local variables that are coupled by a global variable. The error can be detected in discrepancy between naive_ubersum() and ubersum().
Currently working: when enumerated variables are either all local or all global
Currently failing: when there is communication between global and local enumerated variables.
