	<summary>Broadcasting issue with Gaussian Process</summary>
	<description>
I was trying to fit some 2D data with Gaussian Process.
During the training at multivariate normal, calculating log prob fails as broadcast doesn't work.
adding unsqueeze followed by expand_as and diag seems to fix the issue.
Code to reproduced
#%%
import torch
import pyro
from pyro.contrib.gp.kernels import RBF
from pyro.contrib.gp.models import GPRegression
import pyro.distributions as dist
from pyro.infer import SVI
from pyro.optim import Adam
from pyro.util import ng_ones, ng_zeros

pyro.set_rng_seed(0)

N = [20, 500]
X = dist.Uniform(ng_zeros(N), ng_ones(N)*5).sample()
y = 0.5 * torch.sin(3*X) + dist.Normal(ng_zeros(N), ng_ones(N)*0.5).sample()

kernel = RBF(input_dim=500, variance=torch.Tensor([10]), lengthscale=torch.Tensor([10]))
gpr = GPRegression(X, y, kernel, noise=torch.Tensor([1]))


optim = Adam({"lr": 0.001})
svi = SVI(gpr.model, gpr.guide, optim, loss="ELBO")
losses = []
num_steps = 1000
for i in range(num_steps):
    losses.append(svi.step())

		Hi, what version of Pyro and PyTorch are you using?

 Right now, GP does not support multidimensional output yet. I intend to implement it this weekend (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/issues/832&gt;#832&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) but it seems that you already solve this problem. Would you mind making a pull request for it? :)

master, dev branch of pytorch and pyro!
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fehiepsi&gt;@fehiepsi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I made a PR and tested it but I can't seems to get the pyro test system working so it would be nice if you can let me know whether it passes those tests (those tests fails even on dev branch for some reason)

		@SINDHUKUMARIP this code snippet is now outdated and  and  no longer exist in Pyro 0.2.1.  Please see the GP tutorial instead for up-to-date examples of GP usage: &lt;denchmark-link:http://pyro.ai/examples/gp.html&gt;http://pyro.ai/examples/gp.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
