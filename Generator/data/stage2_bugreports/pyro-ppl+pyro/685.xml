	<summary>MultivariateNormal.batch_log_pdf() has incorrect gradient</summary>
	<description>
It appears that gradient wrt the scale_tril argument is incorrect.
The only way I've been able to conclusively diagnose this is by checking the continuity equation on samples, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/8c2d35c/test/test_distributions.py#L1176&gt;as is done in PyTorch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We should probably have continuity equation checks as part of the tests. I've also hand-implemented a  in the  branch; this should have correct gradients and be usable for testing as a reference implementation.
This also shows up in poorly-fit distributions in SVI. Sorry I do not have a reproducible test case.

		What is the extent of the error here? Still usable or shall I hold off using it in my models? Btw if I can contribute in any way I'd be happy to.

		 is incorrect and unusable. We will be dropping  support from  this week as we refactor to use PyTorch distributions in Pyro. Useful parts of Pyro's MultivariateNormal distribution will be moved upstream. If you'd like to help, I suggest contributing to the PyTorch implementation in progress at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/probtorch/pytorch/pull/52&gt;probtorch/pytorch#52&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
