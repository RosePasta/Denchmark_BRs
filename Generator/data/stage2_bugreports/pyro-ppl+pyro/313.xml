	<summary>subsample needs to implement log_pdf or change batch_log_pdf return type</summary>
	<description>
this is a followup to the change made in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/310&gt;#310&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. To work with both CUDA and CPU,  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uber/pyro/commit/51012d8d32866784da0a55d15934239372ccaee6#diff-28bc2118000453a3374ed12e41bb83aaL145&gt;returns a scalar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but if you use  in inference you will get an error because it is using 's  on the output of .
 should either override the default  or  should return a  of zeros.  Not sure how the latter plays with CUDA but perhaps &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fritzo&gt;@fritzo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can look into it from your testing of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/310&gt;#310&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?

		I agree with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jpchen&gt;@jpchen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 that the fix is to implement a simple 
def log_pdf(self, x):
    return 0.0
