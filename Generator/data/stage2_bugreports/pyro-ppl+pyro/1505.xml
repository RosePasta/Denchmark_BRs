	<summary>HMC gives non deterministic results with parallel chaining</summary>
	<description>
Even though the ParallelSampler yields the same set of traces (each worker gives deterministic results), the order in which the traces are consumed might be different, which gives different results when we use TracePredictive.
One way to get deterministic results from HMC/NUTS with num_chains &gt; 1 would be to store intermediate results, and yield results from each of the workers in a round-robin fashion.
