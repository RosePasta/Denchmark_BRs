	<summary>Tests giving incorrect results on CUDA</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to fix tests that don't work with CUDA..e.g. by adjusting precision, changing functions that do not have CUDA implementations, etc.
Following is a working list of tests that are giving incorrect results, and which seem to have deeper issues:

 #1057 tests/contrib/gp/test_models.py::test_inference - Results are too inaccurate. cc.@fehiepsi
