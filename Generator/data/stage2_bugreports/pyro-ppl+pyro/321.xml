	<summary>Incorrect result from Delta's batch_log_pdf</summary>
	<description>
It looks like there may be a bug in Delta's batch_log_pdf method. When the value we're computing the log prob of doesn't match the parameter I expect batch_log_pdf to return -inf but it doesn't. For example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = Variable(torch.Tensor([[1.0]]))
y = Variable(torch.Tensor([[2.0]]))

# This is OK, it returns zero as expected:
print(Delta(x).batch_log_pdf(x))

# Here I expect -inf, but get 2.5500e+08
print(Delta(x).batch_log_pdf(y))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

log_pdf works as expected.
(This isn't high priority for me.)
