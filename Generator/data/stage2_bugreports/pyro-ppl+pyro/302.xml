	<summary>Change Cauchy distribution sampling behavior</summary>
	<description>
Currently, the distribution fills using the shape of mu and gamma but uses the first value of both to fill the entire tensor. This runs counter to what other distributions do (pointwise using the values to fill up the tensor).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jpchen&gt;@jpchen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: can we use the scipy implementation instead (like we are doing for half cauchy)?
code snippet:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        sample.data.cauchy_(mu_val.data[0], gamma_val.data[0])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		good catch, does the scipy version handle vectorized mus? i think our tests were only for size 1 tensors so maybe this wasnt tested
note this was actually changed from scipy to use pytorch's implementation, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/233&gt;#233&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It does that for the half cauchy; so my guess is that it would correctly handle this case too.

note this was actually changed from scipy to use pytorch's implementation, see #233

The pytorch version seems rather restrictive, and this strange behavior will cause silent bugs. There would be no easy way to fill in a 2x3 matrix with different param values per row for instance. If we are using this, then we should throw a strong warning when the uses supplies anything other than a 1 dimensional parameter value (which kind of defeats the whole point of using the tensor distribution library :) ).
