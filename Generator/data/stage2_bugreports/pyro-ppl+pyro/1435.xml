	<summary>[bug] `--jit` option fails for HMM example</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using the --jit option for the examples/hmm.py example fails with the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;      741 Loading data
      784 ----------------------------------------
      784 Training model_1 on 229 sequences
      791 Step	Loss
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".../pyro/examples/hmm.py", line 294, in &lt;module&gt;
    main(args)
  File ".../hmm.py", line 256, in main
    loss = svi.step(sequences, lengths, args, batch_size=args.batch_size)
  File "...\pyro\infer\svi.py", line 96, in step
    loss = self.loss_and_grads(self.model, self.guide, *args, **kwargs)
  File "...\pyro\infer\traceenum_elbo.py", line 431, in loss_and_grads
    differentiable_loss = self._differentiable_loss(*args)
  File "...\pyro\ops\jit.py", line 56, in __call__
    ret = self.compiled(param_list, *args, **kwargs)
RuntimeError: Only tuples, lists and Variables supported as JIT inputs, but got Namespace
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I believe this is because the command line arguments args are passed as a parameter of type Namespace, which is not supported by the JIT.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Environment&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS and python version: Windows 10, Python 3.6
PyTorch version: 0.4.0
Pyro version: 0.2.1

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Code Snippet&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Simply run examples/hmm.py with option --jit.

		there is no jit support implemented in 0.2.1 and pytorch 0.4.0. see instructions to install the pre-release versions &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/uber/pyro/pull/1436&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. note that the pytorch jit is not yet stable and ongoing active development so things may change/break up to the release.

 I am using the dev branch, sorry for being unclear.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/eb8680&gt;@eb8680&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Will try, thanks for the suggestion!

		Thanks for the bug report, and you are right that args is the problematic bit when we try to JIT the svi.step call.

 - Reopening this, as this is an issue with the  for the reason that &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ahmadsalim&gt;@ahmadsalim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned.

		I think we just need to pass the args object as a kwarg rather than a positional arg:
- loss = svi.step(sequences, lengths, args, batch_size=args.batch_size)
+ loss = svi.step(sequences, lengths, args=args, batch_size=args.batch_size)
I'll send a PR shortly.

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ahmadsalim&gt;@ahmadsalim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: This should work on the pytorch-1.0 branch now.

		I'm still seeing an error after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/1445&gt;#1445&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but it's a different error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ValueError: Expected all enumerated sample sites to share a common poutine.scale, but found 11 different scales.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It is unclear whether that's due to a bug in PyTorch or Pyro.
