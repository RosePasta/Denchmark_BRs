	<summary>ApplicationSuspensionResourceTest triggers JVM OoM</summary>
	<description>
This test was the root cause of the build instability on Travis-CI (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/issues/3568&gt;#3568&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).  eats up all memory on the host and gets killed by the kernel during the second execution of the  initializer. The unit test is currently disabled to keep the build from failing.
