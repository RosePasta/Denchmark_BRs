During stage 0 to stage 5. I got the message which I am not sure if it leads to the wrong results.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18534928/92445020-4aec6580-f1e6-11ea-9b0d-c031f1d62870.PNG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Is there anybody who knows how to fix this error? Thanks in advance!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/happyjin&gt;@happyjin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - Thats a warning message.. with reference to the 2nd screenshot I believe the pertubed data prep folder must be prepared having around 496332 utterances.
with reference to the 1st screenshot, Attaching any log file present in the decode_train_dev_decode_lm/log would help to fix the error.
