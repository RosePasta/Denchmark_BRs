	<summary>Libritts run.sh error</summary>
	<description>
I'm getting this error when I try to run run.sh in the libritts tts1 directory:
utils/validate_data_dir.sh: text contains 1 lines with non-printable characters
I don't know where I could be getting this error from.  I haven't made any modifications to anything inside of libritts.

		I encountered the same problem, which is recently introduced in Kaldi.
I'll report it to Kaldi people, but you can avoid this by directly editing validate_data_dir.sh as follows for now:
non_print=true

		Should we fix kaldi version? I think the updating of Kaldi is unnecessary for us.
