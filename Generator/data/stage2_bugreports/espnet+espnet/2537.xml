	<summary>The pre-trained model of conformer in librispeech egs can't be correctly uncompressed.</summary>
	<description>
Hi all,
I try to download the pre-trained conformer model from the &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GFaqEKsI6M_dBbxHD7s84J3yi5WGeNNC?usp=sharing&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/librispeech/asr1/RESULTS.md&gt;page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. But the downloaded file can't be uncompressed correctly.
The error logs are:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; tar zxvf model.tar.gz
 conf/tuning/conformer/train_pytorch_conformer_large.yaml
 conf/decode.yaml
 data/train_960/cmvn.ark
 exp/train_960_pytorch_train_pytorch_conformer_large_specaug/results/model.val5.avg.best
 gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--format violated
 tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
 tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
 tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I'm the same, don't know how to solve it

Hi all, I have uploaded a new file called model.tar.gz. I have tested on my owner server. Would you mind testing it again? (The original file has been renamed to model_old.tar.gz)
