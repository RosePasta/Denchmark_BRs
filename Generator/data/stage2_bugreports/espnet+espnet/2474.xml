	<summary>No tools/activate_python.sh but called from egs/wsj/asr1/path.sh</summary>
	<description>
Hello!
In the latest release, the /tools/activate_python.sh script is called in the line 10 in egs/wsj/asr1/path.sh  but it is not in the tools folder:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$MAIN_ROOT/tools/chainer_ctc/ext/warp-ctc/build
. "${MAIN_ROOT}"/tools/activate_python.sh &amp;&amp; . "${MAIN_ROOT}"/tools/extra_path.sh
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, currently, I am using the previous approach.
Best, Yulia

		You must create it by yourself. See documentation.

Recently I updated some installation flows, so if you have already installled espnet and pull the latest repo, you may encounter such issue...
