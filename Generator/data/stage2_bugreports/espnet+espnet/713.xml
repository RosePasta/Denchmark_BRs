The issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/694&gt;#694&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was closed but the problem is still existing in the run.sh file of the tedlium/asr1 recipe.
I suggested a fix: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/694&gt;#694&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
