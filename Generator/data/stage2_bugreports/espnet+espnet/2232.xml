	<summary>bug: Expected object of backend CPU but got bacKend CUDA</summary>
	<description>
When I run the egs/voxforge/asr1/run_rnnt.sh with 4 GPU and train cofig of conf/tuning/transducer/train_transducer_both_init.yaml, I met the error of
RuntimeError: Expected object of backend CPU but got backend CUDA for sequence element 1 in sequence argument 1 in sequence argument at position #1 'tensors'.
The error occured beacuse of the code ey = torch.cat((eys, att_c),dim=1) in rnn_decoders.py.

		Hi,
I suppose you met the bug when report_cer=True or/and report_wer=True?

yes. do I need to set them as False? why?

		I was just guessing what was the reason for the bug :)
I'll fix that, you can set the options to False for now.

		I just tested CER/WER reporting with RNN-T att. and It seems I already fixed this bug when I unified search methods in my current PR. I'm closing this issue, the fix should be available next week I think!
