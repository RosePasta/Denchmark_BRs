	<summary>Tedlium 2: Pretrained transformer model not available</summary>
	<description>
The pretrained Transformer (large model + specaug + large LM) model files for Tedlium 2 are unavailable at the link in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/tedlium2/asr1/RESULTS.md&gt;RESULTS.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 file for Tedlium 2, as well as in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet#results-and-demo&gt;Results and Demo section of the README of this project&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (tedlium2.transformer.v1).
In both cases, the link is &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mgbiWabOSkh_oHJIDA-h7hekQ3W95Z_U&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mgbiWabOSkh_oHJIDA-h7hekQ3W95Z_U&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it leads to the 404 page of Google Drive.

		I think you are using recog_wav.sh file, you can replace it with your model if you have one.

		My issue is that I cannot access the pre-trained model and that this repository links to files that do not exist. I know how to train my own model.

, can you fix the link?
I also confirmed that the link is broken.
Also, it would be better to put it to my google drive so that I could manage to fix it by myself.

		sorry I do not have access to that model file and GPU servers anymore. I
wish someone can rerun this exp and upload it...

		If you can wait for 2 weeks, I will get back my GPU machine. I expect that I have downloaded the file there.

		I downloaded Librispeech pre trained model before &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/palle-k&gt;@palle-k&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I can share it with you if you don't mind

, this is very helpful!
And also to avoid this issue, it would be better to put the model under my Google drive.
Could you send me your email address to &lt;denchmark-link:mailto:shinjiw@ieee.org&gt;shinjiw@ieee.org&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? Then, I'll send you an invitation.

, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/palle-k&gt;@palle-k&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is asking about the Tedlium 2 model. Do you still have that?
