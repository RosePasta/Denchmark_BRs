	<summary>AMI Recipe for espnet2 config question</summary>
	<description>
I see that for the espnet2 recipe for ami run.sh points to conf/decode_asr.yaml, but there is only a conf/decode.yaml. Is that the correct yaml file for the recipe or do I need to copy it from somewhere?
Thanks
Michael

		Yes,  (but it's a symlink pointing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/ami/asr1/conf/tuning/decode_transformer.yaml&gt;https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/ami/asr1/conf/tuning/decode_transformer.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
We'll fix it soon.
Thanks, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/picheny-nyu&gt;@picheny-nyu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
