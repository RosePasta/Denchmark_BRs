	<summary>Unable to decode with Word RNNLM when &amp;lt;space&amp;gt; is not in corpus</summary>
	<description>
I have trained a SentencePiece BPE token based E2E system and a word-based RNNLM.
While decoding, I get an error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/home/anuj/espnet/espnet/lm/pytorch_backend/extlm.py", line 116, in __init__
    self.space = subword_dict['&lt;space&gt;']
KeyError: '&lt;space&gt;'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is there any solution to this?
This is similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/1473&gt;#1473&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but the setup described in that issue was different.

		BPE token is not supported for word RNNLM.
Also, it is not easy to make some error handling for this condition and we just leave it as it is.
