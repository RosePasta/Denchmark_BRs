	<summary>How we can perform greedy decoding for RNN_T ?</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I trained an RNNT model using vivos recipe. I performed the decoding using beam search successfully now I'm trying to perform the decoding with greedy search I thought I could do that by setting beam-size parameter to 1:
# decoding parameters
batch: 0
beam-size: 1
search-type: default
score-norm: True
but I got this error:
File "/home/selma/espnet/espnet/asr/pytorch_backend/asr.py", line 1074, in recog
js[name], nbest_hyps, train_args.char_list
File "/home/selma/espnet/espnet/asr/asr_utils.py", line 828, in add_results_to_json
rec_text, rec_token, rec_tokenid, score = parse_hypothesis(hyp, char_list)
File "/home/selma/espnet/espnet/asr/asr_utils.py", line 796, in parse_hypothesis
tokenid_as_list = list(map(int, hyp["yseq"][1:]))
TypeError: string indices must be integers
So I would like to know how could I perform greedy decoding for my model.
Thanks in advance!

		I fixed this error by making these changes:

But I don't know if this is the best way to do it or not.

, could you check it?
I think the greedy decoding is important for the debugging purpose and we may include it as a test.

		Sorry, this is a silly mistake in beam_search_transducer.py (l.161) I introduced during a refactoring for CER/WER reporting. Decoding methods should return a list of hypotheses during inference.

 Greedy search should be covered in unit test though, I'll take a look later sorry.
