	<summary>Error when building docker</summary>
	<description>
When I building docker, I run espnet/docker/build.sh: sudo ./build.sh local 10.0, but I got this error:
. venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install cupy-cuda==6.0.0
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cupy-cuda==6.0.0 (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for cupy-cuda==6.0.0
Makefile:77: recipe for target 'cupy.done' failed
make: *** [cupy.done] Error 1
The command '/bin/sh -c if [ -z "$( nvcc -V )" ]; then         make KALDI=/kaldi CUPY_VERSION='';     else         sed -i '161s|install.py|install.py --no-cupy|' Makefile &amp;&amp;         sed -i '21s|nvidia-smi|nvcc|' Makefile &amp;&amp;         make KALDI=/kaldi CUDA_VERSION=${CUDA_VER};     fi' returned a non-zero code: 2
I have installed espnet with no error but I don't know why I got this Error by building docker.
Please help me and tell me how can I fix it.
Thank you

		Sorry I forgot to tell you that the problem is that --dlayers is no longer accepted in recipe run.sh. For this, you will need to write a new train_config file in conf folder and call it with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./run.sh --docker_gpu -1 --docker_egs chime4/asr1 --docker_folders /export/corpora4/CHiME4/CHiME3 --docker_user false --train_config conf/&lt;my_train_file&gt;.yaml --ngpu 0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

You can use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/chime4/asr1/conf/tuning/train_pytorch_transformer.yaml&gt;this file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as reference.

		Can't I directly use train_pytorch_transformer.yaml ?
If not then which part to edit?! Can kindly tell?!

		<comment id='10' author='wentaoxandry' date='2020-03-11T00:58:33Z'>
		train_pytorch_transformer.yaml is the default config file used for training: 


espnet/egs/chime4/asr1/conf/train.yaml


         Line 1
      in
      9e2bfc5






 ./tuning/train_pytorch_transformer.yaml 








espnet/egs/chime4/asr1/run.sh


         Line 23
      in
      9e2bfc5






 train_config=conf/train.yaml 





so you do not need to any additional modification.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./run.sh --docker_gpu -1 --docker_egs chime4/asr1 --docker_folders /export/corpora4/CHiME4/CHiME3 --docker_user false  --ngpu 0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In case that you want to train your self defined model, then you will need to prepare a new yaml file.

		Okay understood!
But I am getting find: '/export/corpora4/CHiME4/CHiME3/data/WSJ0': No such file or directory
Where is: /export/.... ?

		well, that depends on your system. For CHiME 4, you will need to download the data from the official page: &lt;denchmark-link:http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/chime_challenge/CHiME3/&gt;http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/chime_challenge/CHiME3/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. &lt;denchmark-link:http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/chime_challenge/CHiME4/&gt;http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/chime_challenge/CHiME4/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Then, save it in you local dir and add this to the run command, such as:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./run.sh --docker_gpu -1 --docker_egs chime4/asr1 --docker_folders /&lt;my_dir&gt;/CHiME4/CHiME3;/&lt;mydir&gt;/LDC/LDC93S6B;/&lt;my_dir&gt;/LDC/LDC94S13B  --docker_user false  --ngpu 0 --chime4_data /&lt;my_dir&gt;/CHiME4/CHiME3 --wsj0 /&lt;mydir&gt;/LDC/LDC93S6B --wsj1 /&lt;my_dir&gt;/LDC/LDC94S13B
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In case that you do not have access to WSJ then I will recommend you try another recipe, such as librispeech or voxforge. This last is smaller so it will be faster to train in CPU. For testing, then I recommend you to use AN4. THis will take 20 mins to train in CPU.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;./run.sh --docker_gpu -1 --docker_egs an4/asr1   --docker_user false  --ngpu 0
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I updated to latest master and still receive the same error. Seems like line 82 in tools/Makefile is resolving to cupy-cuda==6.0.0 instead of cupy-cuda100==6.0.0. I tried manually editing the Makefile to force it to that, but changes the Makefile seem to have no effect. Is there some cached version of it? What is the correct way to change it?
