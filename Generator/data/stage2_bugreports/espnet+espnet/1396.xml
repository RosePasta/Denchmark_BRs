	<summary>Fisher Callhome Spanish ST recipe: lsm-type,lsm-weight missing</summary>
	<description>
In espnet/bin/st_train.py, the parser was changed recently, and the conf files, and other files including e2e_st.py were not changed to reflect that. This seems to break the recipe in egs/fisher_callhome_spanish/st1/
Please check the recent commit made for that file: reverting that commit should fix the issues.
Thanks

 Could you check it?

		It may be better to have some integration tests for ST like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/ci/test_integration.sh&gt;https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/ci/test_integration.sh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Traceback (most recent call last): File "/x/espnet/egs/fisher_callhome_spanish/st1/../../../espnet/bin/st_train.py", line 311, in &lt;module&gt; main(sys.argv[1:]) File "/x/espnet/egs/fisher_callhome_spanish/st1/../../../espnet/bin/st_train.py", line 305, in main train(args) File "/x/espnet/espnet/st/pytorch_backend/st.py", line 126, in train model = model_class(idim, odim, args) File "/x/espnet/espnet/nets/pytorch_backend/e2e_st.py", line 193, in __init__ if args.lsm_type and os.path.isfile(args.train_json): AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'lsm_type'
Basically, the issue if that nets/pytorch_backend/e2e_st.py needs lsm_type, which is also in the conf files, but this was removed from the parser in st_train.py in the most recent commit. Adding

to line 85 in st_train.py should fix it I think? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hirofumi0810&gt;@hirofumi0810&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
Also, the config file (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/fisher_callhome_spanish/st1/conf/tuning/train_rnn_char.yaml&gt;https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/fisher_callhome_spanish/st1/conf/tuning/train_rnn_char.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) has lsm-weight, which was removed from the argparser in st_train.py too. Maybe this needs to be removed from the config file?
