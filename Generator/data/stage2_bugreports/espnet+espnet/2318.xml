Getting this error while running demo TTS notebook colab:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AssertionError: 
The NVIDIA driver on your system is too old (found version 10010).
Please update your GPU driver by downloading and installing a new
version from the URL: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
Alternatively, go to: https://pytorch.org to install
a PyTorch version that has been compiled with your version
of the CUDA driver.
