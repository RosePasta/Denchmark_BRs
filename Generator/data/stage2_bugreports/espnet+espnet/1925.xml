		Is this a container you built by yourself? Usually docker containers built by us should report a problem with the espnet folder in root /espnet/espnet/&lt;module&gt;, but yours shows to be executed inside the folder '/code'. I will check this in any case.

		Chainer=7 is used. Simply you need to down the version to 6.0.0.

		The interesting part is that Docker containers are built based on the official release. And until now the version has not been modified yet. Therefore, the docker containers still keep the same chainer version (6.0). I suppose that he built a new container based on chainer 7.

 Yesï¼Œi built this image myself .
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kamo-naoyuki&gt;@kamo-naoyuki&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  I install the newest Chainer by pip install.
as a workaround, i comment this line :   self.device = device  and it goes on.
but i meet this issue  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/1723&gt;#1723&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  at the end of epoch 0 .
Finaly, I install Chainer 6.0.0
Thanks all.

will this issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/1723&gt;#1723&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 be fixed soon? I think, it's better to add a requirement/dependance txt.

		chainer=6.0.0 is requirements. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/setup.py#L21&gt;https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/setup.py#L21&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
