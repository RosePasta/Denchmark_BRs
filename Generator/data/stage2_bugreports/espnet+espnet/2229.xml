&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement cupy-cuda102==6.0.0 (from versions: 7.2.0, 7.3.0, 7.4.0, 7.5.0, 7.6.0, 8.0.0a1, 8.0.0b1, 8.0.0b2, 8.0.0b3, 8.0.0b4)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

cupy-cuda102 doesn't have version 6.0.0 , upgrade CHAINER_VERSION := 6.0.0 to CHAINER_VERSION := 7.4.0, please

		I see, thank you for the quick report. I'll update the makefile to care it, but ESPnet requires chainer=6.0.0, so the workaround is:
make PIP_CHAINER="chainer==6.0.0 cupy==6.0.0"   # Use not bundled cupy
make PIP_CHAINER="chainer==6.0.0"  # If you'll use pytorch backend only
make CHAINER_VERSION=""  # If you'll use espnet2 only

		Sorry, I told false. Cupy==6.0.0 doesn't support 10.2, so pip install cupy==6.0.0 is failed too, isn't it? I don't have cuda==10.2 now.

		pip install cupy==6.0.0 success,but pip install cupy-cuda102==6.0.0 failed.



espnet/tools/Makefile


         Line 39
      in
      43093fa






 PIP_CHAINER := chainer==$(CHAINER_VERSION) cupy-cuda$(strip $(subst .,,$(CUDA_VERSION)))==$(CHAINER_VERSION) 





So, the make command failed.

		Thanks. Officially cupy==6.0.0 with cuda=10.2 is not provided, so I decided disabling cupy if cuda=10.2 or later.

		They don't provide pre-built binary, but pip install cupy==6.0.0 success.
I think use cupy==6.0.0 instead of cupy-cuda102==6.0.0 would better. (but slower, because  pip install cupy==6.0.0 will compile cupy in time)

		It doesn't support officially, so I think disabling is better. We can't test it for all cases.
