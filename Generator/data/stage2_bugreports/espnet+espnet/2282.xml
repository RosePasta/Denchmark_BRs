	<summary>error in training stage "Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu!</summary>
	<description>
Hello guys!
we are running the recipe of ljspeech of version 0.8.0 but on our data set, we are using google colaboratory. At the stage of training we are getting this error "Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu!". Any help ?
log file is attached.

Thanks in advance

		Hi.
It may be some tensor is on the CPU and some on the GPU.
I guess you can fix this bug with tensor = tensor.to(device=torch.device("cuda:0"))

 This error occurs if pytorch=1.6.

		What is the solution for this probelm &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kamo-naoyuki&gt;@kamo-naoyuki&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
I am trying to train my model, the code is working totally fine on my server machine which has Pytorch 1.4.0 installed. But when I am trying to run it on Google colab which has latest Pytorch 1.6, it gives me this error in the very first tensor allocation.
In my code all objects are getting allocated in cuda, i don't understand why in Colab it is allocating any object on cpu and giving this error.
I checked &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/pull/2317&gt;#2317&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but I do not see what changes I need to do from my end.
Thank you in advance.

Hi, have you found any solution w.r.t this issue, I am also struggling with this problem where I also installed the Pytorch 1.6

In my understanding, this issue is already solved in master.

Hi, sorry for troubling you, but I am not using your repo currently but still met the same problem when I am trying to train a network myself. I am here to seek the potential and general solution for that error.
