	<summary>error when decoding TIMIT</summary>
	<description>
Hi there,
Just running the run.sh of the TIMIT receipe gives me:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11910731/64490028-68949100-d259-11e9-85a6-0f4e87745e45.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Any idea?

		I also met similar error in that ctc prefix score. Can you try adding an option --batchsize 0 into asr_recog.py in run.sh? That disables batch decoding and fixed my case.

		Yep, it's working! Is it a problem only occuring with TIMIT?

		No. I met this in AN4. I will check recent changes in the ctc prefix score.

		Great! the results reported with TIMIT are reported as character error rate right? Is it possible to switch to Phoneme Error Rate?

		If trans_type=phn is set in run.sh, PER should be reported instead of CER, no?

		Indeed! Thanks.

 can you also check your recent update (i.e., ctc_window) is working with TIMIT and AN4 (mtlalpha=0.5)?

 Is that only one thing that need to change if I want to model based on phone ? Anything else? My results are unstable now.

		Hi,

I suppose you're asking for TIMIT. In that case, yes, for what I remember.

My results are unstable now.

Could you elaborate on the "unstable" part? You mean you can't reach reported performances?

  Thanks! When I only change "trans_type" from char to phn, PER can just reach 28% ~ 30%. To my knowledge, PER should have 15% ~ 18% performance on TIMIT. So I wanna know whether I ignore something to change extrally.

		PER should be between 20.2 and 21.4 with the configuration given in  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/timit/asr1/RESULTS.md&gt;https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/timit/asr1/RESULTS.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Is that not the case?

 It seems the link for pre-trained model is missing. Could you add it please?

 Thanks! I got it. I just got PER 21.8% when mtl=0.5 are used. I think it becomes normal. Very thanks!

 I don't have the models now as those experiments were done long ago. I could run them again and upload the models.

 Sorry for the delayed reply. I don't think that's necessary in the end, sorry for the ping :)
