	<summary>make installing pytorch-cpu instead of pytorch</summary>
	<description>
When trying to build espnet today, I noticed the following problem:
Even though I have a GPU and CUDA is installed, conda always installs pytorch-cpu into the virtual environment that is created upon executing make.
I think this problem can be traced back to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/commit/1f758b5445dc8963d0785a612fae8c886342cc10&gt;1f758b5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ifeq (($shell which nvidia-smi),) # No 'nvcc' found
CONDA_PYTORCH := pytorch=$(TH_VERSION) cudatoolkit=$(CUDA_VERSION)
else
CONDA_PYTORCH := pytorch-cpu=$(TH_VERSION)
endif
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

1.) Syntactically, shouldn't the condition be $(shell which nvidia-smi) instead of ($shell which nividia-smi) ?
2.) Semantically, shouldn't the body of the two conditions be switched? When no nvidia-smi / nvcc is found, we want to install pytorch-cpu. Not the other way around.
