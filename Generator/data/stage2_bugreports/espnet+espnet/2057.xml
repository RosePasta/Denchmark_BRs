	<description>
Dear all,
I have successfully installed pesq with commands cd /home/dee/Documents/espnet/egs/chime4/asr1_multich/../../../tools &amp;&amp; make pesq
But I still got error like:
Error: it seems that PESQ is not installed. Error: please install PESQ as follows. Error: cd /home/dee/Documents/espnet/egs/chime4/asr1_multich/../../../tools &amp;&amp; make pesq
when I run run.sh under egs/chime4/asr_multich, can someone help me how to solve this?
Bests
Dee
