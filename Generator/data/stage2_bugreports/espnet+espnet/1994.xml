	<summary>need help with CHIME4 recipe in both Espnet and Espnet2</summary>
	<description>
Dear all,
I have been trying to run the chime4 recipe in both espnet and espnet2 for a while. Does anyone feel comfortable running it without issues? I really want to get help from you. I have to debug every step forward and it is really frustrating.
My first concern is that, based on the codes in espnet recipes, the WSJ0 directory structure under chime3/data/WSJ0 is different from the structure described in WSJ0 official documents.
Secondly, I got a lot of errors like:
fix_data_dir.sh: kept all 89844 utterances. fix_data_dir.sh: old files are kept in dump/fbank_pitch/org/tr05_multi_noisy_si284/.backup scripts/feats/feat_to_shape.sh --nj 32 --cmd run.pl dump/fbank_pitch/org/tr05_multi_noisy_si284/feats.scp dump/fbank_pitch/org/tr05_multi_noisy_si284/feats_shape dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track ,    dump/fbank_pitch/org/dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track copy_data_dir utils/copy_data_dir.sh: copied data from data/dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track to dump/fbank_pitch/org/dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track utils/validate_text.pl: ERROR: file 'dump/fbank_pitch/org/dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track/text' is empty or does not exist 
Did anyone solved the same issue or anyone had successfully executed the CHIME4 recipe in Espnet or Espnet2? I am really appreciate your help.
Thank you all for caring.

, could you answer it?
Also, probably better to revisit chime 4 with espnet2.
espnet2 is getting better and better now.

, I am assuming you are runing chime4/asr1, rather than asr1_multich.

For dataset path chime4/chime3/data/WSJ0/wsj0, it is different with LDC93S6B, which is official wsj0. You should be careful about the variable $wsj0 and $wsj0_data in the recipe.
About your bugs, I downloaded the latest espnet, and run it from scrath. I didn't have your bugs.
I think it might be related to the
chime4_data=/export/corpora4/CHiME4/CHiME3 # JHU setup
wsj0=/export/corpora5/LDC/LDC93S6B            # JHU setup
wsj1=/export/corpora5/LDC/LDC94S13B           # JHU setup

I paste how they look like in my side.
For chime4_data:

For wsj0:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28823245/83555388-33f9f100-a4dc-11ea-919c-c7e4c1950128.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Also, you could tell me which line of code in the recipe generating what errors. This would help me to fix your bugs.

@200987299, I am assuming you are runing chime4/asr1, rather than asr1_multich.
1. For dataset path chime4/chime3/data/WSJ0/wsj0, it is different with LDC93S6B, which is official wsj0. You should be careful about the variable $wsj0 and $wsj0_data in the recipe.

2. About your bugs, I downloaded the latest espnet, and run it from scrath. I didn't have your bugs.
   I think it might be related to the
   `chime4_data=/export/corpora4/CHiME4/CHiME3 # JHU setup`
   `wsj0=/export/corpora5/LDC/LDC93S6B            # JHU setup`
   `wsj1=/export/corpora5/LDC/LDC94S13B           # JHU setup`

I paste how they look like in my side.
For chime4_data:

For wsj0:

Also, you could tell me which line of code in the recipe generating what errors. This would help me to fix your bugs.

Dear Yuekai, thank you very much for replying so fast. The current bug/ issue I am having now gives me this line:
'utils/copy_data_dir.sh: copied data from data/dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track to dump/fbank_pitch/org/dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track utils/validate_text.pl: ERROR: file 'dump/fbank_pitch/org/dt05_multi_isolated_1ch_track/text' is empty or does not exist'
I got this bug after I re-arranged my folders according to yours. Could you show me your deeper folder structure please?
And about this bug, I got it after runing the script for an hour, after the script successfully finished running stage 1.
Thank you very much!

Dear Yuekai,
The previous bug came out when I ran chime4 recipe in Espnet2. When I ran chime4 in Espnet1, I got this:
stage 1: Feature Generation copy_data_dir apply_map.pl: undefined key F02_011C0204_STR.CH1_REAL in data-fbank/tr05_real_noisy/utt_map 
It seems the line 'utils/copy_data_dir.sh data/${x} data-fbank/${x}' in run.sh gives this error.

Dear Yuekai,
I checked those folders, they are there.

		For espnet1,
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28823245/83833691-842eaa00-a6ba-11ea-83b3-af30f8fc1716.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

First run stage 0, then pls check you have the same wc result at this dir.
Your error is might beacuse you didn't have that wav in your dataset.
For espnet2,
check data/dt05_simu_isolated_1ch_track, do you have "text" file?
Also check the two lines' output are correct



espnet/egs2/chime4/asr1/local/data.sh


        Lines 62 to 63
      in
      8c33d37






 local/real_noisy_chime4_data_prep.sh ${CHIME4} 



 local/simu_noisy_chime4_data_prep.sh ${CHIME4} 





Btw, since many receipes share the same asr.sh in espnet2, sometimes modify the asr.sh for one receipe might introduce bugs for others. You should be careful when you use espnet2. Or you could use the histroy version when the receipe is merged.
Also, every line you should know its input and output, scripts in utils all have their usage explaination, it could help you find the reason.

Dear Yuekai,
Thank you for the suggestions, I will certainly check out utils. For now, I re-run the run.sh in espnet1, I got this result:


It seems I am sort on something from the spk2utt, utt2spk and wav.scp.

Dear Yuekai,
May I ask how many files do you have under /export/corpora4/CHiME4/CHiME3/data/audio/16kHz/isolated_1ch_track ? I got 5952, which I am not so sure.

		Sure,

Your text has 9600 items, while utt2spk only 7200.
Your dataset must be different with ours. My suggestion 1. Modify or redownload your data, I believe your problem would be addressed. 2. Modify the receipe to fit your data, which I may not have time to help.

Dear Yuekai,
Sorry to @ you again, my script seems never passed stage 1. I re-checked my data, I got the same result as you presented before:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33377212/83999909-4a99bf80-a996-11ea-87e4-b5b2545e1a1e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But, I still got error like:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33377212/84000036-80d73f00-a996-11ea-8f94-faf37acc97cb.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

it seems that the code   utils/fix_data_dir.sh data-fbank/${x}  from stage 1:
    for x in ${tasks}; do utils/copy_data_dir.sh data/${x} data-fbank/${x} utils/copy_data_dir.sh data/${x} data-stft/${x} steps/make_fbank_pitch.sh --nj 8 --cmd "${train_cmd}" --write_utt2num_frames true \ data-fbank/${x} exp/make_fbank/${x} ${fbankdir} utils/fix_data_dir.sh data-fbank/${x} done
Any idea how this could happen?

		It looks like the same issue with the tr_05 dataset. This time your dt_05_real_isolated_1ch_track may miss something.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28823245/84069715-f7753c00-a998-11ea-868b-ebfaabe060fe.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If you do get the same result with me, my suggestion is to make a new copy of espnet and try to run script from scratch.  Since I can't reproduce your bug in my side, it's difficult to find the bugs.
