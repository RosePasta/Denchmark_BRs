hello，when I run aishell recipe，error is as follows：
Traceback (most recent call last):

main(sys.argv[1:])

		Hey, I ran into the same issue with tedlium2. Seems like it is caused by the fact that sentence-piece is now being used for token generation.
There no longer is a designated token "&lt;space&gt;"  for spaces.
For now, I fixed it by just commenting out
self.idx_space = self.char_list.index(self.space) 
in line 109
and replacing
if idx != -1 and idx != self.idx_blank and idx != self.idx_space: 
with
if idx != -1 and idx != self.idx_blank: 
in lines 134 and 139.
Not sure if this is the right approach though, or if something must be changed about the tokenization.

		Which version did you use? Could you checkt it via following command?
cd egs/&lt;some_recipe&gt;/asr1
. ./path.sh
spm_train --version

		I figured out this issue.
Some corpus does not include the symbol of , but  assumes it.
