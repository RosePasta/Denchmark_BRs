	<summary>torch unsqueeze is not inplace</summary>
	<description>
Unless I am missing something the unsqueeze method does not change the tensor inplace.
So in the lines below, since the result of the call is not stored, either these calls are artifact of debugging, either they are meant as inplace calls. Either way something is wrong here.



espnet/espnet/nets/pytorch_backend/rnn/decoders.py


        Lines 352 to 355
      in
      226449a






 vy.unsqueeze(1) 



 vy[0] = hyp['yseq'][i] 



 ey = self.dropout_emb(self.embed(vy))  # utt list (1) x zdim 



 ey.unsqueeze(0) 





For reference, here is the doc to torch unsqueeze function:

torch.Tensor.unsqueeze
torch.unsqueeze

A quick grep on the repo yield also those results (the last two are the ones cited above):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;nets/pytorch_backend/e2e_asr_transformer.py:307:                vy.unsqueeze(1)
nets/pytorch_backend/e2e_mt_transformer.py:320:                vy.unsqueeze(1)
nets/pytorch_backend/e2e_st_transformer.py:376:                vy.unsqueeze(1)
nets/pytorch_backend/rnn/decoders.py:352:                vy.unsqueeze(1)
nets/pytorch_backend/rnn/decoders.py:355:                ey.unsqueeze(0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Many thanks.
This seems to be a problem.

, do you have a bandwidth to take care of it?

		I see but it is not problem. We can safely delete them.

 @ShigekiKarita &lt;https://github.com/ShigekiKarita&gt;, do you have a
 bandwidth to take care of it?
