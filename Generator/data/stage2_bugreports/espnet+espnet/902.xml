, it's not always, but I observed that  will be failed sometimes.
Do you know what happned?
Can you fix it?

 Thanks, this could solve the problem.
I guess the reason is because:
in utils/min_perm_wer.py, the action I used to choose the best permutation is:

min_idx, min_v = min(enumerate(error_rate), key=lambda x: x[1])

While in test_utils/test_eval_perm_free_error_py.bats, the action I used to choose the best permutation was:

if wers[0] &lt; wers[1]:
    ret = wers[0]
else:
    ret = wers[0]

The former method uses the leftmost smallest "wer", however, the later one uses the rightmost smallest "wer".
When there are multiple utterances, the results may differ in the case where wers[0] == wers[1], but the numbers of errors and seq-length are different. I will change the if conditions or use the same way as the former methods.

		This difference does not affect the real ASR performance, because the seq-length of every reference utterance is fixed. In this test script, I randomly generated the (C S D I) numbers. This leads to the fact that even though the wers are the same, the (C+S+D) and (S+D+I) may be different.

		OK, thanks.
Please make a PR to fix this test.
