I met a bug on line 89. I can't give 0 to the left. It said ValueError: assignment destination is read-only.
I have to change line 73 to x.copy().
Does anyone know the reason?
Thanks.

		Could you explain a bit more?
When did it happen?
We did not encounter a problem in normal use.

		Yeah, I actually did not know why it happens.  I didn't encounter the problem before. I just bash run.sh, and the script failed after some specaug steps. I didn't change any code related specaug.
I am not sure whether it is related to the big dataset. I am using a 6.2Gb data.json. I have fixed the error by changing cloned =x to cloned = x.copy(). Just mark here.

		I see. We can leave as it is, but if you (or others) seem to reproduce the same bug, lets' fix it.
