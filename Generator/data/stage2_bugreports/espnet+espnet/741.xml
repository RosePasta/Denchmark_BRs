1.In spite of the comments read in this thread I keep getting the issue No module named 'warpctc_pytorch'
2.In espnet/tools/warp-ctc/build 'make' worked for cpu, but not for gpu:

		Could you share the information more?
(Which version of ESPnet, conda or system python, python version, cuda version, Linux version, and distributions).

		Hi,
I finally managed to install it on a server with gcc 4.9.2 in one fell swoop, with all components functional :)
However, on several other servers on which i work, the  gcc version is higher than 4.9.2.
On one of the servers with gcc higher than 4.9.2, i can use the functionality of using several gpu s
I did the complete installation on a server with gcc 4.9.2.
About the usage + possibility to use several gpu s:
-I generate the fbank features on the 4.9.2 gcc server,
-and if I want to use several gpu s for training, I run it on the server with several gpu s (with a gcc compiler &gt; 4.9.2), which seems to work
Initially, I tried an installation setup on a server with gcc &gt;  4.9.2, where the 4.9.2 gcc compiler was in my home directory on a shared server. However, the warp ctc was not well installed and I had to install it separately... using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc&gt;https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

ESPnet is a great tool, my compliments!
Are there any plans to adapt it to install it with a compiler &gt; 4.9.2 ?
Thanks

		Good to know that you solved the issue by yourself, and thanks for your TIPS.
I'm actually using gcc 6.3,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ gcc --version
gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and I don't have such installation issues.
(We have some error messages in pytorch warp-ctc for test code, but we just ignored them).

		Hello!
I am setting up espnet. I don't have GPU.
I ran make check_install CUPY_VERSION=''
I get:
WARNING: --&gt; warpctc_pytorch is not installed. INFO: library availableness check done. INFO: 7 / 8 libraries are correctly installed. INFO: please try to setup again and then re-run this script. Makefile:163: recipe for target 'check_install' failed make: *** [check_install] Error 1
I can't find accurate way to install warpctc_pytorch.
Please help!
