	<summary>wget in pretrained model setup returns error 404 (dead link)</summary>
	<description>
Hi
I'm planning to use a pretrained model for my research, so I followed the instructions here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://espnet.github.io/espnet/notebook/pretrained.html&gt;https://espnet.github.io/espnet/notebook/pretrained.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the "Setup environment" there's a command !wget https://18-198329952-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/home/circleci/repo/ubuntu16-featbin.tar.gz , and when running this command I receive "ERROR 404: Not Found."
Is there an alternate way to run this command / setup so I can use the pretrained models and continue the example notebook? Or alternatively, can the link be fixed?
Thanks in advance

		Can you specify which links are dead?
This notebook might be getting outdated.

		Yeah sorry, I copied the wrong command in my original comment.
The link is !wget https://18-198329952-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/home/circleci/repo/ubuntu16-featbin.tar.gz. I also edited my original comment.

		Oh, I actually tried to use v0.3.0 by following &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/kaldi-bin#kaldi-bin&gt;https://github.com/espnet/kaldi-bin#kaldi-bin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 I wrote the README to tell you, administrator, how to upload the binary. Actually tag=v0.0.3 doesn't exist.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/kaldi-bin/releases&gt;https://github.com/espnet/kaldi-bin/releases&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks! this worked instead of  the original command.
Anyway, I kept using the notebook and got to the command  cd espnet/tools; make sentencepiece.done and got the error  No rule to make target 'sentencepiece.done'.  Stop.. It seems this file doesn't exist. I've also noticed that cd warp-ctc/pytorch_binding &amp;&amp; python setup.py install has given me an error as well - RuntimeError: Error compiling objects for extension.
If this notebook is outdated, is there a different notebook I can use to setup the environment for pretrained models? Will the regular setup from the Installation Docs suffice for running the pretrained models?

I previously fixed the notebook by changing a few things after the setup Kaldi comment. Delete everything after said comment and paste this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os

!cd /content/espnet/tools; git clone https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi
!echo "" &gt; ./espnet/tools/kaldi/tools/extras/check_dependencies.sh # ignore check
!chmod +x ./espnet/tools/kaldi/tools/extras/check_dependencies.sh
!cd ./espnet/tools/kaldi/tools; make sph2pipe sclite
!rm -rf espnet/tools/kaldi/tools/python

os.chdir("/content")
!wget https://github.com/espnet/kaldi-bin/releases/download/v0.0.1/ubuntu16-featbin.tar.gz
!tar -xf ./ubuntu16-featbin.tar.gz # take a few minutes
!cp featbin/* espnet/tools/kaldi/src/featbin/

# make dummy activate
!mkdir -p espnet/tools/venv/bin
!touch espnet/tools/venv/bin/activate

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I also based my fix on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/notebook/blob/master/tts_cli.ipynb&gt;this &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
notebook which doesn't have . Also, your run.sh may not be able to find ; in that case, replace it with 

If this notebook is outdated, is there a different notebook I can use to setup the environment for pretrained models?

You can check out &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-h4Qlp25ZSQ13WOicO2vBHQGvMjzQYkv?usp=sharing&gt;my notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, although it's non-official and set up for a specific purpose: fine-tuning LJSpeech.
