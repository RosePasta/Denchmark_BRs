		wsj_mix dataset has special ways for data preparation because it requires multiple references. Please follow the data preparation in the wsj_mix recipe. Also, the Interspeech tutorial is not intended for the multispeaker case.

		Do you have the WSJ data?
Then, you have to set the path of your WSJ data correctly instead of /export/corpora/...

		WSJ data needs license. I don't have. Are there any alternative?

		No.
It would be better to make it by yourself by following the wsj_mix data preparation.
We're creating the librispeech mixture data but it will not be finished soon.
