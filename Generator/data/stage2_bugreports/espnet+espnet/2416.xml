	<summary>RuntimeError when I run the default run.sh on stage 5</summary>
	<description>
I try to run default run.sh of HKUST Chinese dataset. During stage 5, there is RuntimeError in the code of e2e_asr_transformer.py. The code piece which trigger this error is as below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;local_best_scores, joint_best_ids = torch.topk(
   local_scores, beam, dim=1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Here is the bug details:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/jinli/projects/espnet/egs/hkust/asr1/../../../espnet/bin/asr_recog.py", line 327, in &lt;module&gt;
    main(sys.argv[1:])
  File "/home/jinli/projects/espnet/egs/hkust/asr1/../../../espnet/bin/asr_recog.py", line 305, in main
    recog(args)
  File "/home/jinli/projects/espnet/espnet/asr/pytorch_backend/asr.py", line 1034, in recog
    feat, args, train_args.char_list, rnnlm
  File "/home/jinli/projects/espnet/espnet/nets/pytorch_backend/e2e_asr_transformer.py", line 549, in recognize
    local_scores, beam, dim=1
RuntimeError: selected index k out of range
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then I print the local_scores.shape which returns torch.Size([1, 6]). However, the beam=10 which means the shape of local_scores is less than beam. Could you guys please help me, how can I fix this bug? Thanks in advance!

		I had the same problem.
I have reduced the beam-size parameter in decode_config file from 10 to 5, so it works for me.
Maybe itâ€™s because the input sample is too short, so that the decoding result is even shorter than the specified beam size.

 Thanks for your reply. Did you also encounter this problem on ? I got the incorrect result which gives me all zeros during decoding, you can find it as below:

How about your result after decoding? Do you know the possible reason why the result is incorrect?

		The problem is solved in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/2433&gt;#2433&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . So I close this question.
