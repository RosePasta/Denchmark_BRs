	<summary>environmental variables for warp-transducer during installation</summary>
	<description>
I encountered an error mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HawkAaron/warp-transducer/issues/15&gt;HawkAaron/warp-transducer#15&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 during installation (Ubuntu 16.04, Cuda 10.0) and solved it by adding the following environmental variables to my bash profile (after the variables for espnet):
export CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=$CUDA_HOME
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CUDA_HOME/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LIBRARY_PATH
export CFLAGS="-I$CUDA_HOME/include $CFLAGS"
I think it may worth adding them to the installation instructions if you feel it is necessary. Or this post can simply be a reference for others facing the same problem.

		Thanks.
I actually found that we only need to add
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;export CFLAGS="-I$CUDA_HOME/include $CFLAGS"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet#step-1-setting-of-the-environment-for-gpu-support&gt;https://github.com/espnet/espnet#step-1-setting-of-the-environment-for-gpu-support&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'll modify the description.
