	<summary>using rnn-t on  librispeech recipe</summary>
	<description>
hi,everyone
I try to use rnn-t configure from /egs/vivos/asr1/conf/tuning/transfucer/train_transformer-rnn_transducer.yaml on librispeech recipe. However, it has an error after one epcho.What is the possible cause of the problem?

		Hi,
As you didn't provide the complete stack trace, I'll assume it's the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/1860&gt;#1860&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which was fixed some days ago. Could you re-build warp-transducer and try again?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cd espnet/tools
rm -rf warp-transducer warp-transducer.done
make warp-transducer.done
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Did it work out ? Is the "illegal memory access" problem fixed?

I think my warp-transducer is up-to-date, but the same problem still exists &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/b-flo&gt;@b-flo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

How to make it work. Update warp_transducer or update espnet?  Actually I install espnet and warp_transducer in the Middle of May. But still it did't work. I seems that the problem has been solved in April
