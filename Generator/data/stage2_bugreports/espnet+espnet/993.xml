	<summary>The scoring script is incorrect if any pruning is done on the dictionary or in the case of word models</summary>

Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sw005320&gt;@sw005320&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and other developers,
The command json2trn.py ${dir}/data.json ${dic} --num-spkrs ${num_spkrs} --refs ${dir}/ref.trn --hyps ${dir}/hyp.trn in the score_sclite.sh replaces all units in reference that are not in the dictionary with unk and then scores it.
This is wrong because you are modifying the reference transcription to match your dictionary. Let's say I train a model with dictionary with only 1 term "Mr" and the hypothesis is
"Mr unk unk" and reference is "Mr John Doe". This would give a WER of 0% because the reference would be modified to "Mr unk unk".
