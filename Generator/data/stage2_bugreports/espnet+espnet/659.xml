	<summary>ami recipe: RuntimeError: The keys are mismatch</summary>
	<description>
In run.sh in the ami recipe, the following command is skipped in the default setting.
if [ ! -d data/local/downloads ]; then
local/ami_text_prep.sh data/local/downloads
fi
But then, the following error occurs.
Error: File data/local/annotations/train.txt no found (run ami_text_prep.sh).
If we comment out the "if" condition and force the ami_text_prep.sh script is executed, data/local/annotations/train.txt is created.
However, then we encounter the following error:
RuntimeError: The keys are mismatch at 64th line between "data/ihm_train/tmp-5tXmf/input/feat.scp" and "data/ihm_train/tmp-5tXmf/output/shape.scp":
Could you give us a hint was is wrong?

, can you check it?
I also have the same error

 Can you apply  to data/ihm_train?
The feats.scp or text seems to have a problem. They must have same and sorted ids due to my recent changing.

		It is possible if the feature extraction was failed, then we need to use fix_data_dir.sh.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/blob/1ac8c922cbf6b2c34756d4b467cfa6067a6dba90/egs/wsj/s5/steps/make_fbank_pitch.sh#L170-L173&gt;https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/blob/1ac8c922cbf6b2c34756d4b467cfa6067a6dba90/egs/wsj/s5/steps/make_fbank_pitch.sh#L170-L173&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The duration time, i.e. 0218816 - 0218806 = 100ms, looks too short, but I'm not sure.

		Thank you for the update and I'm sorry for my late response.
I have confirmed that the "RuntimeError: The keys are mismatch at 64th line" has been solved.
The same level of WERs as the RESULT file is obtained.
When I run run.sh, I manually commented out "if [ ! -d data/local/downloads ]; then" condition.
I tested it on a CentOS7 machine with NVIDIA driver of version 410.78.

		In run.sh in the commonvoice with the language=fa, the following error has occurred:
make json files

RuntimeError: The number of lines mismatch between: "data/train_fa/tmp-1qGUk/input_1/feat.scp" and "data/train_fa/tmp-1qGUk/output/shape.scp"
I did not change anything in the run.sh except lang=fa
How can I resolve this problem?
