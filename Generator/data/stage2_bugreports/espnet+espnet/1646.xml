	<summary>New argument `embed_unit` in language model breaks backward compability</summary>
	<description>
I'm using the pretrained Transformer ASR model on Librispeech as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/ljspeech/tts1/local/ob_eval/evaluate_cer.sh#L36-L40&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Similar to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/issues/1638&gt;#1638&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I think the new argument  in language model is breaking backward compatibility. In the original issue the solution seemed to be retraining it from scratch. I'm wondering if it is possible to fix the commit so I can still use the pretrained model normally.

		Hi,

I'm wondering if it is possible to fix the commit so I can still use the pretrained model normally.

I guess you could use git revert commit-sha?

		This issue seems to affect all of the pretrained models. We should carefully keep backward compatibility.

		Thank you for the fix!
Sorry because in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs/ljspeech/tts1/local/ob_eval/evaluate_cer.sh&gt;the ASR evaluation script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, v2 was used. After using the fix, I still have trouble. But I can now successfully run by setting api to v1.
Could you also fix, I guess  for api v2?
Also I wonder what is the difference between v1 and v2?
