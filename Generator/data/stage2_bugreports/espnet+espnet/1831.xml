	<summary>`__init__.py` files missing?</summary>
	<description>
__init__.py files seem to be missing in all directories under espnet/. This causes various import errrors.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python -c "import espnet.utils"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'espnet.utils'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		We did not assume such cases, but maybe this is a good idea to do it.

		If we install without --editable option, I think this error will be happened.

 packages=find_packages(include=["espnet*"]), 





In my understanding, find_package could not find them without __init__.py.
(We added at first but we removed them... I could not remember the reason...)
It is better to add __init__.py to all of the directories as the same as espnet2/.

I think so.
Could you just add them?
I believe it would not have issues.

		I didn't know we don't have it.  This should be a bug.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/pull/1016&gt;#1016&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 removed it.

		TL;DR
If you don't indent to use Namespace packages, we must put init.py.
(I think almost all people don't have to understand about init.py strictly.)
From python3.3, there are two types of module: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages&gt;https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Regular packages: With init.py
Namespace packages: Without init.py

To install  from setup.py:  &lt;denchmark-link:https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/&gt;https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Right, I installed without editable assuming that editable is only for development.
