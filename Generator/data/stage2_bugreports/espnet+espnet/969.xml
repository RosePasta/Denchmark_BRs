	<summary>Cupy Import Error.</summary>
	<description>
Does someone have the cupy import error during making the ESPnet?
For example, if I
make KALDI=/path/to/kaldi CUDA_VERSION=9.0
The cupy 6.0 still tries to find libraries of CUDA 10.0 on default, although I have correctly set the environment.
Instead of using
cupy.done: espnet.done ifneq ($(strip $(CUPY_VERSION)),) . venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install cupy==$(CUPY_VERSION) touch cupy.done endif
I have to manually change the code to
cupy.done: espnet.done ifneq ($(strip $(CUPY_VERSION)),) . venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install cupy-cuda90==$(CUPY_VERSION) touch cupy.done endif
I would suggest making a small modification of the Makefile: )

		Thanks for the report.
If so, it would be better to switch to use cupy-cuda80, cupy-cuda90, cupy-cuda100, etc.(?)
Hmm, this is not so cool option.
