 lines = sorted(lines, key=lambda x: x.split()[0]) 





This function will aggregate some stats into one file, but the keys(name of text) will be sorted before merging together.
It will cause the order is different between lm_train_text and text_shape, and i right?

		The input texts are splited keeping the order, thus the merged file is also sorted.
If the result is not sorted, the input text at splitting stage is not sorted.

 cat ${lm_train_text} | awk ' { if( NF != 1 ) print $0; } ' &gt; "${data_feats}/lm_train.txt" 





Okay, i meet this problem because of this script (egs2/TEMPLATE/asr1/asr.sh).
It only merge all the text into lm_text, not sort the text by name.
But i use some external text and named it in my own order.
This will make this aggregate function fail in my case.

		I see. We should insert sort command at the line. I'll fix.
BTW, this tool can change the text order, but the text doesn't require sorted in our recipe except for --num_splits_* option.

		yap, it happen when i split it into numbers of lm text. My solution in my case is that i remove the sorted function in aggregate function. Anyway, thanks for replying.
