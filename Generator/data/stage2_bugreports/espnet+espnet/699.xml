, I've found that there is a case when we don't have any label output in some utterances for the switchboard evaluation data (). But current  cannot allow such cases
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/utils/merge_scp2json.py#L210-L214&gt;https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/utils/merge_scp2json.py#L210-L214&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you relax this?
This check is good for the training data, but it excludes such utterances in the evaluation set, and makes the evaluation different from other benchmarks.
