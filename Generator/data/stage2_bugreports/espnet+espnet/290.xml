	<summary>Warp CTC version in Makefile</summary>
	<description>
Since I couldn't run with multi GPU with pytorch 0.4.0, I decided to downgrade it to 0.3.1. However, I noticed a substantial slowdown in training. I think one factor might be the commit tag we are using in the Makefile, in which the GPU binding don't use the flag voltile=True (0.3.X) neither with torch.no_grad(), leading to the gradients being unnecessarily recorded in the CTC...
I might be wrong, but we should at least change to this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc/commit/34ab2673b8c5b99d8fc52bb04d53cfebbfc24fa3&gt;commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for improved performance with v0.3.1.
This, however, is not a solution for the problem in version 0.4, so we should consider alternatives if backward campatibility is something desired.
Best regards,
Miguel
