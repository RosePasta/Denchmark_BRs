	<summary>MNISTAnomaly example contains redundant code</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/anomaly/MNISTAnomalyExample.java#L117&gt;https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/anomaly/MNISTAnomalyExample.java#L117&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The line is redundant and is possibly incorrect since it uses "count" to store the numeric value of the digit. But the numeric value of the digit is actually represented by label.
Refractor the code accordingly.

		Is this still an issue?
The link in the issue is dead. And the "count" variable in MNISTAnomalyExample.java is only used as a counter. A counter which is never used after it is done counting, but not abusing the variable as in the issue.
