	<summary>0.4-rc3.9: No CUDA Devices were found in system</summary>
	<description>
I run dl4j-0.4-examples(0.4-rc3.9) on cuda 7.5, there is no output log displayed, the program can't not stop automatically. At last, I use ctrl-z to stop it. Following is the
(1) I had edited pom.xml and replaced "&lt;nd4j.backend&gt;nd4j-native&lt;/nd4j.backend&gt;" to "&lt;nd4j.backend&gt;nd4j-cuda-7.5&lt;/nd4j.backend&gt;". The sample code is in my test repo "&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hellojensens/dl4j-0.4-examples.git&gt;https://github.com/hellojensens/dl4j-0.4-examples.git&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
"
(2) Run command:
mvn clean install
java -cp target/deeplearning4j-examples-0.4-rc0-SNAPSHOT-bin.jar org.deeplearning4j.examples.feedforward.classification.MLPClassifierLinear
(3) There is no output log displayed.
(4) Motherboard, cpu/gpu info etc:
Refer to device-info.txt which included in the sample code repo, and my java version is 1.8.0.65.
Thanks!

		Please give me cpu/gpu info, and output of "uname -a"

		So, only 2 possibilities here:

glibc mismatch between one we've used for compilation and your system (less probable)
cuda runtime mismatch.

To make sure it's not CUDA runtime mismatch - could you please reinstall CUDA toolkit with the latest one?
