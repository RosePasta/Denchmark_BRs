	<summary>Error building on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with OpenJDK</summary>
	<description>
Had some trouble building this repo on my Ubuntu machine running OpenJDK 1.8 (Maven was complaining about a missing JavaFX dependency). This error disappeared once I installed Oracle JDK. Not sure if this is intentional or not, although if so, it would be helpful to mention the JDK requirement.

		Please give us full maven output. Probably that's something minor, like Pair or something like that.

		Either use the oracle jdk or openJDK/openFX. Or comment out the example.
