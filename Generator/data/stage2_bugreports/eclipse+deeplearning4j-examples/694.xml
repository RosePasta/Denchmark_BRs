		Could you please try again with DL4J 1.0.0-beta that was released yesterday?

		Hi I will try again.  Is it a requirement that I also need to build DL4J
from scratch (with all the C compiler dependencies, etc), or should this
repository be able to build from DL4J as a pre-compiled dep?

		Using 1.0.0-beta: The TickTackToe example crashes and hangs after logging:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
And the screen shows the inactive, unresponsive UI. Closing the UI does exit the application.

		I used the latest code repo of dl4j-examples, which I just cloned yesterday. I assume that is the 1.0.0-beta, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/saudet&gt;@saudet&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?

		Looks the check-in doesn't work. I ran into the same problem &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RobAltena&gt;@RobAltena&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 .
And if I run TicTacToeGameTrainer, it reports the following error,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Enter a number for the example to run (q to quit): 91
