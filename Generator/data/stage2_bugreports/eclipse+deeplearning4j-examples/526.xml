	<summary>PredictGenderTrain should read from the project resources.</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Issue Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The PredictGenderTrain example reads its  data different from the other examples. The example should just work by reading from the resources and not rely on the users copying the resource data to the user directory.
Stumbled on this while updating deprecated code.

This issue would be perfect for someone starting in OSS. This is a plain Java cleanup, no deep learning expertise needed.
