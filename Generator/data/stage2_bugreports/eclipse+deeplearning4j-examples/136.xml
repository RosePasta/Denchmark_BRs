		This is expected as the documentation of Word2VecSentimentRNN says the following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/**Example: Given a movie review (raw text), classify that movie review as either positive or negative based on the words it contains.
 * This is done by combining Word2Vec vectors and a recurrent neural network model. Each word in a review is vectorized
 * (using the Word2Vec model) and fed into a recurrent neural network.
 * Training data is the "Large Movie Review Dataset" from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
 *
 * Process:
 * 1. Download data (movie reviews) + extract. Download + extraction is done automatically.
 * 2. Load existing Word2Vec model (for example: Google News word vectors. You will have to download this MANUALLY)
 * 3. Load each each review. Convert words to vectors + reviews to sequences of vectors
 * 4. Train network for multiple epochs. At each epoch: evaluate performance on the test set.
 *
 * NOTE / INSTRUCTIONS:
 * You will have to download the Google News word vector model manually. ~1.5GB before extraction.
 * The Google News vector model available here: https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
 * Download the GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz file, and extract to a suitable location
 * Then: set the WORD_VECTORS_PATH field to point to this location.

		Right. Not a bug. Closing this.
