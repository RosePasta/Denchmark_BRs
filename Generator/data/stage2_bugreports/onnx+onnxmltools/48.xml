	<summary>Incorrect error message while converting model to onnx format</summary>
	<description>
Latest version of onnxmltools has targeted_onnx = '1.1.2' and if installed version is 1.1.1 then error message appears 'ONNX version conflict found. The installed version is 1.1.2 while the targeted version is 1.1.1' which is inverse of actual situation.



onnxmltools/onnxmltools/convert/common/_topology.py


         Line 607
      in
      5f41a2b






 if targeted_onnx != onnx.__version__: 





Also, onnx version in master is 1.1.1 and in pip is 1.1.2 but master is definitely more up to date.

		Ok. I will extract onnx version from the installed onnx package.

		As far as I can see, it is already happens, you just need to swap the
variables in line 610 and message will become correct.

 , You're right. I also changed the default version because I guess it's better to use the installed onnx version as the default version. What do you  think?
