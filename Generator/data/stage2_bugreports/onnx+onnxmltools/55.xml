	<summary>Version String Conflicts after ONNX master moves to ONNX-1.2</summary>
	<description>
Running the unit tests can produce something like:
RuntimeError: ONNX version conflict found. The installed version is 1.2 while the targeted version is 1.1.2
This problem happened because the default targeted onnx version was 1.1.2 while the installed onnx was 1.2. Therefore, user needs to explicitly specify the onnx version.
