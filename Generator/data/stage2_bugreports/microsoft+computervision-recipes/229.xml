I'm trying to clean-install the conda env and getting this error from my DSVM:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Pip subprocess error:
ERROR: fastai 1.0.48 requires nvidia-ml-py3, which is not installed.
ERROR: Cannot uninstall 'PyYAML'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.


CondaEnvException: Pip failed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		If I do

remove fastai from the yml,
install the env, and then
install fastai manually by conda install -c fastai fastai==1.0.48,

all the dependencies are correctly installed including nvidia-ml-py3

		This issue still persists for me. Tested on Linux DSVM just now and having the same error.
Also tested on my Windows machine. Got no errors but pip packages were not installed.

Once I updated conda by  to , I'm getting the same error.
