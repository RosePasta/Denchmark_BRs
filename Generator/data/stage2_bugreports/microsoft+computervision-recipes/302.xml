	<summary>[BUG] Nightly build triggers off PR</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Just checking, but these lines (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/ComputerVision/blob/3eab18177620cb15f18afd8e9cb02c63da1deba1/.ci/AML-nightly-gpu.yml#L35-L37&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/ComputerVision/blob/3eab18177620cb15f18afd8e9cb02c63da1deba1/.ci/AML-nightly-gpu.yml#L35-L37&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) should not appear in the nightly build ci yaml file right? We shouldn't be triggering out nightly build off a PR.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		There was a devops bug where CRON was not working properly. So, initially, I added the PR trigger because of that so we can ensure that builds happen. I'll check if cron is working again.

 Can this be closed, given that Young made significant changes to the devops pipelines?
