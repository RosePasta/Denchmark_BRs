	<summary>explain the visualization of sweeper status</summary>
	<description>
In the hyperparameter exploring &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/ComputerVision/blob/master/classification/notebooks/11_exploring_hyperparameters.ipynb&gt;notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the visualization of the sweeper status is not very intuitive. Please consider to add explanation about

the meaning of this Learner object self-destroyed - it still exists, but no longer usable
why there are two tables in the output. After chatting with JS, it turns out that they are resulted by the training schedule. Specifically, the first table shows the first two training epochs during which only the weights of the last two layers are updated and the second table shows the rest of epochs for updating the weights in the entire deep neural network.

Btw, I observe that sometimes "Running x of 6 permutations. Repeat 1 of 3." disappears. Please double check if this is expected.
