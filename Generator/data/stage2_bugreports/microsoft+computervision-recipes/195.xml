	<summary>Minor improvements to 01_training_introduction notebook</summary>
	<description>

from fastai.vision import *

importing * is not considered best practice. Consider importing functions/classes you need explicitly.

"we demonstrate training and evaluating a CNN image classification model. "

Consider re-wording to: we demonstrate how to train and evaluate a CNN image classification model”.

We suggest using an Azure DSVM Standard NC6 for an as needed GPU compute resource

Wording is off. Consider changing to “… NC6 as a GPU compute resource”

The helper function downloads and unzips data set to the image_classification/data directory

Change the file path to classification/data.

These are linked metrics that quantify how well the model classifies an image against how it fails.

Wording is off. Consider changing to: “…how well the model classifies an image against a known label, and where it fails”.

Use blackcellmagic extension to format the notebook code cells.
