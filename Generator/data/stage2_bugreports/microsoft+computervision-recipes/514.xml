	<summary>[BUG] For GPU tests, we should reset the GPU memory to prevent memory leaks</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There are cases when an ongoing test pipeline is interrupted, causing some test processes to hold onto GPU memory.
This GPU memory leak can lead to unexpected out of memory errors, which can be prevented by resetting the GPU memory before running our tests.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Linux

		Closing this issue as the Standard NV6 VMs on Azure seem to be using the DGX-1 platform, &lt;denchmark-link:https://superuser.com/questions/1084010/linux-mint-reset-nvidia-gpu-without-a-restart&gt;which doesn't allow for resetting individual GPUs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
