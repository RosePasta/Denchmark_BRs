	<summary>[BUG] image transformations are not applied correctly</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Bug with train/test split, looks like right now neither training nor testing gets horizontally flipped (better than both getting flipped)
"had a look at how many transformations there are in the train and test set. Both only contained a single transformation, but the training set should be two"
