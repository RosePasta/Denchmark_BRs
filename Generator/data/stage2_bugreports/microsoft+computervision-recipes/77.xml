		I'm waiting for this issue to be resolved before merge approved PR (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/pull/64&gt;#64&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) into staging.

		i think i just too high of a threshold... reducing it in my PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/pull/76&gt;#76&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Just left a comment about the error and realized that we had an open issue (this one).
Regarding the mkdir(tmp_data), please use pytest's  &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/tmpdir.html&gt;fixture&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 instead of creating temp files/dirs by yourself.
Pytest keeps last three temporal directories and clean up older ones. If you want to remove them right away, you can use python tempfile. In reco, we've been discussing this recently and probably will use combined approach, that is to create tempfile.TemporaryDirectory under pytest.tmp_path.
e.g.:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def my_test(tmp_path):
    with TemporaryDirectory(dir=str(tmp_path)) as tmpdir:
        ...
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

With this approach, you can clean up the files with python context manager.
And, also ensure that even if TemporaryDirectory fails to clean up the directory for some reason, still pytest.tmp_path will clean up them later.
