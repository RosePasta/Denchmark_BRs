	<description>
The &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/ComputerVision/blob/master/classification/notebooks/00_webcam.ipynb&gt;webcam notebook&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is a very good one to start with. It could be even better if you consider to

explain why you choose fastai after stating "This notebook shows a simple example loading pretrained model to score a webcam stream. Here, we use ResNet model using the fastai.vision package."
show the top few labels besides the most likely one in cell 6, since it may be interesting to see the difference between the confidence scores of the labels.
in cell 8, explain the necessity of forwarding the Jupyter notebook to your local machine so that the camera widget can work in case the user is using a DSVM.

		To add to this issue:


In the sentence " â€¦ are typically based on the ImageNet dataset architecture.", ImageNet is not an architecture. Consider rewording to "... are typically pre-trained on ImageNet dataset".


"transfer-learning" in the first cell, should be "transfer learning"
