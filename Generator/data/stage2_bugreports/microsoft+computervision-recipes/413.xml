	<summary>[BUG] consider to re-wording 12_hard_negative_sampling.ipynb</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please consider re-wording "the model over-fires heavily, i.e. it detects objects where none are." in detection/12_hard_negative_sampling.ipynb
I still don't get what is the problem to tackle.
"over-fire" is used in later section as well. Therefore please define it in a way that is more formal and technically sound.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the issue?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Other Comments&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
