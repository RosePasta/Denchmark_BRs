	<summary>consider use a different metric for multi-label evaluation</summary>
	<description>
For scenarios where more than 4, say, 20 labels are present in the data set but only 1 or 2 labels present per image, hamming accuracy can be inflated and zero-one accuracy can be deflated.

		hamming loss/zero-one loss is useful IF the number of average correct labels is close to the number of total possible labels (which is the case for the example we provide)
However, a weighted average per label may be better suited if there are many labels and the average number of correct labels per image is much less than the total number of labels.
