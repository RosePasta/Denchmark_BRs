	<summary>Given an input image, predict what objects are present.</summary>
	<description>
In the main README,
"Image classification: Given an input image, predict what objects are present. " can be interpreted as multiple objects can be in the image which is later explained in Object Detection. Maybe better to use something like " Given an input image, predict what object is present in the image".
