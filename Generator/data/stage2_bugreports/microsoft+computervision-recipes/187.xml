	<summary>app insights not working for only ACI deployment</summary>
	<description>
In the 23 web testing notebook, the app insights section does not work if the user has only deployed their model to ACI. The rest of the notebook allows users to test for both ACI &amp; AKS deployments, except for the App Insights bit, so the user may expect it to work there as well.
Perhaps we can make a note that that section of the notebook will only work if they deployed their model to AKS.

		I recently learned that we can enable App Insights for ACI deployments too. So, I added that to the configuration object and added a corresponding explanation.
