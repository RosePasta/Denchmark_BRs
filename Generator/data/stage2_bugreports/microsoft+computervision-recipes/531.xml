		We currently do not support fastai v2 since it is still being developed. Instead, we assume version 1.0.57 (see the environment.yml) file, but our code should also work with the latest official fast.ai &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fastai/fastai/releases&gt;release&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (1.0.60)

		Thanks. Is the role of DatasetType more to split the data into training and testing
What so the role of DatasetType.fix?

		DatasetType is defined by fast.ai and only used in this repo. See e.g. here:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.fast.ai/basic_data.html#DatasetType&gt;https://docs.fast.ai/basic_data.html#DatasetType&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
