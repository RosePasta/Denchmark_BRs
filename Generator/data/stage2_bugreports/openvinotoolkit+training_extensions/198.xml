Describe the bug
there is a problem in a way a vocabulary is build to decode beams .
When I am at my computer, inference works and license plates are recognized correctly
when i deploy same code (in both cases same docker!) to different machine, all license plates have final vocabs shifted +1. Example : correct 6AB1234, on different machine 7BC2345!
Steps to Reproduce

download openvino training extensions
do your own trainging
run on one PC , works okay
run on other PC (mb different locales??) all vocabs are shifted

Environment:

OS: 
Framework version: 
Python version:
OpenVINO version:
CUDA/cuDNN version: 10.1
GPU model and memory: GTX1080, 6G

Vocabulary to decode output of network is created in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/openvino_training_extensions/blob/1c4db62e56069067563f8c22c3e030164e03282f/tensorflow_toolkit/lpr/lpr/trainer.py#L245&gt;_create_standard_vocabs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 function, that read train and val annotation files to get all used characters.
To use lpr model in your inference code you should use static list of characters.

		thank you Alexander, I already figured it out (had "-" character in annotation file) and for deployment I used dockerfile which created empty train val files (touch val &amp;&amp; touch train) which caused to have different vocabulary during training and deployment. (Found out during debug) I do appreciate your response very much!!
