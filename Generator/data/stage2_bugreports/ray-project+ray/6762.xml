	<summary>[projects] ray session stop does not kill pods</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using ray 0.9.0dev0
Ray projects does not delete pods associated with the project when running ray session stop
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When launching the cluster with ray session start &lt;command&gt; the name of the cluster supplied in the cluster.yml is overwritten with the name of the project. However the same replacment is not made when running ray session stop.
A temporary workaround is possible by running ray session stop --name project_name
refer to the stop code here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/projects/scripts.py#L327&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/projects/scripts.py#L327&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

refer to the start code here
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/projects/scripts.py#L352&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/projects/scripts.py#L352&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Potential fix&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Alter the stop function to the following
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;def stop(name):

   if not name:
        name = project_definition.config["name"]

    project_definition = load_project_or_throw()
    teardown_cluster(
        project_definition.cluster_yaml(),
        yes=True,
        workers_only=False,
        override_cluster_name=name)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think however it would be neater if the config loader did the replacement i.e here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/projects/projects.py#L49&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/projects/projects.py#L49&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
