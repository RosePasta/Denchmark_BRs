	<summary>[xray] No object push suppression in the object manager</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

An object manager will always Push an object to a remote object manager in response to a Pull request, regardless of how recently it may have pushed the same object. This can add load to the remote object manager and delay the receipt of other objects, which can potentially cause the remote object manager to send even more Pull requests to other nodes, since it hasn't received the necessary objects yet.
A potential solution is to keep track of the status of all Push requests and make sure not to resend objects that were successfully pushed recently.
