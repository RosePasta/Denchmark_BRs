	<summary>Is this a Plasma Store bug?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

On linux without huge_page enabled, plasma store would shrink the memory size according to the shared memory limit. However, in the plasma store code, it just forgets to call SetFootprintLimit, so this never takes effect (instead it just changes a local variable):



ray/src/ray/plasma/store.cc


         Line 1295
      in
      b160b83






 system_memory = shm_mem_avail; 





I am not sure if some memory overflow was related to this. If there were, then this is a serious bug.

		I think we also check the shm limit this separately during ray init, so it might not matter that it's not set by plasma.
