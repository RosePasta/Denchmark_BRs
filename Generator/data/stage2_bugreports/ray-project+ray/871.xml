	<summary>ComponentFailureTest.testPlasmaManagerFailed test hangs frequently in Travis in MacOS/Python3 build.</summary>
	<description>
The following test fails nearly every time in Travis on the MacOS/Python 3.5 build.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python test/component_failures_test.py ComponentFailureTest.testPlasmaManagerFailed
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that the line 


ray/test/component_failures_test.py


         Line 134

 num_workers=num_local_schedulers * num_workers_per_scheduler, 




 has a bug, it should just be num_workers_per_scheduler. After making that change, I can reproduce the problem locally by running the test in a loop.
Investigating the bug a bit more, it appears that somehow a task is assigned to a local scheduler that has been removed. This shouldn't happen because the monitor should iterate through all of the tasks in the task table and clean them up. However, there may be a race condition.
