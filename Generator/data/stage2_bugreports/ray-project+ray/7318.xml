	<summary>Error Restoring PPO model with Custom Head</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have used tune to optimize and train PPO with a parametric head similar to the example seen &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/parametric_action_cartpole.py&gt;here &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, however, when trying to restore my trained model with rllib for testing I get the following error.  I am still able to continue training via tune, but cannot restore the model using the rllib standard procedure.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
ray == 0.9.0.dev0
tensorflow  == 2.0.0
Python 3.6.9 :: Anaconda, Inc.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Unfortunatley I can't provide a full script as of now, here is a snippet of the error and the call to restore.
`test_config['model'] = self._config['tune']['model']
test_config['model']['custom_options']['true_obs_shape'] = (self._config['environment']['window_size'], self._config['environment']["num_features"])
test_config['model']['custom_options']['action_embed_size'] = self._config['environment']['embedding_size']
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    #path to pretrained model 
    checkpoint = self.get_checkpoint()

    #create model 
    model = self._config['trainer'](env="TradingEnvironment", config=test_config)
    model.restore(checkpoint)`
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'keys'
lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray/experimental/tf_utils.py", line 182, in set_weights
self.assignment_nodes[name] for name in new_weights.keys()
From here
`def set_weights(self, new_weights):
"""Sets the weights to new_weights.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    Note:
        Can set subsets of variables as well, by only passing in the
        variables you want to be set.

    Args:

            weights.
    """
    self._check_sess()
    assign_list = [

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Sorry, but I would need some minimal script, where I can debug this. Maybe use our rllib/examples/random_env.py::RandomEnv with your particular action-space and provide a minimal model where this would break.

		Not sure this helps, but I get the same AttributeError for  when simply run the 'official' ray/rllib &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/tutorial/blob/master/rllib_exercises/rllib_exercise02_ppo.ipynb&gt;RL Exercise 2 - Proximal Policy Optimization&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but adding a  statement before the  statement.

 Here's a script to reproduce the error
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import gym
import ray
from ray.rllib.agents.ppo import PPOTrainer, DEFAULT_CONFIG
from ray.tune.logger import pretty_print

import tensorflow as tf
tf.compat.v1.enable_v2_behavior()

ray.init(num_cpus=3, ignore_reinit_error=True, log_to_driver=False)

config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config['num_workers'] = 2
config['num_sgd_iter'] = 30
config['sgd_minibatch_size'] = 128
config['model']['fcnet_hiddens'] = [100, 100]
config['num_cpus_per_worker'] = 0  # This avoids running out of resources in the notebook environment when this cell is re-executed

agent = PPOTrainer(config, 'CartPole-v0')

for i in range(2):
    result = agent.train()
    print(pretty_print(result))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

gives the error messages

		see also &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/8993&gt;#8993&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which seems to be the same error.
 edit: nevermind, I should've used "torch"
