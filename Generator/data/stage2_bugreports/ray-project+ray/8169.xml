	<summary>[rllib] Episode user data not reset for soft horizon</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

For soft horizon=True:

episode.user_data not reset
on_episode_start not (always) called on episode start
when summarizing metrics of multiple episodes, custom metrics for different episodes are duplicates of the last episode in the list.

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
ray 0.8.4
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/files/4530960/soft-reset-reprod.zip&gt;soft-reset-reprod.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

[ v] I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
[v ] I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
