	<summary>[dashboard] Dashboard doesn't load</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

OS: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
Ray: 0.8.6
Python: 3.8.1
After opening the dashboard URL, the page starts to load but shortly after goes white, and the following is shown in the console:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37295291/90118621-6c297580-dd50-11ea-81cc-362fc874681a.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

dashboard.err on the head node shows a mixture of these two exceptions:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ubuntu/conda/envs/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ray/dashboard/dashboard.py", line 694, in run

&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Boot a cluster, spin up some workers (may or may not be necessary).  Load the dashboard URL in Firefox

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
