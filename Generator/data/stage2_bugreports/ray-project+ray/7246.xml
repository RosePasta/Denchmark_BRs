	<summary>[doc][docs] Broken Links</summary>
	<description>
There are some broken links in your documentation.  These are mostly due to the facts that you changed the way that some files are named (multiagent to multi_agent) and some external websites have rearranged things.
I will submit a pull request soon.

		If the PR above is accepted there are still two broken links in doc/source/rllib-offline.rst that reference specific lines of code in  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/b8a9e3f1064c6f8d754884fd9c75e0b2f88df4d6&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/b8a9e3f1064c6f8d754884fd9c75e0b2f88df4d6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - a blob that no longer exists.  I didn't know the proper way to fix it.

		RE: missing reference, one fix would just be to remove it.
