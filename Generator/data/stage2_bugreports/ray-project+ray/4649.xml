	<summary>Replay Bug with large Batch</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):  Ubuntu 18.04
Ray installed from (source or binary): source
Ray version :0.6.2
Python version: 3.5.5
Exact command to reproduce: (running on custom env)

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In sync_batch_replay_optimizer.py, if a batch is sampled that is larger than the buffer, the buffer will pop off all more older samples, pop off the new sample, and then hit an error due to the buffer being empty. This happened to me when running Qmix with complete episodes on a custom env.

		The relevant line is:

while self.buffer_size &gt; self.max_buffer_size:

I am just truncating episodes for now, but suggest throwing an error, or a warning and then not storing the new large episode.
