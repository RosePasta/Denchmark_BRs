	<summary>Ray dashboard is broken in latest dev code</summary>
	<description>
pip install -U &lt;denchmark-link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&gt;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I am unable to see dashboard properly on launching .
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6428619/96217799-fc7a7580-0fa0-11eb-9f1f-00f0d76edbef.JPG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Workaround is to submit a job first . Then the dashboard is visible else you get the bellow stack
I get following stack in dashboard.err

  . For me  dashboard is still not up after 2 days . The bug &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/11384&gt;#11384&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  sort of  says  after   you need to wait till all systems are up .

		The issue in both cases is the same root cause I believe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/manishagarwal23&gt;@manishagarwal23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which is that the page does not render correctly if there are no workers. This error will be fixed in the next release of the dashboard, which branch cut is scheduled for Wednesday.
