	<summary>[Docs] Package reference not showing parameters.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The Ray docs package reference is now showing ray.init(*args, **kwargs) instead of the full list of parameters. Links between master and the last release below.
This shouldn't necessarily block the 1.2.0 release, but we shouldn't update the latest/stable docs until we fix this.
Master: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/master/package-ref.html&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/master/package-ref.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Latest: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/package-ref.html&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/package-ref.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		I haven't looked into this much but I think sphinx is confused by this decorator:


from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/c4e273920f517b18c99fbabca49135dd6e30e683&gt;c4e2739&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

not really sure if there's a workaround that doesn't involve reverting that commit... &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/richardliaw&gt;@richardliaw&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 what docs-building package is used? e.g., sphinx, napoleon
