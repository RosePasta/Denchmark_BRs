	<summary>[autoscaler] cluster_synced_files doesn't support `~`</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

~/filename is marked as "nonexistent" despite actually existing on the cluster.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS): master
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
