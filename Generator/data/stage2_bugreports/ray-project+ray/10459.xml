	<summary>Cloudpickle 1.6 doesn't work with Pydantic</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS): Python 3.6
Newest version of cloudpickle doesn't work with Pydantic and there is no clear workaround. (I tried implementing __reduce__ but that still failed)
Pydantic is becoming a core dependencies for Serve and Dashboard.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from pydantic import BaseModel
import ray

class MyModel(BaseModel):
    a: int

# implementing reduce doesn't help
#    def __reduce__(self):
#        return MyModel.parse_raw, (self.json(),)


@ray.remote
class Actor:
    def act(self, model: MyModel):
        return model.a

ray.init()

a = Actor.remote()
model = MyModel(a=42)
ray.get(a.act.remote(model))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-08-31 18:04:58,139	INFO resource_spec.py:250 -- Starting Ray with 21.63 GiB memory available for workers and up to 10.82 GiB for objects. You can adjust these settings with ray.init(memory=&lt;bytes&gt;, object_store_memory=&lt;bytes&gt;).

    "Cloudpickle Error: Unknown type {}".format(type(obj))

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		We should re-revert cloud pickle update in the future. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/10460&gt;#10460&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Btw, did you report this to pydantic repo?

		Uh I don’t think this has anything to do with pydantic itself. It should
be a cloudpickle bug though. I haven’t report it to cloudpickle, feel
free to take lead on this!
