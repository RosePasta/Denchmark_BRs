	<summary>Actors can be created on machines with 0 CPUs.</summary>
	<description>
If Ray is started on a machine with --num-cpus=0, then actors should not be created on that machine. For example, the following should fail.
import ray

ray.init(num_cpus=0)

@ray.actor
class Foo(object):
  def __init__(self):
    pass

Foo()
