	<summary>[Serve] Ray Serve was broken when non-existing call_method is called.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When call_method that doesn't exist is called, Ray Serve crashed. Ray Serve shouldn't be broken by any application mistakes &amp; errors.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Call a Ray Serve call_method that doesn't exist.
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
