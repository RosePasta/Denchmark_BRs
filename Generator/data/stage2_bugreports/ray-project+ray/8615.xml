	<summary>[RLlib] `use_lstm` auto-wrapper option not supported for ModelV2.</summary>
	<description>
The ModelV2 class does not support automatic LSTM wrapping for arbitrary catalog models via the use_lstm key in the config.
This was never supported in ModelV2, but now is becoming a problem as we are trying to deprecate Model(V1).
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
