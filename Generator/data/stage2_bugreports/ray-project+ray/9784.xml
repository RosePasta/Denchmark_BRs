	<summary>[RLlib] Error if tensorflow is not installed</summary>
	<description>
The annotations introduced in the PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/9676&gt;#9676&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 make RLlib crash if TensorFlow is not installed. The crash appears because the namespace tf1 does not have FIFOQueue attribute.



ray/rllib/offline/input_reader.py


         Line 95
      in
      156067b






 def __init__(self, input_reader: InputReader, queue: tf1.FIFOQueue, 





The same error might also appear elsewhere

 maybe you can have a look. Thanks :)

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		This should be fixed in the most recent master.
To patch this on your end for now: Just do:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;queue: tf1.FIFOQueue 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
