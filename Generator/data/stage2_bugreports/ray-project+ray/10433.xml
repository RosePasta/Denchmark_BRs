	<summary>Allow users to specify the classpath of Java workers in driver options</summary>
	<description>
There's an existing option named ray.job.resource-path, which allows users to specify the parent directory of a job resource directory. When a worker process is about to execute a task, it creates a class loader for this job from a child directory named by job ID from the parent directory. This approach is not usable since most likely users won't specify the job ID when starting a driver and the job ID is generated automatically.
