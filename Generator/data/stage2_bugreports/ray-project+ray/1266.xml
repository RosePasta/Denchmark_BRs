	<summary>Occasional failure in plasma manager during reconstruction.</summary>
	<description>
I'm encountering the following problem. I'm using Anaconda Python 3.5 and building Ray from source. The problem can be reproduced as follows.


Start Ray on an 11 node cluster.


Create a driver (I've been doing this on the head node), and run the following.
import ray
import time

ray.init(redis_address=...)

@ray.remote
def f():
    time.sleep(0.01)
    return ray.services.get_node_ip_address()

%time l = ray.get([f.remote() for _ in range(1000000)])


SSH to a different node and run ray stop.


Maybe half the time, the plasma manager on the head node will exit with the following error.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[FATAL] (/home/ubuntu/ray/src/plasma/plasma_manager.cc:1494: errno: Connection refused) The last heartbeat was sent 10292 milliseconds ago.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
