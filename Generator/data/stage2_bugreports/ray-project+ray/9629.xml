&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.com/github/ray-project/ray/jobs/363568635&gt;https://travis-ci.com/github/ray-project/ray/jobs/363568635&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
