	<summary>Monitor crashes when attempting to recreate actors which require unavailable GPUs.</summary>
	<description>
Right now when we try to create an actor, if there aren't enough GPUs available, we raise an exception (in Python). However, when machines are lost, the monitor attempts to recreate the actors that were on those machines, and if there are not enough GPU resources to do so (e.g., because GPU machines were lost) then an exception will be raised that kills the monitor. This is undesirable. For now it should push an error to the user, and later the actor creation task should probably be queued in the global scheduler or something like that.
To reproduce the problem you need two machines.

On machine 1, run

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ray start --head --redis-port=6379
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


On machine 2, run

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ray start --redis-address=&lt;head-node-ip&gt;:6379 --num-gpus=1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


On machine 1, run the following in Python

import ray

ray.init(redis_address="&lt;head-node-ip&gt;:6379")

@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)
class Foo(object):
    pass

f = Foo.remote()


On machine 2, run ray stop.


Look at the monitor logs in /tmp/raylogs. I see

		This error is no longer relevant since that code in  was removed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/1668&gt;#1668&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The monitor should have nothing to do with GPUs.
