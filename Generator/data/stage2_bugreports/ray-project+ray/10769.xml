	<summary>[tune] Trainable leaks GPUtil monitor thread</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Repeated creation-destruction of a PPO trainable results in exponential computation growth of each step of such a loop.
I have used such a loop in tests. With enough cases, exponential growth was able to bring down any server.
The problem seems related to the use of GPutil in conjunction with rllib. See the attachment below.
Perhaps this makes it more related to tune, feel free to change the title prefix.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ray 0.8.7
Python 3.6.9
TF 2.2.0+nv
Ubuntu 18.04
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Download and unzip:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/files/5217040/bug_exp_time_growth.zip&gt;bug_exp_time_growth.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker build -t bug_exp_time_growth .
docker run -p 8265:8265 -it bug_exp_time_growth bash
python trainable_creation_loop.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Calling python trainable_creation_loop.py within will demonstrate the problem outputting time measurements to both stdout and a logfile.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		What kind of times are you seeing? I'm still seeing &lt;4 seconds at 50 iterations. I did move the ray.init() out of the main loop though, since that was slowing things down quite a lot.
This is ray==1.0.0rc0 btw.

		Ah, I see this is gputil related. I'm guessing it's since we never kill this thread here:

 can that thread be a process-global singleton or otherwise stopped?

		ah yeah, it can be process global.

 All good? Can repro?
