	<summary>[docker] Default docker AWS example won't rsync across nodes</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In order to rsync files from one node to another, we rely on boto:
config = Config(retries={"max_attempts": BOTO_MAX_RETRIES})
aws_credentials = aws_credentials or {}
ec2 = boto3.client(
    "ec2", region_name=region, config=config, **aws_credentials)
instance_types = ec2.describe_instance_types()
However, this will not work on the default docker image. Thus, when you try to rsync between nodes, you run into:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;'EC2' has no attribute 'describe_instance_types'.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Repro:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

take a Tune script and run it on the cluster:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# An unique identifier for the head node and workers of this cluster.
cluster_name: basic

# The maximum number of workers nodes to launch in addition to the head
# node. This takes precedence over min_workers. min_workers default to 0.
min_workers: 1
initial_workers: 1
max_workers: 1
autoscaling_mode: aggressive

target_utilization_fraction: 0.9

# If a node is idle for this many minutes, it will be removed.
idle_timeout_minutes: 20

docker:
    image: "rayproject/ray:latest-cpu" # You can change this to latest-cpu if you don't need GPU support and want a faster startup
    container_name: "ray_container"
    # If true, pulls latest version of image. Otherwise, `docker run` will only pull the image
    # if no cached version is present.
    pull_before_run: True
    run_options: []  # Extra options to pass into "docker run"

# Cloud-provider specific configuration.
provider:
    type: aws
    region: us-west-2

# How Ray will authenticate with newly launched nodes.
auth:
    ssh_user: ubuntu

head_node:
    InstanceType: m5.xlarge
    ImageId: latest_dlami
    # InstanceMarketOptions:
    #     MarketType: spot
           # SpotOptions:
           #     MaxPrice: "9.0"


worker_nodes:
    InstanceType: m5.xlarge
    ImageId: latest_dlami
    # # Run workers on spot by default. Comment this out to use on-demand.
    # InstanceMarketOptions:
    #     MarketType: spot
        # SpotOptions:
