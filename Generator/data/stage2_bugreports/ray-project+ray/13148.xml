	<summary>[core] What's the Idle Acor for?</summary>
	<description>
Ray: 1.1.0
Python: 3.7.6
Ubuntu20 in Docker
I'm using ray cluster which has 1 Head with 2 workers in separated nodes. Total CPU num is 16*3=48, and I start 42 Actors to a ActorPool: pool = ActorPool([SelfDefActor.remote(buf) for _ in range(CPU_NUM-6)])
However, When I use pool.map() to start actors, I saw 53 workers in Ray board, And some of them are IDEL status:

		IDLE actors mean that the given actor is not executing any actor methods.
