&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Dashboard gets blank with Error:

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am not yet able to reproduce this issue as it comes and goes, but it is kind of anoying, because you never know whan it comes back. I am actually not sure if it is a real severe issue -&gt; I dont know that much about how the dashboard works internally but at least that case should be possible to prevent with adding ? behind coreWorkerStats[0], however not sure if that causes another error than at some other place...
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;const WorkerGPU: WorkerFeatureRenderFn = ({ worker }) =&gt; {
const workerRes = worker.coreWorkerStats[0].usedResources;
const workerUsedGPUResources = workerRes?.["GPU"];
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I also saw this error before in a clean environment, but right now it happens on our test cluster
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
