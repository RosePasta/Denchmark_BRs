	<summary>GCS Actor Management does not work in Local Mode</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I cannot create a detached actor (and retrieve it) using GCS Actor Management.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
ray.init(local_mode=True)

@ray.remote
class Y:
   pass
y = Y.options(name="test").remote()
ray.get_actor("test")  
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This results in the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Failed to look up actor with name 'test'. It is either you look up the named actor you didn't create or the namedactor hasn't been created because named actor creation is asynchronous.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
