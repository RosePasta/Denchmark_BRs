	<summary>[Dashboard] Broken on multi node.</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; ray start --head # start a cluster
&gt; ray start --address auto # start the worker
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

go to the dashboard:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;SyntaxError: Unexpected token I in JSON at position 4
GET http://localhost:8265/api/raylet_info 500 (Internal Server Error)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 can you try the latest wheel? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mfitton&gt;@mfitton&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/edoakes&gt;@edoakes&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  just merged a large refactor of the dashboard, and this issue might be fix now!

		I checked this again locally to make sure it's fixed by the new dashboard release and it is! The latest nightly works, and this code will be contained in the next stable release 1.0.1.

		For me the issue is not in first tab (which worked OK) but instead in the "TUNE" tab when I set the directory it gives the json error.
I got the latest(?) wheel from &lt;denchmark-link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&gt;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 following the instructions on &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The  pointed to a non-existent ````&lt;denchmark-link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.0.0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl%60%60%60&gt;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.0.0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl```&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 so I grabbed the wheel one from the table.
In any case, with that wheel I am now getting different errors showing in the log
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-10-19 16:40:12,385	WARNING dashboard.py:220 -- The dashboard on node vap0846 failed with the following error:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

so I guess something in the pip update went wrong...

 you're right, there's something wrong with the way the dashboard is built in the wheel. I'm currently working on a solution and will have it ready before tomorrow morning. Sorry for the false alarm on the fix.

		Do you want to reopen this then or is there a different issue that I should watch for a solution to this problem?

		Hey, is this issue already solved? I got the problem and when I'm going to update the Ray from the wheel, it returns 404: Not Found. I guess the wheel &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/installation.html&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 download is broken.

 sorry you ran into this issue, it's a bug in the 1.0.0 release in which the  command fails because of a broken URL. You can still install the latest nightly (which also contains a fix for this error) by following the instructions to install manually here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html#installing-from-a-specific-commit&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html#installing-from-a-specific-commit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and following the  command for the wheel that corresponds to your OS and python version.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/utke1&gt;@utke1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to loop back, the nightly wheel now has a fix for this issue. I'm going to close this issue again, but if you hit any more issues don't hesitate to reopen. Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mfitton&gt;@mfitton&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  - sorry for the delay - I tried this morning's (Nov/5) nightly pulled from  &lt;denchmark-link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl&gt;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-1.1.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

With that I got this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"No module named ray.tests"

It happens to me after I upgraded ray to 1.0.1 from 1.0.0

Happens to me as well.

		Me too, on 1.0.1.
I tried downgrading to 1.0.0 and don't get this error on that version, so this looks like a regression.

		Hi all, unfortunately the fix for this did not make the cut for 1.0.1. This should be fixed on the nightly wheels and will be included in 1.0.2 which should be released within a couple of weeks.

		<comment id='17' author='simon-mo' date='2020-11-19T22:44:41Z'>
		FYI: we decided to do a patch release to fix this issue (ray==1.0.1.post1). You can try it out with pip install -U ray.
