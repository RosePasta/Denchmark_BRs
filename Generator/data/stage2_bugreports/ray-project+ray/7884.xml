&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to build/install ray from source, but ran into the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: Unrecognized option: --incompatible_depset_is_not_iterable=false
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It seems as if in the latest bazel version, they have removed that flag: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/9f9f5ec10fed81362c35c50eeb4515bbe5bf8bce&gt;bazelbuild/bazel@9f9f5ec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
ray: 0.8.4
python: 3.8.2
os: Arch Linux
bazel: 2.2.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

The above does not apply.

		Ive been having this same issue every time I try to run the build. I have to delete that flag whenever I pull the latest code
