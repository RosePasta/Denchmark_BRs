	<summary>It's bool type init bug if RayConfig initialize by sstream</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

it's alway default value if we need reset some bool config defined in ray_config_def.h, for example (RAY_CONFIG(bool, new_scheduler_enabled, false)), which means
std::istringstream stream("true");
bool flag = false;
stream &gt;&gt; flag;
The final flag  is identical to false.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
