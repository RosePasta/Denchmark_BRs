	<summary>[core] ray.init(raylet_socket_name=...) doesn't work with multiple workers</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ubuntu 18.04 (quite certain this applies to all *nix systems)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
from time import sleep
ray.init(num_cpus=4, raylet_socket_name="/tmp/abcdef")

@ray.remote
def foo(x):
    sleep(2)
    return 2*x

ray.get([foo.remote(i) for i in range(4)])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Throws an exception
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
