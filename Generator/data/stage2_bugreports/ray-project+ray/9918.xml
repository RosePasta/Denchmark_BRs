	<summary>[dashboard] blank dashboard on RHEL7 Machine</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;I am working on a RHEL7.1 server and my ray dashboard is blank. The machine view section says "loading..." and "TypeError: Object entries is not a function". Logical view also says "loading...", memory says "No Memory Table Information Provided" and Ray Config tab says "No Ray configuration detected"&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray 0.8.6, python 3.7.0, RHEL7.1:
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;I have been running:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 ray start --head
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;and then opening the dashboard on Firefox through the localhost URL outputted by ray&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 I already have ray dashboard installed, but here is the dashboard.err file:

		Thank you, that's very helpful. It seems like there's a permissions issue with the dashboard and the /tmp/ray directory. If you make the /tmp/ray directory writable by doing chmod 755 /tmp/ray/ (or something to that effect I don't have a Linux box in front of me to validate the command), does that fix your issue?

 Looks like that fixed the previous error! Now I just get the following warnings, and the dashboard stays blank still:

 are you running Ray in an environment where you can run it with root permissions? I believe that would solve these errors, but I understand why you might be hesitant to do that.
Also, is there anything else to that exception at the bottom? The line it refers to in our source is a line that begins listening for messages on Redis

		It seems like all of these issues could be inter-process communication issues. psutil failing could also be related to the user running Ray's privileges on the machine.
Could you try running the psutil command manually from the user that you normally run Ray from, please?

 Ok, sorry about that -- I wasn't running things in root. I ran everything as root and the psutil issues got resolved. My dashboard is still blank though, and looks like this:

		Hmm, the issue could be that "172.23.49.92:43815" (the redis address that Ray is trying to connect to), is not accessible from that machine? Essentially, the dashboard collects details about the worker processes running on each other node in the cluster over Redis. This means that you will need to give the same permissions for psutil on other nodes in the cluster, as well as make sure that your head node is able to connect to your redis cluster. The redis.out and redis.err log files might also be helpful.

 I see. So far I've just been starting my head node and trying to view the ray dashboard on the same server, so I am unclear why redis would run into permission troubles there? My redis.err file is empty, but the redis.out file has:
