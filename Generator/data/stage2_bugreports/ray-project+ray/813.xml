	<summary>Ray installation fails on CentOS.</summary>
	<description>
I'm testing this on the default Amazon Linux AMI.
First I had to do pip install cmake to get a sufficiently recent version of cmake. Then I ran into this issue.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;-- Checking for module 'arrow'
--   No package 'arrow' found
CMake Error at cmake_modules/FindArrow.cmake:119 (message):
  Could not find the Arrow library.  Looked for headers in , and for libs in
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:157 (find_package)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The issue seems to be that we hardcode the path PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$ARROW_HOME/lib/pkgconfig in src/thirdparty/build_thirdparty.sh, but on this machine it was generated as $ARROW_HOME/lib64/pkgconfig.
As a temporary solution, doing cp -r $ARROW_HOME/lib64 $ARROW_HOME/lib solved the problem.

		This should be more or less fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/840&gt;#840&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but getting Ray to work on a fresh CentOS machine still isn't straightforward. You probably have to upgrade cmake and maybe do a few other things.

		Closing for now since it should work (e.g., we compile our wheels on the manylinux image). However, there are probably a number of annoying things that have to be done to build Ray on a fresh centos image (like upgrading cmake), but I'm not sure what they are so those should be tracked in a different issue (perhaps the issue should be to document what steps need to be taken).
