	<summary>[ray_client] ray.get_runtime_context doesn't work with Ray Client</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ray.get_runtime_context is used in Ray Serve to identify the NodeId of the head node to place specific actors there. I'd expect that this returns the runtime_context of the job that is running on the ray client server. Right now, it just errors.
import ray
ray.util.connect("localhost:61234")

print(ray.get_runtime_context().node_id.hex())
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(ray.get_runtime_context().node_id.hex())
  File "/Users/eoakes/code/ray/python/ray/runtime_context.py", line 58, in node_id
    node_id = self.worker.current_node_id
  File "/Users/eoakes/code/ray/python/ray/worker.py", line 148, in current_node_id
    return self.core_worker.get_current_node_id()
AttributeError: 'Worker' object has no attribute 'core_worker'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
