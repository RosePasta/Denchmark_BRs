	<summary>[rllib]The use of conv_filter</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I add the conv_fliter parameter in the config,the error would appear.
The ray is the latest wheel.
And the config I set is that:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;config = {'gamma': 0.9,
          'lr': 1e-2,
          'num_workers': 1,
          'num_envs_per_worker': 1,
          'train_batch_size': 512,
          'num_gpus': 8,
          'model': {
              'dim': 84,
              'framestack': False,
              'no_final_linear': False,
              'conv_filters': [
                  [16,8,4],
                  [32,4,2]
              ],
              'fcnet_hiddens': [256, 256],
              'use_lstm': True,
              'lstm_cell_size': 256,
          }}
trainer = agents.impala.ImpalaTrainer(env='BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4', config=config)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The error is in the visionnet.py in 87 line.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;      if vf_share_layers:
            last_layer = tf.keras.layers.Lambda(
                lambda x: tf.squeeze(x, axis=[1, 2]))(last_layer)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and the error is :
Can not squeeze dim[1], expected a dimension of 1, got 9 for 'default_policy/lambda/Squeeze' (op: 'Squeeze') with input shapes: [?,9,9,32].
Is there some probles on the conv_fliter out to the next layer?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hecong97&gt;@hecong97&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thanks for filing this. For a quick fix, try adding yet another conv2d filter that results in a [B, 1, 1, n] output, so it's squeezable, like so (but we should automate this):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;              'conv_filters': [
                  [16,8,4],
                  [32,4,2],
                  [64,11,1]  # &lt;- the 64 (number of filters) will be your conv2d output size; to which you can attach further fc layers.
              ],
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Have the same error and I don't know hot to fix.
"ValueError: Can not squeeze dim[1], expected a dimension of 1, got 8 for 'default_policy/lambda/Squeeze' (op: 'Squeeze') with input shapes: [?,8,8,1]."
Using config:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;'model': {	
	'conv_activation': "relu",
	'dim': 10, 
	
	'conv_filters': [  	
		 [32, [3, 3], 1], 
		 [16, [3, 3], 1],
	],
	
	'fcnet_hiddens': [256], 
	'fcnet_activation':'tanh'
	},
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
