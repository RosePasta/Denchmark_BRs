	<summary>[ray_client] Cannot instantiate imported actor class</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Get a "ray is not connected" error when trying to instantiate an actor class that was imported
c.py:
import ray

@ray.remote
class C:
    pass
test.py:
from c import C

import ray
ray.util.connect("localhost:61234")

c = C.remote()
Output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(base) code/ray % python test.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    c = C.remote()
  File "/Users/eoakes/code/ray/python/ray/actor.py", line 410, in remote
    return self._remote(args=args, kwargs=kwargs)
  File "/Users/eoakes/code/ray/python/ray/actor.py", line 557, in _remote
    worker.check_connected()
  File "/Users/eoakes/code/ray/python/ray/worker.py", line 207, in check_connected
    raise RaySystemError("Ray has not been started yet. You can "
ray.exceptions.RaySystemError: System error: Ray has not been started yet. You can start Ray with 'ray.init()'.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
