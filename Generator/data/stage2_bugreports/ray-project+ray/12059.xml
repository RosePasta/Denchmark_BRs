	<summary>ray.init() fails on macOS Big Sur</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
OS version: macOS Big Sur
Ray version: should impact all versions.
Issue:
ray.init() fails when starting redis, with the following error stack.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "debugging.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;

    raise response
redis.exceptions.ResponseError: The operating system is not able to handle the specified number of clients, try with -33
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Digging into this issue, I found it's because  (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/90574b66cce07f8f4fabe99bee6ff6419c097a0b/python/ray/_private/services.py#L977&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) now returns  on Big Sur, while it returns  on previous macOS versions.
Removing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/90574b66cce07f8f4fabe99bee6ff6419c097a0b/python/ray/_private/services.py#L984&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can fix this issue. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ericl&gt;@ericl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/edoakes&gt;@edoakes&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rkooo567&gt;@rkooo567&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Do you know what is the purpose of this code? Is it still needed?
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Just ray.init().

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Oh interesting. We set it before because 256 limits are usually not enough to handle all connections to Redis.

		In the cluster setting, you could have many hundreds of thousands of workers, so maxclients needs to be at least that large.

		Just found the reason why  returns  is not related to Big Sur, it's because of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/90574b66cce07f8f4fabe99bee6ff6419c097a0b/python/ray/worker.py#L633&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		It looks like you've already figured out the issue, but I'll post my error message here since it's slightly different and the last line gives an idea of what we could try setting the upper limit to (namely, 4294967295).  I don't know if that makes sense though, I'm not familiar with this part of the code.
[...same as above...]
  File "/Users/archit/anaconda3/envs/ray-py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/redis/connection.py", line 756, in read_response
    raise response
redis.exceptions.ResponseError: Invalid argument '9223372036854775775' for CONFIG SET 'maxclients' - argument must be between 1 and 4294967295 inclusive

		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/raulchen&gt;@raulchen&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we can probably cap to an upper limit of 10000 or something for redis connections?
