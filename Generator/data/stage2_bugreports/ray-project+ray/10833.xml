	<summary>[RLlib] Revert dependency on `ray.get_gpu_ids()` (not None) to place TorchPolicy on GPU.</summary>
	<description>
Revert dependency on ray.get_gpu_ids() (not None) to place TorchPolicy on GPU (should only check torch.cuda.is_available() for now).
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
