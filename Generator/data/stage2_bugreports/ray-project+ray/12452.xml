I'm getting
AttributeError: 'StandardStreamInterceptor' object has no attribute 'close'
when running e.g. a test case.
This shows up on:
MacOS (and also our travis)
Py3.7
Ray 1.1.0dev (master branch)
Reproduce e.g.:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python ray/rllib/tests/test_supported_spaces.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
