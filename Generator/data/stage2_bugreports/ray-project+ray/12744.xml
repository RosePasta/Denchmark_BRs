		Currently, the memory units that are specified by cluster_resources are different from GB because of some legacy scheduler code. We are currently developing the new scheduler now, and this issue will be resolved once that's completed.

 Thanks for your reply. What's the roadmap of the new scheduler? Will it be included in the next release?
