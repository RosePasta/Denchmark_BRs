	<summary>[tune] PBT hyperparam_mutations does not allow for nested dicts any more</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ray: 0.8.2
Just recently a new check that hyperparam_mutations are either a list or a callable was introduced. (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/tune/schedulers/pbt.py#L182&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/tune/schedulers/pbt.py#L182&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
Unfortunately the configs I use with my Experiments are nested dicts and I can now no longer use PBT to tune parameters in those nested dicts.
Is there a reason that nested dicts are no longer allowed? :(

		Awesome, thanks! Can you make a quick bug fix release for this or do we have to wait another month for the next normal release? :)
