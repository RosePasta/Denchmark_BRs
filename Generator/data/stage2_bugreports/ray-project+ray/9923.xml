	<summary>[Tune] Long running distributed test failing</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The RaySGD+Tune long running distributed test is failing due to this error:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8068268/89367475-f78a7300-d68d-11ea-8aeb-7b27ecf2ab2d.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We need to modify either the test or the kill_node command to not kill any nodes if there is only one node left in the cluster.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
bash ci/long_running_distributed_tests/run.sh --workload=pytorch_pbt_failure
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Closing stale issue since the latest release passes. Please re-open if it is still a problem.
