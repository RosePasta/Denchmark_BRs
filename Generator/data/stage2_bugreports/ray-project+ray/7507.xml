	<summary>[tune][rllib] Memory usage very different on newer versions of Ray</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I ran a toy environment script, using Impala and a p3.2xlarge along with a c5.18xlarge, and thus had 64 workers and 1 gpu... I ran the same script using ray 0.8.1 vs 0.8.2 .... I ran it for 1 hour... I'm attaching the screen shots I took of the final results summary... you'll see that memory consumed in 0.8.2 is resulting in a "low memory" warning.  I see the same behavior in the most recent codebase as well.
Are you able to replicate this behavior? What is causing this?

python 3.6.8, tf 2.1, Ubuntu 18.04

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

[x ] I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
[x ] I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		I'm not seeing the same behavior in the latest version, so closing.
