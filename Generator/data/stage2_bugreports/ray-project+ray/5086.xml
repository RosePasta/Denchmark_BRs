	<summary>[rllib] a question on rollout</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In rollout() function of rllib/rollout.py,  is initialized (assigned) in the first branch while no  in the second branch (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/rollout.py#L133&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/rollout.py#L133&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ). My script crashed due to no  when it was used in the while loop (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/rollout.py#L152&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/rollout.py#L152&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )

		Looks like a bug, seems like we should init it to some random actions in that branch as well, or avoid referencing actions_init.
