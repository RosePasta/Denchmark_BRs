	<summary>[GCS] Actor creation / kill Performance Regression. Stress Test, `test_dead_actors.py` became slower with GCS service.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
nightly
There was performance regression (test_dead_actors.py was 4 times slower) with GCS service on. We will turn off the GCS service for the release 0.8.5. We need investigation on this.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;GCS ON&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/ci/regression_test/stress_tests&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/ci/regression_test/stress_tests&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

. Autoscaler cluster configuration is in  folder.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		This wouldn't cause issues for most of workflow. Will move it to P1.

		Downgrading to P3 since the performance of actor launch is not typically important, and the regression is modest.
