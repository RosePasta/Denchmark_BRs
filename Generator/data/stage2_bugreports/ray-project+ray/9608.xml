&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016670/88035509-da758080-cb74-11ea-87ac-e010e3289c57.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The path variable is reserved in zsh, which is bind with PATH, so the path should not be used as a common variable in the script.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Thanks for reporting. I'll change it, but I don't believe we actually support zsh yet; these are meant to be Bash scriptsâ€”there are a number of incompatibilities (like brackets) that we've never accounted for. So you should try to use Bash if possible regardless.
 Actually, &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule&gt;Bazel is supposed to call Bash&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, so this seems more like a Bazel bug.

Bazel is supposed to call Bash

My OS is macOS Catalina which make zsh as a default shell tool. So I think it will block many developers.
