	<summary>[sgd] dcgan.py needs a better reference to mnist_cnn.pt</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

dcgan.py sample identifies classification model path as following:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"classification_model_path": os.path.join(
            os.path.dirname(ray.__file__),
            "util/sgd/torch/examples/mnist_cnn.pt")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

But Ray doesn't have samples in the package. In case I just want to run the sample using pre-installed ray from pip, I got the following error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python dcgan.py --num-workers 44

mory=&lt;bytes&gt;, object_store_memory=&lt;bytes&gt;).

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
ray 0.8.4,
Ubuntu 18.04,
Torch 1.4.0
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
python dcgan.py from ./ray/python/ray/util/sgd/torch/examples directory of the repo
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 Thanks for opening this issue! The solution to this is just to download it from Git rather than packaging it with Ray.
I can get to this later this week, but feel free to push a PR!
