&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray nightly, TF 2.2, Python 3.7.7, running a tune training workload.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/root/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/new_dashboard/utils.py", line 351, in _update_cache response = task.result()

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 could you please provide some info on how to reproduce this? e.g., cluster yaml and what the tune job was

		Yes, I will try to get the repro. Feel free to leave as P2 until then, just wanted to document the error for posterity. Additionally, it also looks like we're just querying a dictionary for a value that may or may not exist. It seems like if we just did node_stats.get("viewData", {&lt;insert-default&gt;} then we'd cover our bases.

		In fact just looking at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/dashboard/datacenter.py#L146&gt;the code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It seems like this is almost designed to occur as
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    node_stats = dict(DataSource.node_stats.get(node_id, {}))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Will create an empty dictionary if it can't find the node_id and in 4 lines later we try to extract a value from it.
I realize a reproduction would be nice, but this also just seems like a bit of a code smell where we're creating an empty dictionary and later assuming it to have a certain key.

 yeah, see the PR above which fixes it. Want a repro mostly to make sure there aren't other related corner cases / assumptions we're making
