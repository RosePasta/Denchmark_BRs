	<summary>[docker] Config updates do not propagate into the container</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Docker file mounts are based on the inode of the host file. When rsync replaces the host file, it creates a new inode, effectively making the mount useless.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Run ray up myscript.yaml
Update worker nodes to include a larger number of min/max/initial workers
Rerun ray up myscript.yaml
Run ray attach myscript.yaml
Open up ~/ray_bootstrap_config.yaml and note how the changed values are not reflected there

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
