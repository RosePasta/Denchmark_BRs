	<summary>[RLlib] Error when calling `rllib/models/catalog.py::get_action_shape()` and tf is not installed.</summary>
	<description>
When framework=torch and rllib/models/catalog.py::get_action_shape() is called, e.g. from within Policy::_create_dummy_batch_from_view_requirements(), rllib crashes.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
