&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Nightly
When I ran ray microbenchmark in the latest master, I could see these errors that breaks the dashboard. I assume it happens when async actor monitor is calling the show_web_ui.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run ray microbenchmark. It happens sometimes at async actor benchmark.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 I assume this happens because of the same reason as CreateProfile errors.
