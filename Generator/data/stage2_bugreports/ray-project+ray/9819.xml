	<summary>[RLlib] Error if tensorflow is not installed</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
When TensorFlow is not installed RLlib crashes because tf is not None and but it doesn't have a keras attribute.



ray/rllib/models/tf/layers/gru_gate.py


         Line 6
      in
      01125b8






 class GRUGate(tf.keras.layers.Layer if tf else object): 





Thank you for your work :)

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Hmm, tf should be None, because it can't be imported, no?
What's the value of tf in your case.

		PyCharm left the TensorFlow package directory after removing its content so it was importing an empty package.
All works now thx
