	<summary>[rllib] PPO torch super slow again as OMP_NUM_THREADS not being set to 1</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Seeing the same exact slowdown problem again as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6962&gt;#6962&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (but not the memory leak reported in that bug).  The same fix works again by setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=1.  This issue was originally fixed by setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 by default in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/7006&gt;#7006&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but now it looks like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/7254&gt;#7254&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 removed the fix so that the bug is back.
It would be great if there were a regression test to catch this bug so it doesn't accidentally reappear again.

See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6962&gt;#6962&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have  (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6962&gt;#6962&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Thanks. Reverting, and added a test so it doesn't happen again.
