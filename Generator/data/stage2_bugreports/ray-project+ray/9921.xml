&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Long running test pbt.py seems to OOM after running for a day.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18510752/89354845-ca7a9800-d66e-11ea-9b9b-6f3b6656553b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

You can see some of workers use lots of memory (5GB).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run pbt.py for a long time.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Closing stale issue since the latest release passes. Please re-open if it is still a problem.
