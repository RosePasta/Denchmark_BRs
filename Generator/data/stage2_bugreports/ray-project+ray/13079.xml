	<summary>[CI] Windows CI failure</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Many Windows CI tests fails with crazy messages like address violation for a while recently. Does anyone know what happen? (or it just because windows CI is very flaky now?)

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
