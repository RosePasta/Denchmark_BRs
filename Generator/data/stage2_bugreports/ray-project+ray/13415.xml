	<summary>ray.get_runtime_context().get() fails on a driver</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ray.get_runtime_context().get() errors when running on a driver. This should still return the useful context information (e.g., current node ID) or at the very least have a better error message.
import ray
ray.init()

print(ray.get_runtime_context().get())

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Ah I think this should be a simple fix. I will take a look at it later.
