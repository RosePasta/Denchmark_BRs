	<summary>[rllib] torch GPU acceleration broken for PPO</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

rllib Regression test result from PPO looks slower. The exact cause it uncertain, but it seems like torch GPU acceleration doesn't work as expected (everything else looks fine weirdly)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
run regression test PPO workload. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/ci/regression_test/rllib_regresssion_tests&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/ci/regression_test/rllib_regresssion_tests&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Maybe this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/8335&gt;#8335&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where using a gpu with torch fails with an error (in that case with a custom policy but I see the same error with PPO).

		This is probably due to torch==1.5.0 installed. Try pip install torch==1.4.
Closing this issue.

		Is it possible to restrict the torch version when using this? I think we should create a PR for that before we close it.

		Isn't 1.5 newer? So we don't support latest torch?

Closing this issue.

I tried downgrading to torch 1.4 but the issues still occur. Is there any quick workaround for now?
