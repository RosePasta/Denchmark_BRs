	<summary>[rllib] rollout.py should set num workers = 0</summary>
	<description>
when issuing a rollout.py  for a checkpoint why does it run the full set of workers specified in params.json.
If it is being run only to evaluate should it not just run one.

		It should probably set num_workers = 0, this was an oversight.

		I've run it by setting workers to 1 I think I tried 0 and it did not like it.

		Oh hm, also some algorithms like Ape-X also have a lower limit of 2. Ideally we would probably just create the policy object and not a full agent I suppose.
