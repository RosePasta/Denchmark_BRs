	<summary>[tune] pbt exploit clone trial in different epochs.</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I'm using pbt for hyperparameter search. I find the "expoit" function will clone trial in different epochs, ie, 32-&gt;30 or 27-&gt;29.  For neural network training, the performance is largely affected by the epochs passed. The different trial in tune is not synchronous. Which will make the trial run fastest(more epoch) have more chances to cloned its weights to other weights, this is not reasonable. Is there any method to avoid this from happening?

		This should be fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/10283&gt;#10283&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, where you can specify to run in synchronous mode. Feel free to re-open if you have more questions.
