	<summary>The ray stuck when report metrics</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I choose Ray with AsyncHyperBandScheduler to search Optimal hyperparameters for deep networks, but i found the program stuck when report metrics to Ray, how can i solve it?
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
version:1.0
tensorflow version:1.14
os:ubuntu18.04
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    self.estimator.train(input_fn=self.train_input_fn, steps=None)
    save_dir = os.path.join(Configs["serving_model"],str(self.trial_name))
    #os.makedirs(save_dir, exist_ok=True) 
    export_model(self.estimator,save_dir)#Configs["serving_model"]) #saving model corresponed to trial_name
    self.metric_val = self.estimator.evaluate(input_fn = self.val_input_fn)
    

    return {
            "epoch": self.iteration,
            "val_cvr_auc": self.metric_val['cvr_auc'],
            "val_ctr_auc": self.metric_val['ctr_auc']
            }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Can you print the types for self.metric_val['cvr_auc']?

Can you print the types for self.metric_val['cvr_auc']?
I just found out that it occurs due to my large evaluation set, not bug of Ray
