	<summary>Ray error logs should be printed to stdout</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

c++ errors should be printed to the driver's stdout but aren't.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Put a RAY_LOG(ERROR) &lt;&lt; "dfasdf"; in CoreWorker::ExecuteTask and in NodeManager::HandleWorkerLeaseRequest. Neither will will be printed.
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 I think this is caused by this change.

		Shouldn't they go to stderr?

		The existing behavior is that raylet's stderr is redirected to the driver's stdout. The behavior has been that way for quite some time (years), but there is some unused code that suggests that it wasn't always this way...
