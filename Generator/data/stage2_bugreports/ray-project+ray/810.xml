	<summary>Need to package pyarrow along with our wheels.</summary>
	<description>
In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/692&gt;#692&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we started building building pyarrow (that is, if you run Ray's , then inside of the  script, we call pyarrow's ).
There are a couple of problems here.

Pyarrow isn't included in the wheels that we build, so they have a missing dependency and won't work (we don't want to just pip install pyarrow because we want to compile specific versions of pyarrow). Though ideally later when things are more stable we'll just pip install pyarrow.
The current approach may cause problems for people who are using pyarrow separately from Ray. Perhaps the version of pyarrow that we're using should only be installed locally to Ray, that is, you could import it with import ray.pyarrow.

. The approach was to build (but not install) pyarrow (as part of ), then copy the  directory to . Then in , we add  to the python path so that  finds the right pyarrow.
