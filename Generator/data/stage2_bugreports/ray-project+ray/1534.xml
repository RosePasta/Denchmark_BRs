		Seems reasonable, the node probably isn't part of a cluster if the network is down.

		It could be part of a cluster that is not connected to the internet. This just means that it can't connect to google I think.

		Ic, in that case the head node needs to know it's private ip to get workers connected to it. So 127.0.0.1 won't work. Is it possible to resolve the private ip even without internet access?
