	<summary>[C++ API] Objects leaking in the C++ language Support.</summary>
	<description>
The c++ API is leaking objects. We suspect this is due to reference counting. We might need to add a class like this in the C++ API &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/includes/object_ref.pxi&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/includes/object_ref.pxi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;auto r1 = actor5.Task(&amp;Counter::Add, r0).Remote();
auto r2 = actor5.Task(&amp;Counter::Add, r1).Remote();
auto r3 = actor5.Task(&amp;Counter::Add, r2).Remote();
int result3 = *(Ray::Get(r3)); // this will remove r0, r1, r2, r3, which is pretty scary.
// int result2 = *(Ray::Get(r2)); // will not work
// int result2 = *(Ray::Get(r1)); // will not work
// int result2 = *(Ray::Get(r0)); // will not work
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		We can refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/milestone/16&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/milestone/16&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for adding reference counting support in C++ worker.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kfstorm&gt;@kfstorm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
!
There are recently some users interested in C++ (Intel, Alibaba). Just in order to set right expectations, when do you think we can have this issue resolved? cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SongGuyang&gt;@SongGuyang&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
