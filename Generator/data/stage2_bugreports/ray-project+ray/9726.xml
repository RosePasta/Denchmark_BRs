	<summary>ray.tune.error.TuneError: ('Trials did not complete'ï¼‰</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The only error is "
File "/home/guoxu/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/tune/tune.py", line 349, in run
raise TuneError("Trials did not complete", incomplete_trials)
"
Don't know how to figure out where is the problem. Is there a way to point to the line which triggered this error?
Code:
ray.init(num_cpus=os.cpu_count(), num_gpus=torch.cuda.device_count(), temp_dir='path/ray_log')
sched = ASHAScheduler(
time_attr="training_iteration",
metric="macro_f1",
mode='max',
)
analysis = tune.run(
train,
name="grl_adda_lys",
scheduler=sched,
verbose=True, #
stop={"macro_f1": 0.30, "training_iteration": num_iters},
resources_per_trial={"cpu": 1, "gpu": 0.5},
num_samples=1,
config=configargs,
)
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Python 3.7
OS: linux
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
