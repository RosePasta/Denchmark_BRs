	<summary>Subclasses of OrderedDict are not serialized correctly.</summary>
	<description>
See discussion in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/1800&gt;#1800&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
I tried registering a custom serializer, but it didn't help when the object was created on a worker.

		Looks like it's a problem with PyArrow. Minimal Ray example:
import ray
from collections import OrderedDict
ray.init()

class SubDict(OrderedDict):
    pass

@ray.remote
def f():
    return SubDict()

y = ray.get(f.remote())
type(y)
Minimal PyArrow example:
import pyarrow
import collections

class SubDict(OrderedDict):
    pass

type(pyarrow.serialize(SubDict()).deserialize())
The only PyArrow OrderedDicts issue I can find is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/1152&gt;this one&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I'll have a look later and open an issue if the solution isn't immediately obvious.

		You're right that it's a pyarrow issue and related to the issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/4463&gt;#4463&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Another workaround could be to simply register a custom serializer for your class (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#ray.register_custom_serializer&gt;https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#ray.register_custom_serializer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
