	<summary>[autoscaler] request_resources demands don't update after multiple calls</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There seems to be a problem where request_resources values don't change if request_resources is called multiple times.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;request_resources(bundles=[{"CPU": 1}])
sleep(10)
request_resources(bundles=[{"CPU": 2}])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

will result in a permanent request for a single CPU.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		I think this is fixed in nightly (at least it works for me, checking ray status locally).
