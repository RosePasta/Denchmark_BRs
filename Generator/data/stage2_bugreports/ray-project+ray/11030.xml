	<summary>Using asyncio.wait on a ray ObjectRef can result in InvalidStateError logs</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Versions&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

$ python --version

$ python -c "import ray; print('VERSION:', ray.__version__, 'COMMIT:', ray.__commit__)"
VERSION: 0.8.7 COMMIT: 56810e136587432ed4758d882bf8894b930355e3
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

We use this construct to wait for an actor's result. The actor could fail (e.g. by going OOM) so we also do some periodic health checks on it. asyncio.wait is used to check for both the result and the health check concurrently.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When using asyncio.wait on a ray ObjectRef which represents an aync actor method call, sometimes (with high probability) the set_result callback is ran twice, resulting in an InvalidStateError. Since this exception is thrown in the callback itself, the code does not crash but it does result in some spammy error logs.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Related&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/8841&gt;#8841&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 seems to be related, but I have created a new ticket because:

I cannot reproduce the original error from that ticket anymore using the latest releases.

import ray
import time
import asyncio

ray.init()
@ray.remote
def f():
    time.sleep(5)

async def test():
    oid = f.remote()
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(oid, timeout=1)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        pass
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(oid, timeout=1)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        pass

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(test())

The changes the ticket introduced are not in master anymore (https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/8842/files)

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

[‚úîÔ∏è] I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
[‚úîÔ∏è] I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

Some clarification:
The issue does not manifest itself every time the script is run. It can take a few times.
Only tested with the latest stable wheels.

 Isn't it supposed to be fixed right? Was it pushed after 0.8.7?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robbertvc&gt;@robbertvc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Is it possible to try the latest commit and see if it still occurs?

 Hi Sang, unfortunately we can still reproduce it with the official ray 1.0.0 release. Subjectively, it seems to take a bit longer to reproduce though, this time it took  around 20 runs of the script.

 Can we close after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robbertvc&gt;@robbertvc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 tries this one more time? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robbertvc&gt;@robbertvc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Would you mind trying the latest master and see if it is reproduced?

		Sure. This is automatically closed by the PR merge.

		Sorry for the delay, but good news: we cannot reproduce this anymore using ray 1.0.1 üéâ
