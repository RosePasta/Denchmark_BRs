	<summary>test_metrics::test_raylet_pending_tasks seem to be hanging when GCS actor management is on.</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Discovered from CI. Not 100% sure if it due to GCS actor management.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Couldn't reproduce, and it doesn't seem to occur from CI anymore. It probably could have been related to some other issues that were already resolved. Close it now.
