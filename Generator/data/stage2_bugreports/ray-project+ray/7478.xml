	<summary>[rllib] Ape-X explorations / rewards incorrectly calculated in 0.8.2</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

0.8.2 seems to have the following bug:

All per-worker exploration epsilons are set to the same value, instead of being spread across a distribution of epsilons
We report rewards from all workers instead of just the 1/3 of workers with the lowest epsilons.

Oddly, Ape-X still passed the regression test for Breakout training--- in fact, it did better (perhaps suspiciously better).
