	<summary>Test failure in valgrind plasma test.</summary>
	<description>
I've seen the error below several times.

.
It's possibly related to the line [ERROR] (/home/travis/build/ray-project/ray/src/common/io.cc:47: errno: Address already in use) Bind failed for port 48658 that appears in the log, though I'm not sure.
