	<summary>[New scheduler] Hangs with many tasks</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There seems to be a (race condition?) which causes the scheduler to stall indefinitely. I have no way of consistently reproducing it, but running test_actor_pass_by_ref and test_many_fractional_resources hangs often enough that there's definitely a problem.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
