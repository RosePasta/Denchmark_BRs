	<summary>[Dashboard] OSError: [Errno 99] error while attempting to bind on address ('::1', 8265, 0, 0): cannot assign requested address</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am building a Docker image with my branch and am unable to start the dashboard. Node 13.x is installed. The issue appears to be a port conflict. Perhaps there is something already listening on 8265?

		I highly doubt that it is a port problem because dashboard will increase a port number if it is not available before it runs a dashboard process. (For example, if the port is already used, it increases a number to be 8266). There could be many factors that can cause , but I assume it is related to how Docker. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wuisawesome&gt;@wuisawesome&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Any thought?

Does adding --webui-host 0.0.0.0 to ray start work to mitigate this?

I am not using ray start - this is with the tune.run API.

		I had the exact same error. Solved it by adding
ray.init(webui_host='127.0.0.1') at the beginning of the python file.
It seems like hostname '::1' or 'localhost' are sometimes not recognized.

This fixes the issue for me as well. Thank you.

		Could the next person who runs into this issue please post the output of cat /etc/hosts | grep localhost and share your OS as well? It would be very useful for understanding how widespread link local ipv6 addresses are for Ray users.

		I'm in a Docker container.

host OS: macOS Big Sur Beta (20A5343i)
container OS: debian buster (3.8-slim-buster)

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;127.0.0.1	localhost
::1	localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback

		I get the same error in an ubuntu 18.04 container running in jupyterhub on kubernetes. The output of cat /etc/hosts | grep localhost is also
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;127.0.0.1       localhost
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The error went away for when setting . I believe the argument name was changed since &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/semin-park&gt;@semin-park&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I tried to follow your steps but got the following errors
TypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'webui_host'

Has the argument name been changed again? I get the following error.

 I don't think it changed, but can you file a new issue if this is still a problem?
