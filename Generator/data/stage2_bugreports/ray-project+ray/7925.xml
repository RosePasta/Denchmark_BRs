	<summary>[dashboard] Ctrl-C on `ray dashboard` causes weird behavior</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If you run ctrl-c on the console when ray dashboard is running, it causes a forloop to iterate over a bunch of ports.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Ideally, we can just catch keyboard interrupts and terminate correctly.

		I've met the same problem with ray 0.8.6 on my Macbook. Any update on fixing the issue?

		ah yeah, this ended up on my backlog. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/10050&gt;#10050&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should mitigate it by causing the second port attempt to succeed. doing ctrl+c twice quickly will also kill it. i believe the issue is that ssh is hogging the signal and it isn't making its way back to ray.
