&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Python 3.6
TF2.0
ubuntu16.04

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

import ray.experimental.ui as ui ui.task_timeline()
I ran the tutorial code from intel+ray course, but error shows no module named ray.experimental.ui. There is no relevent bug report after searching for google and stackoverflow

		The Intel + Ray course uses a slightly older version of Ray, so the call to the timeline is a bit out of date.
You can generate the timeline by doing ray.timeline(). This generates a JSON file that you can view through chrome://tracing. Soon you'll be able to view it through the Ray UI.
