	<summary>[Tune] PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/labuser' when running a cluster</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to run a cluster of two nodes. Separetely they work fine, but if I am starting them together I am getting this error on both computers.
I am using ray 1.0.0 on Python 3.8.5 on both machines. Seems related to this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/4326&gt;#4326&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but I am using an updated version

		Can you make sure /home/labuser is an accessible folder on all machines?

		<comment id='3' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T04:49:13Z'>
		Thank you for the answer, how can ensure that? Do I need to change the folder permission?
		</comment>
		<comment id='4' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T07:41:36Z'>
		I think you could try something like touch /home/labuser/marker.log on each machine?
		</comment>
		<comment id='5' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T08:03:49Z'>
		So I tried touch /home/labuser/marker.log on one machine and touch /home/tommaso/marker.log on the other. Both worked fine. I tried to start to run again the cluster. Note that on the two computer the users name are different

		Could you get the same absolute path for both machines?
		</comment>
		<comment id='7' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T08:13:07Z'>
		Okey, a news from my side. on the labuser computer I created folder called tommaso in the home filesystem. Now I can bypass the error. So I guess that each node must have the same user and same paths

		<comment id='8' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T08:17:54Z'>
		The thing, is that I am not an admin on a computer, so in general I am forced to use different users

		<comment id='9' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T08:43:40Z'>
		Hmm, do you have a /work or /tmp that you can access?
		</comment>
		<comment id='10' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T08:49:30Z'>
		I have a personal computer with one GPU, where I have a user called tommaso, and then I can access to this computer where I have access to the path /home/labuser. I cannot really do anything that is outside this labuser folder or sudo related

		<comment id='11' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T11:08:49Z'>
		I have access to tmp/, so I can place everything there. Actually I think the best would be having an NFS server accessible from all nodes and configure the logging path there

		<comment id='12' author='TommasoBendinelli' date='2020-11-06T23:40:00Z'>
		Yeah, that sounds good. I'll close this issue for now, as I think this is resolved.
