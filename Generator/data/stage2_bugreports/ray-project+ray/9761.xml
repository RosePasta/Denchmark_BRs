&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
On ubuntu:
These socket connection errors (a) shouldn't happen (b) if they should happen and are normal, they should generate error logs on startup.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
ray.init()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

prints
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;E0728 21:47:24.296782 18264 18264 client_connection.cc:51] Retrying to connect to socket for endpoint /tmp/ray/session_2020-07-28_21-47-22_806574_18264/sockets/raylet (num_attempts = 1, num_retries = 10)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		I'm pretty sure this is a race condition around the creation of the raylet socket: session_latest/sockets/raylet. We should probably just create the socket before initializing the core worker or raylet
