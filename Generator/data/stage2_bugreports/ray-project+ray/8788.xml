		This is a known issue. I actually have an open issue. It happens because some Python threads are still running when cpp core workers are cleaned up, and it tries to access it through a create_profile function. This happens only when it tear downs rarely, so it is not the high priority task for now.

 Oh I see! If you already have an issue for it, let's close it and mark it as a dupe. Which issue is it? I did a quick search and couldn't tell what issue might be already open for it.
