Related to ray dashboard
Similar to other issues with the dashboard it will display for a second and then disappear. In the inspector i find this log:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;react-dom.production.min.js:209 TypeError: Cannot read property 'find' of null
    at GRAM.tsx:119

react-dom.production.min.js:209 TypeError: Cannot read property 'toFixed' of null
    at dn (GPU.tsx:92)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am unsure what aspects of my configuration are causing an issue, its older hardware and an older ubuntu version so that could be the issue.

		Nevermind! Installed nvidia drivers and restarted. This solved the issue
