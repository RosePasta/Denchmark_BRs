	<summary>[Metrics] Metric.record without default tag set doesn't error.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The following doesn't throw any error but it should, because metrics without the tag value cannot be recorded:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;
In [5]: error_counter = metrics.Count( 
   ...:             "fake_serve_backend_error_counter", 
   ...:             description=("The number of exceptions that have " 
   ...:                          "occurred in the backend."), 
   ...:             tag_keys=("backend", ))                             

In [6]: error_counter.record(9003)    

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
