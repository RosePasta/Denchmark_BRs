	<summary>Local scheduler fails silently after starting too many workers</summary>
	<description>
The maximum number of forked processes is given by RLIMIT_NPROC. After forking, we need to check whether the PID returned is -1. If the error returned is EAGAIN, we should warn and possibly kill the driver that we cannot start anymore workers.
We should also increase RLIMIT_NPROC on local scheduler startup.
