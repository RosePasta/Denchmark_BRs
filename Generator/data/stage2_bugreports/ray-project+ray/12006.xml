	<summary>[autoscaler] Number of target nodes is incorrect</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


ray 1.0.1
kubernetes autoscaler

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I run this script of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/simon-mo&gt;@simon-mo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 twice: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/simon-mo/7b0dd033b2f12c72c75ce0cfd0c664d7&gt;https://gist.github.com/simon-mo/7b0dd033b2f12c72c75ce0cfd0c664d7&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

A worker is scaled, but the number of target nodes is incorrect:

It should report .
Although the reporting is wrong, the actor and worker keep running, so the worker is not scaled down...
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		We replaced the legacy autoscaler backend recently (it will be released in 1.0.2). I'm closing this issue for now since it's likely fixed in the new backend; feel free to re-open if this isn't the case.
