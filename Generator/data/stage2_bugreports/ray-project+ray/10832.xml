	<summary>[RLlib] PPO PyTorch - Trainer config option `vf_share_layers` does not get passed into model config.</summary>
	<description>
For PPO on PyTorch, the vf_share_layers config key is never passed into the Model's config, so it's value is always ignored. For Conv2D Models, this was only a minor issue before 0.8.7 as our PyTorch Conv2D stack did not support a separate value branch anyways.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
