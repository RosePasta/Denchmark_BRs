	<summary>Dashboard should use the correct actor states.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Dashboard doc &amp; code should use newly introduced GCS actor states.
from gcs.proto
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  enum ActorState {
    // Actor info is registered in GCS. But its dependencies are not ready.
    DEPENDENCIES_UNREADY = 0;
    // Actor local dependencies are ready. This actor is being created.
    PENDING_CREATION = 1;
    // Actor is alive.
    ALIVE = 2;
    // Actor is dead, now being restarted.
    // After reconstruction finishes, the state will become alive again.
    RESTARTING = 3;
    // Actor is already dead and won't be restarted.
    DEAD = 4;
  }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
