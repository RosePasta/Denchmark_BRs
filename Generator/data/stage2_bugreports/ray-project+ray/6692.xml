&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am trying to install ray from source following &lt;denchmark-link:https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#building-ray-from-source&gt;the instructions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on macOS Catalina version 10.15.1.
I should mention that I am skipping the dashboard building in the instructions.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Infos&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Ray installed from (source or binary): master version from git
Ray version: master
Python version: Python 3.7.4
OS : macOS Catalina version 10.15.1

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Error&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The command to reproduce is .
For this issue I am using a freshly created conda env.
The out is quite long so you can find it on pastebin &lt;denchmark-link:https://pastebin.com/nM4xh9GD&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but the error seems to start from line 223:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; ERROR: /private/var/tmp/_bazel_giulia/4233393433bb21b78a4932ac1f6cb7ae/external/com_google_googletest/BUILD.bazel:55:1: C++ compilation of rule '@com_google_googletest//:gtest' failed (Exit 1) cc_wrapper.sh failed:
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What I have tried so far&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


New conda environment
Using the --user flag
Installing Xcode.
Reinsatlling bazel from their website.
Following this issue (even tho my error is quite different):

deleting and cloning the repo again + deleting pip cache
using brew install openssl bisonz
using brew install thrift


Following this other issue related to bazel i tried to brew uninstall protobuf

		Finally understood what the problem was.
I was using Ray as a submodule in a custom repo, which was causing some kind of problems.
Moving ray in its own directory solved the issue.
