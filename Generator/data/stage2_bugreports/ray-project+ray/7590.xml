	<summary>New pickle5 Error breaks examples</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Versions&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Latest ray on master
numpy==1.16.3

Error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;╰─ python hyperband_example.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "hyperband_example.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    import ray
  File "/Users/rliaw/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/__init__.py", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
    raise ImportError("Ray must be imported before pickle5 because Ray "
ImportError: Ray must be imported before pickle5 because Ray requires a specific version of pickle5 (which is packaged along with Ray).
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run python ray/python/ray/tune/examples/hyperband_examples.py.
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		What pickle5 version were you using? I uninstalled pickle5 and it seemed to work for me.

		I understand; but I'm saying I had a separate installation of pickle5 and removing it fixed my issue.

		oh i see. I don't have a separate installation of pickle5 so it's whatever end up in the bundle.
