	<summary>[ray] [tune] __ray_terminate__() blocks computing units</summary>
	<description>
When running a python pipeline on different processing units using ray, the function
 ray_MyTrainableClass:__ray_terminate__()
does not terminate (!) and therefore blocks the corresponding unit. This leads the pipeline to fail, as ultimately there is no remaining units available.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
System:

		Hi Nina, can you update to the latest version of Ray? (0.8 or even better, latest wheels)

		If that doesn't work could you also please provide a script that reproduces the issue?
