	<summary>`ray.init` on WSL does not work</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS): 0.8
This was reported in Modin. See discussion here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.modin.org/t/problem-when-running-code-with-modin-1-time/90/2&gt;https://discuss.modin.org/t/problem-when-running-code-with-modin-1-time/90/2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This is related to, but not the same as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/3059&gt;#3059&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. See logs below
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
import ray
ray.init()
Logs below:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-01-23 14:09:01,315 INFO resource_spec.py:216 â€“ Starting Ray with 30.32 GiB memory available for workers and up to 15.16 GiB for objects. You can adjust these settings with ray.init(memory=, object_store_memory=).

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		I've found a workaround. You need to downgrade psutil to at least version 4.3.1. Then ray.init() starts without difficulty.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;pip install --upgrade psutil==4.3.1
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi, I commented on the original issue reported in modin, reported here by devin.
I now tried to uninstall all of the above and then install them in the proposed order.
Result is basically the same, still core dumping, with the addition of a new INFO print before:

 This could be a firewall/network issue. Could you please review your security settings if your firewall is blocking (e.g. temporarily disconnect from the internet and turn off the desktop firewall and re-run Ray locally)?
I have attached my Ray output for your reference. Despite the protocol error Ray successfully completes the processing.

		Hello,
I had the same issue. It is running now on windows using wsl.
Here is what I did (as far as I remember).

updated windows to 1909
executed some of these commands https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
uninstalled Ubuntu
isntalled Ubuntu 18.04
installed Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
made python3.8 environment with conda
conda install anaconda
conda install tensorflow
pip install ray[tune]

Hope this helps you guys.

I'm not sure - I never had the problem but also didn't try any other configuration. I just thought it might help in solving the issue.
