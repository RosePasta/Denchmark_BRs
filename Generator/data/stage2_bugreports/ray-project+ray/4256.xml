	<summary>The many_tasks.py long running stress test crashes after an hour.</summary>
	<description>
The relevant test is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/ci/long_running_tests/workloads/many_tasks.py&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/ci/long_running_tests/workloads/many_tasks.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The issue appears to be that the node runs out of memory because the first raylet has many GB of messages buffered and waiting to be written to the other raylets. I determined this by looking at debug_state.txt.
