	<summary>[docker] Install docker by default if necessary</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Consider a yaml like this (this is from release testing
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;cluster_name: ray-release-microbenchmark
min_workers: 0
max_workers: 0
target_utilization_fraction: 0.8
idle_timeout_minutes: 5

# Cloud-provider specific configuration.
provider:
    type: aws
    region: us-west-2
    availability_zone: us-west-2a
auth:
    ssh_user: ubuntu

head_node:
    InstanceType: m4.16xlarge
    ImageId: ami-06d51e91cea0dac8d  # Ubuntu 18.04
    BlockDeviceMappings:
        - DeviceName: /dev/sda1
          Ebs:
              VolumeSize: 150

worker_nodes:
    InstanceType: m5.large
    ImageId: ami-06d51e91cea0dac8d  # Ubuntu 18.04
    BlockDeviceMappings:
        - DeviceName: /dev/sda1
          Ebs:
              VolumeSize: 150

    # Run workers on spot by default. Comment this out to use on-demand.
    InstanceMarketOptions:
        MarketType: spot

# List of shell commands to run to set up nodes.
setup_commands:
    # Install latest TensorFlow
    - echo set-window-option -g mouse on &gt; ~/.tmux.conf
    - echo 'termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@' &gt; ~/.screenrc

# Custom commands that will be run on the head node after common setup.
head_setup_commands: 
    # Install Anaconda.
    - wget --quiet https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh || true
    - bash Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/anaconda3 || true
    - echo 'export PATH="$HOME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
    - pip install -U pip 
    - conda uninstall -y terminado

# Custom commands that will be run on worker nodes after common setup.
worker_setup_commands: []

# Command to start ray on the head node. You don't need to change this.
head_start_ray_commands: []

# Command to start ray on worker nodes. You don't need to change this.
worker_start_ray_commands: []
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It makes no mention of docker, but will fail because docker is not installed. This is a regression and we should install docker by default if we need to use it.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
