	<summary>[Serve] Regression: HTTP Server multiplexing on same node no longer works</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Setting num_nodes &gt; 1 will fail the long running test because it tries to spawn multiple http server per node. We should either have an option to start only one http server, or fail softly.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/release/long_running_tests/workloads/serve.py&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/release/long_running_tests/workloads/serve.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
