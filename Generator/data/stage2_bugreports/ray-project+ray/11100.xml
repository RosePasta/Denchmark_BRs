Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
ray_version:0.8.7
python:3.6.7
torch:1.6.0
torchvision:0.2.1
os:ubuntu16.04.5 LTS
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Are you using ray_version 0.8.7 while trying to use the master branch examples? If so, consider switching to the 0.8.7 branch and running those examples.
