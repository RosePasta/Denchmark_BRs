	<summary>[autoscaler] Ray submit with docker doesn't rsync the script to the container</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Debian GNU/Linux 9.8 (stretch) on GCP
Ray installed from (source or binary): source (5bfcfa8)
Ray version: master - 5bfcfa8 (0.7.0.dev0)
Python version: 3.7
Exact command to reproduce:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ray up -y minimal.yaml  # with a docker image of the master build of Ray
ray submit --docker minimal.yaml hello_ray.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

If I run submit without --docker then the worker can execute the specified script from ~, but when --docker is set, it throws:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python: can't open file '/root/hello_ray.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When the docker run is called in the initialization phase, there doesn't seem to be any attached volumes, so I guess a shared location between the host and the container should resolve this, but there could be better ways as well.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I can include full logs if necessary.

		Sorry for the late reply.
A good fix here would be to use  if using  (and implicitly ): &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/&gt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I can probably get to this in a couple days, but if you're interested in a contributing a fix, I'd be more than glad to help fix up the PR and get it merged.

		Thanks for looking into this. Sorry, I could do it probably next week, but definitely not in the next few days...

		Oops, this should be addressed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/4403&gt;#4403&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
