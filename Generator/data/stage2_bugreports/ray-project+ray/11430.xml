	<summary>[Autoscaler] Unmanaged node off-by-one error</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Consider a cluster with utilization_fraction: 1.0 and an unmanaged node.
target_num_workers() == 1 because we receive load metrics from the unmanaged node.
But num_workers = self.workers() + num_pending, and self.workers() already filters out the unmanaged node.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
