		It's due to the softlinking from the installation dir e.g. "[anaconda]/envs/[your env name]/site-packages/ray/..." into the local git clone.
Two possible solutions are:

remove these links always before making any changes to the pip installation (also before upgrading to e.g. latest wheel).
do the pip (un)installations first, then rollback the current working tree in the local git clone: git checkout -f master (make sure you commit any important changes beforehand, though!).
