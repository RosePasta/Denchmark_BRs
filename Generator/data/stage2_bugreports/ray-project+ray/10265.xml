	<summary>parametric action example 'PPO' algo does not work</summary>
	<description>
for the example the library gives 'parametric action example', I found when having the run as default 'PPO', it failed. after printing out, it looks like when do batch prediction process, the output of model is nan, is it because the gradient explodes?

   Both my script and this example has the same issue.  I run this example with policy as PPO and using torch framework. All other parameters remain the same. The bug is "RuntimeError: invalid multinomial distribution (encountering probability entry &lt; 0)",  after further investigation, I found the model prediction results are all nan value. When using DQN as policy, it works. When using PPO, I saw this bug.

		I see, this seems to be a torch only issue (this is what I was missing). This might fix it: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/10168&gt;#10168&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , can you give it a try?
