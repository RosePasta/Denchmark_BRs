	<summary>[dashboard] [autoscaler] Dashboard does not show actors once workers are autoscaled</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


ray 1.0.0rc2
kubernetes autoscaling

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Start an autoscaling cluster
Go to dashboard -&gt; This works
Deploy some ray actors and wait for autoscaling to deploy the necessary workers

Result: The ray dashboard does show the newly added workers, but does not show any actors deployed on the workers.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

BR, Pieterjan

		Hmm, that's interesting. This could be because the machine view leans on PSUtil to get information about the Ray workers and what they're executing. Perhaps this isn't working correctly with Kubernetes at the moment. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ijrsvt&gt;@ijrsvt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you know off hand whether things like PSUtil work correctly when autoscaling using kubernetes?

 Just to make this clear: Without autoscaling, by deploying a ray cluster manually on kubernetes, the dashboard works!

		Still having issues with it.
This shows up as plain text in the dashboard in the latest nightly, when autoscaling:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/app/miniconda3/envs/regulator/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray/new_dashboard/utils.py", line 351, in _update_cache response = task.result() File "/app/miniconda3/envs/regulator/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray/new_dashboard/modules/stats_collector/stats_collector_head.py", line 89, in get_all_nodes all_node_details = await DataOrganizer.get_all_node_details() File "/app/miniconda3/envs/regulator/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray/new_dashboard/datacenter.py", line 193, in get_all_node_details for node_id in DataSource.nodes.keys() File "/app/miniconda3/envs/regulator/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray/new_dashboard/datacenter.py", line 193, in &lt;listcomp&gt; for node_id in DataSource.nodes.keys() File "/app/miniconda3/envs/regulator/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray/new_dashboard/datacenter.py", line 141, in get_node_info node_stats["viewData"], KeyError: 'viewData'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Probably a different issue... But dashboard/autoscaling seems very untested too me :/

		Also
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;SyntaxError: Unexpected token I in JSON at position 4
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When using autoscaling in ray 1.0.1
