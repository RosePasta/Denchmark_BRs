	<summary>[GCS Actor Management] `test_dead_actors` release test is flaky. GCS fails with check failures.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18510752/88437114-9d9acb00-cdba-11ea-9318-8336fdb40462.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Tests occasionally failed with check failures. There must be a hidden race condition here. Could be related to flaky test_multi_node.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run test_dead_actors.py with the specified cluster configuration.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 Maybe just removing check there is sufficient? I remember I saw the same race condition in the past I couldn't reproduce after a certain point. Probably the same thing.

 You can assign this issue to me. I have encountered it before.
