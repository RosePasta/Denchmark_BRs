	<summary>problem with centos 7.3 build?</summary>
	<description>
The build looks fine until I do a ray.init().  This is with Anaconda3-4.4.0. At the end you can see I have no problem importing redis or numpy manually:

		I suspect the problem is the following.
You are starting Python and running Ray using the binary opt/anaconda3/bin/python. However, Ray is starting a bunch of python workers, and it is just running the python command, so it is finding whichever version of python that which python returns. And that version of Python on your machine probably doesn't have numpy or redis installed.
If that's the case, you could work around this by doing export PATH=opt/anaconda3/bin:$PATH so that which python returns opt/anaconda3/bin/python.
But really, we should fix this by starting the workers using the same version of Python that you are using (and not just running the python executable). I'll look into this, I don't think it will be very difficult.
