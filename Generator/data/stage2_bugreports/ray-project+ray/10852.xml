 # What is the problem?
ObjectStoreFullError:Failed to put object into object store
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ray:0.8.6
Ubuntu:18.04

Sorry , my script has so many dependencies.But the bug is easy to describe.
When I try to use PBT to train my models , I found the 8 trails occupy more and more memory.And finally,raise memory error.
I think the reason is the 'tempfile' package make many checkpoints in memory .For example , in 40 epoch ,maybe a trail have made 40 checkpoints in tempfile , so the memory crash.
I can not confirm what caused this error , thanks for your any help.
