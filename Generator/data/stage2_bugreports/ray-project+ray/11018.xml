	<summary>[Placement Group] Not working with @ray.remote</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Although @ray.remote contains an argument for placement group, it doesn't work. We should either remove it or allow it. (placement_group_capture_child_task)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		I think we shouldn't allow adding placement group in @ray.remote. What do you think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ffbin&gt;@ffbin&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
?
