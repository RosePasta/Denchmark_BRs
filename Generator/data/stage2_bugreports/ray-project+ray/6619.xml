	<summary>Node didn't show in web UI after instantiate ray actor</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
Ray installed from (source or binary): binary
Ray version: 0.8.0
Python version: 3.6.7

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have a Keras model instantiate inside a class to predict something and I'm using ray to create ray actors of the classes. Before I create the ray actors, there are still worker that is in idle position based on web UI. After I created the ray actor, number of workers slowly decreased and finally all gone (I created for each workers one ray actor). But, if I check using htop, the workers are still there running className.__init__(). I already installed all package for ray such as psutil. setproctitle, aiohttp, libgcc. The problem however didn't show if I'm using ray version 0.7.6.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Source code / logs&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

# here is script for instantiate the ray actors
from script_name import className
import ray
ray.init()

className = ray.remote(className)

# parameter i is used for set which core is used for the ray actors
# there is a 64 cores CPU in my computer
models = [ className._remote(kwargs={'i':i},num_cpus=1) for i in range(64)]

# some command after here

 Is this still an issue on the latest release/master? If not, could you please post a fully runnable reproducible script?
