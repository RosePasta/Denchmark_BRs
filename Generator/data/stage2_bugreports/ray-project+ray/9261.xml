	<summary>Reported KL divergence negative in PPO [rllib]</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Is it possible for reported KL values in PPO to be negative?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15848908/86303118-da6b0c00-bbd8-11ea-98d4-59cd601ad26b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I thought that the reported number was supposed to be the expectation over states of the KL-divergences of the action probabilities at each state.  So it shouldn't be negative, right?

Ray 0.8.5
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Unsure what causes such low KL divergences, since this is supposed to mean that the strategy is changing very little between iterations; other environments I've tried within PPO examples don't seem to have this issue.
However, reported relative frequency (e.g. # of times agent chose this action divided by the total # of steps) of a particular action being chosen isn't staying constant despite the KL divergence staying low.

If it helps, you can clone the repo I've been using here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wuwuz/SquirRL/tree/master/MultiAgent&gt;https://github.com/wuwuz/SquirRL/tree/master/MultiAgent&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And you can run it with python3 bitcoin_game.py --alphas .3875 --OSM 1 --workers (your workers setting) --players 2 --save_path none
Edit: Is there perhaps something funky going on with np.inf's?  I implemented a parametric action space, following the example

		Continuous distribution can provide negative entropy.

		(1) Sorry, I should've mentioned that the action space I used is discrete, so that shouldn't be a concern.
(2) Differential entropy can be negative, but differential KL divergence cannot be negative.  Check out the &lt;denchmark-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs%27_inequality&gt;proof&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (under the "alternative proofs" section).  This proof is also valid for continuous distributions.
