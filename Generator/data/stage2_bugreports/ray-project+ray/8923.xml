	<summary>[ray] Raylet logs is blasting output</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is your question?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Can we improve the logging mechanisms and output for ray.init?
With such verbose output, it is hard to seamlessly integrate Ray into a library that actually cares about output.

		This isn't the first time this has regressed. We should add a unit test checking the output.

		Cannot reproduce it from 0.8.6 so far. I will remove release blocker. But we should definitely fix this before 0.8.7, so I will keep P0

		Could we use subprocess to run and check the output of a noop ray script? I
think we have a couple tests that do that already for testing multiple
drivers, for instance.
