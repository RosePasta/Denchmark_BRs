&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

test_multi_node.py::test_multi_driver_logging hangs when GCS actor management is on.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run test_multi_node.py::test_multi_driver_logging

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

i don't think this test should deadlock (always a chance i messed it up).
i wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that this test uses detached async actors which block/wakeup from different drivers (see test_utils.Semaphore)

		It seems to me that there could be some unexpected race condition when you use Semaphore, but we cannot be sure until we actually debug it.
