	<summary>[autoscaler] Ray cluster start / re-start fails under certain conditions</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When restarting a cluster, and - ray stop; ray start are executed, it seems to create a race condition and often fails indicating ray is already running... rectified for now by putting - sleep 5 in between, but maybe better way to handle that.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 This must've been resolved in the nightly. Can you try? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/11735&gt;#11735&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
