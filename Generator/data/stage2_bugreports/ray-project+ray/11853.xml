&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running the existing https://ray.io/#serve sample and the newer one: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/serve/examples/doc/quickstart_class.py throw errors.
Focusing on the newer one, here's the full traceback:

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
python serve.py where serve.py is the example file here: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/serve/examples/doc/quickstart_class.py
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
^^ Tried this, but get 404:
