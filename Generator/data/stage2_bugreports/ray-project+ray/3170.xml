	<summary>Trials always fail with RayGetError</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Ubuntu 16.04
Ray installed from (source or binary): binary
Ray version: a221f55
Python version: 3.6.5

I run experiments with a lot of trails, but trials fail after run for a while.
All failed trials raise ray.worker.RayGetError in different places of the code, but all are related to Actor.
Here are some samples:

		Invalid return value: likely worker died or was killed while executing the task.
Hey this usually means that the worker crashed unexpectedly without returning an exception, sometimes due to running out of memory. Some tips to debug this: check out /tmp/raylogs/worker-*, or run dmesg to see the kernel log.
This might also be relevant: &lt;denchmark-link:https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html#troubleshooting&gt;https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html#troubleshooting&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If this doesn't turn up anything, do you have a self-contained script that can reproduce this problem?

		Ok the segfault is definitely the problem then. Any idea what causes that
to happen? A reproduction script would be great.

You can also capture a core dump by running ulimit -c unlimited to enable
that for your session, and looking for core files in the logs dir (I think?)

		Sorry, I think I mistook the output of dmesg. The segfault error was generated previously, not when the RayGetError occurs.
For other observations, I confirm again.
What I am doing is to implement &lt;denchmark-link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400&gt;MAML&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on Ray. For now, I can only reproduce the error using the whole code I have written, rather than a simple script.
If convenient, please check out the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/llan-ml/maml-on-ray&gt;code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and run . The code works well in a single node mode (i.e., ).
But when distributed, (there are two nodes in my case), the error occurs after about 70 iterations for a trial. Also, when there are some failed trials, the console just stops printing anything.

		Hmm actually it looks like the main issue might be that the raylet backend is falling behind. This line means that the node is sending heartbeats too far apart:
W1101 16:14:11.769891 78905 node_manager.cc:232] Last heartbeat was sent 3974 ms ago
If the heartbeats get delayed by too much, the node will be assumed to be dead, which is probably why you're not seeing any more output.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/llan-ml&gt;@llan-ml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, are those the full logs from the node manager? Can you send the rest if not?

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/llan-ml&gt;@llan-ml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Btw, as a workaround you can use an older version of Ray (0.5.3) with pip install ray==0.5.3.

 The error happens suddenly just following the normal printing, and then the driver process is still hanging up without exit. I also check out the files in /tmp/ray/session/*, they are almost the same with the above log samples.

 I install ray==0.5.3 and then replace the files of Tune and RLlib with the latest ones. The distributed tuning works normally now.

		I ran a tune experiment again, and found several problems:

RayGetError still occurs.

Some trials were running slowly, mainly because a trial may consume a lot of time at some iteration.

The building of trials quite slowly. My experiment with 50 trials took several minutes to build all 50 trials.

It seems that the s3 version I used is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/80f63696ac250aa2b3342ddf26c7e94ade399bdb&gt;80f6369&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		If the cluster is still healthy, then the crash is probably in the application code. Usual things to check are memory usage, resource contention, etc?
The slow building is weird though, perhaps use ray stack to determine what is going on during the building.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is 50000 not 50 though right?

, and the tuning works now without . However, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/80f63696ac250aa2b3342ddf26c7e94ade399bdb&gt;80f6369&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 still raises this error. Perhaps some commits between these two commits solve this issue.
