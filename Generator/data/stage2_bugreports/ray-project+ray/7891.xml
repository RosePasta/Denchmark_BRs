	<summary>Incorrect Title for Failed Tasks</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When a task fails, the process title of the failed task remains. This appears in both the dashboard and to the OS (htop).
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Python: 3.7
OS: MacOS 10.15.4
Ray: Latest Master
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
ray.init()
@ray.remote
def fail():
    import NonRealModule
fail.remote()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then run htop and "__main__.fail()" will remain even after the function errors and returns.
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
