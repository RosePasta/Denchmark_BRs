	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

in check_import_order.py we check if codes import ray before importing psutil/setproctitle using the line number we found in single file.
but the line number always point to the last line the import at. for example we have  real  import ray in file header and another import ray in functions like run_string_as_driver. we need add extra but unnecessary import setproctitle if we have a import setproctitle in file header. like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
import setproctitle

....

def funciton_udf(file):
    driver = run_string_as_driver("""
import ray
import setproctitle (this one is not necessary but we must add it, otherwise the check import order will throw a check failed message)
.....
ray.init()
.....
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
just use run_string_as_driver in any file that already has psutil/setproctitle imported.
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
