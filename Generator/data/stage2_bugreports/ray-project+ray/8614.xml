	<summary>[rllib] PyTorch and SampleAsync validation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

PyTorch is supposed to be thread-safe, as long as you don't write a tensor using multiple threads. Please see &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/is-pytorch-supposed-to-be-thread-safe/36540/2&gt;https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/is-pytorch-supposed-to-be-thread-safe/36540/2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It might be worth removing the validation of sample_async and use_pytorch for A3C (and maybe others?).
Ray Version 0.9.0dev (but this applies to any ray version actually)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
