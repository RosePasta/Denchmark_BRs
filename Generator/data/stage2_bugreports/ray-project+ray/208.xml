	<summary>Bug when multiple wait requests involve the same object ID.</summary>
	<description>
The following hangs (one of the calls to ray.wait inside of g  hangs).
import ray
import time

ray.init(num_workers=3)

@ray.remote
def g(l):
  ray.wait([l[0]])

@ray.remote
def f(x):
  time.sleep(x)

x = f.remote(5)

ray.get([g.remote([x]), g.remote([x])])
The issue is that in plasma_manager.c, when we process a new object ID and call update_object_wait_requests, we iterate over a list (the utarray object_wait_reqs-&gt;wait_requests) of wait requests involving that object ID. For some of the wait requests, we return to the client by calling return_from_wait, which removes an element from object_wait_reqs-&gt;wait_requests. Since we delete an element from the array while iterating over it, we end up not iterating over the full list and not returning for all of the wait requests.
