	<summary>PicklingError in ray serve</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I have started exploring ray serve for model deployment and tried few ray serve examples but all are failing due to the below error.
PicklingError: Can't pickle &lt;cyfunction _process_class.._pydantic_post_init at 0x7fc08b644ad0&gt;: attribute lookup _pydantic_post_init on pydantic.dataclasses failed
I am using Ray version : 1.1.0 and tried running on both Linux and windows.
Request you to please suggest a way forward to resolve this issue.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
I have followed the ray serve scikit-learn example from the ray documentation
&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/master/serve/deployment.html&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/master/serve/deployment.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Hi, sorry you ran into this--this should be fixed in the master branch.  Alternatively, you can also try running pip install -U pydantic&lt;1.7.  Does that help?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jxz542189&gt;@jxz542189&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, did that command not fix it for you?  Are you still seeing the issue on the latest master?  It should have been fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/11622&gt;#11622&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
