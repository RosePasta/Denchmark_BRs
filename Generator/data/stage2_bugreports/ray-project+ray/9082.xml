	<summary>[core] Repeated warning about Worker log file creation</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

On ray.init(), I get the following printed 16 times (one per worker it looks like).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(pid=&lt;XXXX&gt;) Could not create log file: File exists
(pid=&lt;XXXX&gt;) COULD NOT CREATE LOGFILE '20200621-222001.&lt;XXXX&gt;'!
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Python: 3.6.10
OS: MacOS 10.15.5
Latest Ray version (06/21/2020)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
