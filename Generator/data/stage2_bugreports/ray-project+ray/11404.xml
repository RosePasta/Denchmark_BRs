	<summary>[Serve] 60 second examples don't work if run as .py file</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The two scripts at &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/master/serve/&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/master/serve/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 print the expected result (, ) if pasted into , but not when run as a  file.  Maybe everyone just pastes examples into their interpreter, but I wonder if this could be a bad first impression for those users that try to save them and run them.
Example:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;❯ python quickstart_class.py

❯
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ray 1.0.0, but also on master.  py3.6, MacOS
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Linked above, but here's a paste:
from ray import serve
import requests

client = serve.start()

def echo(flask_request):
    return "hello " + flask_request.args.get("name", "serve!")


client.create_backend("hello", echo)
client.create_endpoint("hello", backend="hello", route="/hello")

requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello").text
# &gt; "hello serve!"
from ray import serve
import requests

client = serve.start()

class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def __call__(self, flask_request):
        return {"current_counter": self.count}


client.create_backend("counter", Counter)
client.create_endpoint("counter", backend="counter", route="/counter")

requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:8000/counter").json()
# &gt; {"current_counter": self.count}

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		can you fix it by wrapping the requests in a for loop and print a shutting down near the end?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;for _ in range(10):
    requests.get("....")

print("Shutting down")
client.shutdown()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This is embarrassing, I just realized we don't call print() in the script, but when pasted into ipython the value of the last line is always printed.  I'll just wrap the last line in print().  This is what's done in the examples on the front page of the Ray docs, so it'll be consistent.
