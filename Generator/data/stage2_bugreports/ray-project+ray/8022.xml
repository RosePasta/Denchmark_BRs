	<summary>[Python] Using Ray driver in multiple threads causes KeyError in Redis client.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Using a single Ray driver across multiple threads can result in s being thrown within the Redis client, due to the Redis connection pool &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/issues/1138&gt;not being very threadsafe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/app/descarteslabs/services/workbench/app/image.binary.runfiles/requirements_py3_pypi__ray_0_9_0_dev0/ray-0.9.0.dev0.data/purelib/ray/remote_function.py", line 95, in _remote_proxy
    return self._remote(args=args, kwargs=kwargs)
  File "/app/descarteslabs/services/workbench/app/image.binary.runfiles/requirements_py3_pypi__ray_0_9_0_dev0/ray-0.9.0.dev0.data/purelib/ray/remote_function.py", line 176, in _remote
    worker.function_actor_manager.export(self)
  File "/app/descarteslabs/services/workbench/app/image.binary.runfiles/requirements_py3_pypi__ray_0_9_0_dev0/ray-0.9.0.dev0.data/purelib/ray/function_manager.py", line 152, in export
    "max_calls": remote_function._max_calls
  File "/app/descarteslabs/services/workbench/app/image.binary.runfiles/requirements_py3_pypi__redis_3_3_11/redis/client.py", line 2761, in hmset
    return self.execute_command('HMSET', name, *items)
  File "/app/descarteslabs/services/workbench/app/image.binary.runfiles/requirements_py3_pypi__redis_3_3_11/redis/client.py", line 848, in execute_command
    pool.release(conn)
  File "/app/descarteslabs/services/workbench/app/image.binary.runfiles/requirements_py3_pypi__redis_3_3_11/redis/connection.py", line 1114, in release
    self._in_use_connections.remove(connection)
KeyError: Connection&lt;host=10.90.9.86,port=6380,db=0&gt;
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

A &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/pull/1270&gt;fix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 was merged and released, so updating to redis&gt;=3.4.0 should do the trick.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
