&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
The report logs output the following and prometheus endpoint return 500

    assert (len(tag_values) == len(label_keys))

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
I didn't get to find the exactly reproducible case but it involves adding and removing serve cluster, and adding and killing named actors, all attached to existing Ray cluster. I will spend more time to figure it out
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
