	<summary>[RLlib] PrioritizedReplayBuffer raises  "IndexError: list index out of range" from SegmentTree</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Docker image python:3.7

Python 3.7.5
Linux (Debian Buster)
Ray 0.8.1

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;docker run -it python:3.7 bash
pip install ray[rllib] pandas
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(Another issue: Pandas is missing from install_requires, needed manual installation.)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from ray.rllib.optimizers.replay_buffer import PrioritizedReplayBuffer as PRB

buffer_size = 4096
prb = PRB(buffer_size,alpha=0.4)

for _ in range(buffer_size):
    prb.add(obs_t=0,
            action=0,
            reward=0,
            obs_tp1=0,
            done=0,
            weight=0.5)

prb.sample(1,beta=0.5)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Output

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reason&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

end (upper bound) of  SegmentTree.reduce is "inclusive", but ReplayBuffer._sample_proportional calls with "exclusive" upper bound style (through SumSegmentTree.sum), resulting out of index error.
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

SegmentTree.reduce



ray/rllib/optimizers/segment_tree.py


        Lines 75 to 76
      in
      b6233df






 if end is None: 



 end = self._capacity - 1 





&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

PrioritizedReplayBuffer._sample_proportional



ray/rllib/optimizers/replay_buffer.py


         Line 167
      in
      b6233df






 mass = random.random() * self._it_sum.sum(0, len(self._storage)) 





&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

SumSegmentTree.sum



ray/rllib/optimizers/segment_tree.py


         Line 103
      in
      b6233df






 return super(SumSegmentTree, self).reduce(start, end)

This bug has been fixed along with other issues related to our SegmentTree implementation in this PR here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/7555&gt;#7555&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We also added detailed sampling test cases for our PR-buffer to make sure prioritized sampling works as expected.
Again, thanks for bringing this to our attention!
Closing the issue.
