	<summary>`load_code_from_local` is broken?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS): Latest, Linux
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This just breaks
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import numpy as np
import time
import ray
import ray.tune
import ray.tune.track

ray.init(ignore_reinit_error=True,
    memory=2000 * 1024 * 1024,
    object_store_memory=200 * 1024 * 1024,
    driver_object_store_memory=100 * 1024 * 1024,
    load_code_from_local=True
)
    
def somefun(config):
    ray.tune.track.log(something=0, test="asdf")
    return res

ray.tune.run(somefun)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Here is the error raised:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;020-03-27 19:46:58,007	WARNING worker.py:1081 -- Traceback (most recent call last):

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

    raise value
ray.exceptions.RayActorError: The actor died unexpectedly before finishing this task.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is this being used correctly? Otherwise, the error seems to be misleading.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		The load_code_from_local may never worked for ray.tune, because ray.tune always wraps a python function to class WrappedTrackFunc, and WrappedTrackFunc is a dynamic generated class defined in a function which can't be loaded from source.

		Can we please raise a better error message?
