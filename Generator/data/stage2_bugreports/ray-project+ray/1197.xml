	<summary>build error: cannot find pyarrow  build dir</summary>
	<description>
The pyarrow build directory is found by searching for the substring lib. The path it checks is absolute. If lib exists in the path to the pyarrow build dir, then you may get this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;+ PYARROW_BUILD_LIB_DIR=/home/elibol/dev/ray/src/thirdparty/arrow/python/build

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If you run into this issue, a temporary workaround is to replace line 99 in src/thirdparty/build_thirdparty.sh with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;TEMP_PWD=`pwd`
cd $TP_DIR/arrow/python/build
PYARROW_BUILD_LIB_DIR="$TP_DIR/arrow/python/build/$(find ./ -maxdepth 1 -type d -print | grep -m1 'lib')"
cd $TEMP_PWD
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Good catch! Grepping for lib was a hack that we should probably get rid of anyway.
