	<summary>[rllib] YAMLLoadWarning in ray/python/ray/rllib/utils/from_config.py</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I run atari with ppo I see the following warning being printed many times:
ray/python/ray/rllib/utils/from_config.py:134: YAMLLoadWarning: calling yaml.load() without Loader=... is deprecated, as the default Loader is unsafe. Please read https://msg.pyyaml.org/load for full details.
obj = yaml.load(type_)
I didn't see this warning maybe a week ago or so when I had last pulled the latest changes from the master branch.  Note that changing yaml.load() to yaml.safe_load() causes the warning to go away.

python 3.7.6
ray: 0.9.0.dev0 (built from source rev &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/0db2046b0a35d5ce7a411489a9d7d14ee254d15d&gt;0db2046&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
OS: Ubuntu 18.04.03 LTS
torch: 1.4.0
tensorflow: 1.1.5
PyYAML 5.3
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
rllib train -f tuned_example/atari-ppo.yaml
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
