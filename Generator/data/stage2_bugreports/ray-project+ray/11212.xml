	<summary>[tune] Incomplete schedulers dict in tune.py</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The _SCHEDULERS dict in tune/tune.py only has 4 of the available schedulers. As a result only these 4 are available in rllib's train.py which uses the dict (in the _make_schedulers function)
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ray 0.8.5, but still present in master.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
See rllib/train.py, which uses the _make_schedulers function from tune.py.
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
