	<summary>[rllib] Apex DDPG gpu utilization</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
While using Ray Apex DDPG (), I see one strange thing: even if config is with  I don't see any gpu utilisation in nvidia-smi:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7606451/42943917-e0bcb5b6-8b6c-11e8-8b44-76015c5c9d4e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Why is that? By the docs, I assume to see 100% utilisation, cause the network should be updated in the background in something like training thread, is't it?
PS. sorry for a lot of questions, but it's RL completions time.

		There definitely should be GPU util once learning starts. Are you running this through ./train.py? It should say something like Resources used: 4/8 CPUs, 1/1 GPUs. If not using train.py you'll need to make sure whatever process is running the agent has CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES set correctly.
You can also try running this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/tuned_examples/pong-apex.yaml&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/tuned_examples/pong-apex.yaml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Oh ic, APEX_DDPG never implemented the correct resource request when gpu: True. Also fixed here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/2426/files&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/2426/files&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 interesting, cause your example with pong utilises gpu for normal 10-20%

		This should be fixed in master
