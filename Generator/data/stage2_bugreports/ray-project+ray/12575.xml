	<summary>[tune] register_env checks for FunctionType instead of callable</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/tune/registry.py#L85&gt;registry.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 line 85, check is made for , while in my opinion any  should be accepted, like .
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ubuntu 18
Python 3.8
ray=1.0.1.post1
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

from functools import partial
import ray
from ray.tune.registry import register_env

def launch_env_from_config(config, extra_config=None):
    pass # create env from config and extra_config here
model = None # Here a pytorch model is loaded
ray.init()

foo = partial(launch_env_from_config, extra_config={'model': model})
register_env('MyEnv', foo)
This results in:
TypeError: ('Second argument must be a function.', functools.partial(...))
This is somewhere between a feature request and a bug, but as a user I definitly expected register_env should work as well with functools.partial, as IMO the latter can do all a FuntionType can.
I am not really familiar with the codebase so there might be reasons why check for FunctionType rather than callable is necessary.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
