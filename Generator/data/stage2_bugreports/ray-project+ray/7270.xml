	<summary>[rllib] multiagent example fails on 'explore' error</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

From the current nightly, running ray/rllib/examples/rock_paper_scissors_multiagent.py results in a 'Trials did not complete' error message:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    ray/rllib/utils/exploration/stochastic_sampling.py:79 _get_tf_exploration_action_op
        if explore:
    tensorflow/python/framework/ops.py:690 __bool__
        raise TypeError("Using a tf.Tensor as a Python bool is not allowed. "

    TypeError: Using a tf.Tensor as a Python bool is not allowed. Use if t is not None: instead of if t: to test if a tensor is defined, and use TensorFlow ops such as tf.cond to execute subgraphs conditioned on the value of a tensor.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


ray - nightly &lt;denchmark-link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-0.9.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&gt;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-0.9.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

python - 3.6.9
tensorflow - 1.14.0
OS - Ubuntu 18.04.4

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Oops, looks like we forgot to add this to the tests. cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sven1977&gt;@sven1977&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I don't believe this error is specific to the multiagent example.  You would see the same thing any time that 'explore' is not included in your trainer config or if it is set to None.

		I think this may be specific to TF 1.14 -- I have 2.0 and it seems to work there. We are supporting 1.14, so this should probably be fixed.

 this looks like it could be a bug in the  impl.

		Yes, looks like a tf version issue. ...

		Hmm, it also works fine on py3.6 tf1.14.0 on MacOS. But I do remember seeing this on Travis sometimes (after which I fixed it so tests would pass). Are you sure you are on the latest master branch? I'm adding this example script to our tf1.14 suite, see what'll happen.

		StochasticSampling is not using tf_function anymore exactly because of this error. We are back to using tf.cond everywhere with specific checks on whether explore is a python bool or not.

		Thanks for checking.  I downloaded the latest from &lt;denchmark-link:https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-0.9.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&gt;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-0.9.0.dev0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it works!
I could have sworn that I was using the latest when I filed this, but evidently not.  Thanks again.

		Doesn't happen in Travis Linux either. With tf1.14:
