&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ray.tune'; 'ray' is not a package error once import ray.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "home/rl/project/ray.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    import ray.tune as tune
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ray.tune'; 'ray' is not a package

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
I have ray 0.8.7, pytorch 1.3, and tensorflow 1.13.1, installed on Anaconda python 3.6.8, and the OS is Red Hat 7.8.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

[ X] I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
[ X] I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		It looks like it's trying to import ray.tune from your ray.py file and not the ray library. I think if you rename your file or run import ray in a different directory it should work.
