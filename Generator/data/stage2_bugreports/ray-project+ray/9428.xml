	<summary>[rllib] lr_schedule no longer working in IMPALA?</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I haven't used it in a while, but it seems to me that the lr_schedule no longer get's applied when running IMPALA, the attached script works as expected with PPO, but the reported lr remains constant for IMPALA, unless it's just a reporting issue.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
ray 0.8.6, python 3.6.8, tf 2.2, os rhel 7.6
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Could you provide a simple reproduction script including the used config and everything needed to reproduce this issue?
Thanks.

		I did, it’s attached to the original submission… cart-pole-impala.zip… just needs to be unzipped… the platform rejects .py files… so I zipped it.
