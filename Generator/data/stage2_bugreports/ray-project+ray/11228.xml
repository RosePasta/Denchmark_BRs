		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/manishagarwal23&gt;@manishagarwal23&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
! That's a problem with installing grpcio, not exactly ray; I'm not sure if we have a fix for it yet. grpcio doesn't install on macOS Big Sur either. For now, try cloning ray and commenting out the grpcio dependency in . Then run . Let me know if that works for you!

		But that comes when I do pip install ray . I am not doing any custom steps . How else can I get a valid ray 1.0.0 binaries and dependencies

		Since grpcio hasn't published wheels for CentOS, you'll need to do some custom steps. Unfortunately, I don't think there's anything we can do about this on the Ray end right now. I recommend you follow the workaround I mentioned earlier:
# activate your virtual environment (e.g., source venv/bin/activate, poetry shell, pipenv shell)
git clone https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git --depth 5 --branch ray-1.0.0
cd ray/python/
nano setup.py  # remove grpcio; you might need to remove py-spy also
python3.6 -m pip install .
# at this point, ray should be installed in your venv
alternatively, look into using docker

		without grpcio how will ray communicate with remote machines . will it be able to communicate ? or is there a way to use some other component in place of grpcio

without grpcio how will ray communicate with remote machines

I don't know the details of Ray's gRPC usage but I believe it's used to communicate between raylets and the GCS/plasma store. This will probably break some important communications, but for local development with tune I've found that ray without grpcio works okay.
If you're using CentOS on your cluster, try:

building grpcio from source (see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/python/grpcio#installing-from-source)
using docker or kubernetes so that you can use a better-supported linux container

		</comment>
		<comment id='6' author='manishagarwal23' date='2020-10-06T16:30:04Z'>
		

Can you please share the docker file which I can utilize for communication across machines as without that it would be difficult to move ahead for me.


also if not centos what is that you propose .

		Sure!

Can you please share the docker file which I can utilize for communication across machines
You can start a Ray container with docker run --shm-size=2GB -v host_src_dir:/container_src_dir -t -i ray-project/ray (see https://docs.ray.io/en/master/installation.html?highlight=docker#docker-source-images).

You can also try using the cluster launcher with autoscaling, which has docker support (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/autoscaling.html?highlight=docker#docker-support&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/autoscaling.html?highlight=docker#docker-support&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/cloud.html?highlight=docker#common-cluster-configurations&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/cloud.html?highlight=docker#common-cluster-configurations&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)

also if not centos what is that you propose .

Try using the &lt;denchmark-link:https://hub.docker.com/r/rayproject/ray&gt;rayproject/ray&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 image.

Hmmm okay I think your last option is to build grpcio from source.
Can you follow the steps here? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/python/grpcio#installing-from-source&gt;https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/python/grpcio#installing-from-source&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


can you please share the docker file as well please

completely untested:
FROM rayproject/ray:latest-gpu
COPY src/ /project
WORKDIR /project
RUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
the rayproject/rayimage should contain all the dependencies you need. You can put your project dependencies in src/requirements.txt. I hope this helps!

		I see that in stack above I see lots of GCC . It  means ray installations checjed and tried to compile grpc .is it so ?
		</comment>
		<comment id='12' author='manishagarwal23' date='2020-10-06T17:45:19Z'>
		When you got the error you sent above, this is roughly what happened:

pip checked PyPI to see if there were any wheels for grpcio
there weren't any wheels compatible with centos, so pip downloaded the source archive (grpcio-version.tar.gz)
pip tried to install from source
the installation failed, maybe because of issues with gcc versioning

Is there any other error output (probably a big block of red text)?

		It looks like we might have a typo in the docs—the docker image is at rayproject/ray, not ray-project/ray. I'll push a fix for this soon. Thanks for the catch! Let me know if it works.
