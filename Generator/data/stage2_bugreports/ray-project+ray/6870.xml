	<summary>Tensorboard graphs screwed up with ASHAScheduler</summary>
	<description>
For some reason, I keep getting these types of graphs with tensorboard. I'm using ASHAScheduler:

Any idea what might cause this?

		that's very weird; I've never seen that before. Can you provide a script for repro?

		Give me some time to come up with min working example.
All I know for now is I am setting the timesteps_this_iter manually:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    dr, dh, steps, mean_reward, mean_length = self.do_exploration()
    results['timesteps_this_iter'] = steps
    return results
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		What is the x-axis of your provided chart? Any more systems details/failures?

		<comment id='4' author='drozzy' date='2020-01-20T23:17:46Z'>
		Also, did you set any logging parameters?

		The x-axis I assume is the total timesteps so far, which is made up from the sum of all the  values I returned.

I don't plot it myself - I just let the tune plot it from results dict.
I did not set any logging parameters.

		Hold on, I have an idea of what migh be happening.

		Hm... setting grace_period=10 seems to get rid of this.
Perhaps something to do with restoring a trial - and me not setting the config values correctly?
I'll see if it comes up again and under what conditions.

		I've no idea why this happened... Seems ok now.
If I manage to reproduce will re-open.
