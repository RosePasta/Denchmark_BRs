	<summary>[GCS Actor Management] Possible Error from `test_actor_restart`</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running test_actor_restart locally, it succeeds, but it shows the error that does not appear when GCS Actor management is off.
We should at least figure out why this error occurs.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run test_actor_restart.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
