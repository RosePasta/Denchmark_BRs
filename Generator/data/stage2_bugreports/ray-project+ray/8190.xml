	<summary>Bug: Cannot 'pip install ray' on AWS Ubuntu</summary>
	<description>
I recently started working on an AWS Ubuntu image. I receive the following error when I attempt to pip install ray.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ray==0.8.0; extra == "ray" (from modin[ray]) (from versions: 0.8.4)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for ray==0.8.0; extra == "ray" (from modin[ray])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

OS: 5.4.0-1009-aws

[X ] I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Hmm.. this looks very odd.. can you try uninstall ray and reinstall it?

		I just successfully installed with just "pip install ray" on a brand new Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS EC2 image in US-East-1.

		Apologies, guys. Looks like the instance didn't have cython installed. I assumed it did. That resolved the issue.
