	<summary>Installing Ray in directory with space in the directory name fails.</summary>
	<description>
Here is some of the output from running ./build.sh when ray was cloned in a directory whose name included a space.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;~/dir with space/ray
+ set -e
+++ dirname '/Users/rkn/dir with space/ray/src/numbuf/thirdparty/download_thirdparty.sh'
++ cd '/Users/rkn/dir with space/ray/src/numbuf/thirdparty'
++ pwd

+ '[' '!' -d /Users/rkn/dir with space/ray/src/numbuf/thirdparty/arrow ']'
/Users/rkn/dir with space/ray/src/numbuf/thirdparty/download_thirdparty.sh: line 10: [: too many arguments
