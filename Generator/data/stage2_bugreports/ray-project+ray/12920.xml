	<summary>broken pipe when calling ray.get()</summary>
	<description>
When running under reasonable (not necessarily huge) load I've witnessed broken pipes when calling ray.get() to retrieve something.  Under most conditions this does not happen so I don't have a reproducible script.
we are using ray 1.0.0 on a GKE cluster and minikube (seeing it on both) using python 3.7 on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
The error being reported is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt; File "/app/company/services/ray_services/training/training_details_actor.py", line 316, in get_model_version_dict
    return ray.get(training_details_oid)
  File "/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/worker.py", line 1423, in get
    values = worker.get_objects(object_refs, timeout=timeout)
  File "/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/worker.py", line 303, in get_objects
    object_refs, self.current_task_id, timeout_ms)
  File "python/ray/_raylet.pyx", line 807, in ray._raylet.CoreWorker.get_objects
  File "python/ray/_raylet.pyx", line 150, in ray._raylet.check_status
ray.exceptions.RaySystemError: System error: Broken pipe `
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The code being called is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    def get_model_version_dict(self):
        training_details_oid = self._actor.get_training_details.remote(
            self._model_version_name
        )
        return ray.get(training_details_oid)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

get_training_details is just managing a dictionary of strings
if there are specifics that I'm missing that would be helpful let me know. Thanks!

		Did you see any logs from /tmp/session_latest/logs/raylet.out or core-worker logs when you see this error?

		are those logs found on the specific worker?  also, where/which logs are the core-worker logs?  the pods are still up but the logs seem to have been rotated (haven't found anything with the right dates yet.

		They should be on the head pod. You can just post all the /tmp/ray/session_latest logs (in a zip) if you want us to look through it :)

		unfortunately those logs were long gone.  I updated a number of the libraries (including ray - we were on 1.0.0).  I'm going to close this and open a new one if I run across this again.  thanks!
