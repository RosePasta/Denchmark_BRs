	<summary>[rllib] doc: typo: on_postprocess_batch -&amp;gt; on_postprocess_traj</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

In the documentation it says "on_postprocess_batch" instead of "on_postprocess_traj" in this sentence: "Note that in the on_postprocess_batch callback you have full access to the trajectory batch [...]." (&lt;denchmark-link:https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib-training.html&gt;https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib-training.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
It's just a minor mistake but it seriously threw me off, searching the docs and the code for quite a while for the "on_postprocess_batch" function.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
0.7.6
Does the problem occur on the latest wheels?
does not apply
I'd be happy to make a pull request.
