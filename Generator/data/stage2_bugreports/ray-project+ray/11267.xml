	<summary>[Test] Placement group scheduler test needs to guard the lock-protected attributes.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There's a vector lock that is supposed to lock some vector attributes, but they are not marked with GUARDED_BY as well as not actually protected properly. We should fix this.
EX)



ray/src/ray/gcs/gcs_server/test/gcs_placement_group_scheduler_test.cc


         Line 160
      in

 std::vector&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;GcsServerMocker::MockRayletResourceClient&gt;&gt; raylet_clients_; 





&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Actually, the idea solution is to just make the test single-threaded (by making Redis in memory update happen in the same thread). Is there any good way to achieve this?

		There is no good solution for the moment, because store client has its own io_service, which is not the same thread as the UT main thread.
