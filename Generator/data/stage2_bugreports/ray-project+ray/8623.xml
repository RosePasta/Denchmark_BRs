	<summary>ValueError: ('Observation outside expected value range'</summary>
	<description>
While training some envs in Flow (especially merge and bottleneck) I got the following problem:
File "/Users/fabianafierro/flow/flow/flow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ray/rllib/models/preprocessors.py", line 61, in check_shape
self._obs_space, observation)
ValueError: ('Observation outside expected value range', Box(25,), array([ 2.68858156e-01,  7.31141844e-01,  1.00000000e+00,  5.52634464e-02,

I found the same error in some issues in 2019 and now we are in 2020. How can I solve this?

		This means your env is returning an out of range observation, please check that you defined the lo and high bounds of the obs space correctly.
Maybe raise this issue in the flow repo instead?

		Where do I have to define them? I'm using the default env provided by SUMO with no modifications and it is supposed to work because officially released.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ericl&gt;@ericl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

! I'm having the same error, and I have some questions:

is wrong if the value is equal to the low bound or to the high bound?
the low and the high bounds can be any values that we want? That is, it possible to put -1000, 1000 for every variable although my variables never have that value?
Can you help me, please? :)

		Yeah, you can set the bounds to anything on the observation space. It's
only used for validation.

 I'm having the same error, and I have some questions:

    1. is wrong if the value is equal to the low bound or to the high
    bound?
    2. the low and the high bounds can be any values that we want? That
    is, it possible to put -1000, 1000 for every variable although my variables
    never have that value?
