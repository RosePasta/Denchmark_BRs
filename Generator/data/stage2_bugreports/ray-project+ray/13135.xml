Ray: 1.1.0
Python: 3.7.6
Ubuntu20 in Docker
I'm using ray cluster which has 1 Head with 2 workers in separated nodes. However I had a very strange problem.
When I use ActorPool to distribute the tasks, By chance,  and .
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1471864/103414931-f026b180-4bba-11eb-8187-92b039723034.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And the error log is as follows:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/usr/local/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/util/actor_pool.py", line 91, in map_unordered
   yield self.get_next_unordered()
File "/usr/local/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/util/actor_pool.py", line 201, in get_next_unordered

		Is there any way to reproduce this issue? (Maybe you can provide the docker image)?
Also, can you see which folder causes high disk usage?

  It happened 2 times. The first time I accidentally damaged the scene. The 2nd time I get the info as above.
I'm sorry that I can not provide the docker img. However, you can tell me how to operate when it happened again.

  I think it's caused by coredump.
I have submitted a new question &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/13221&gt;#13221&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
