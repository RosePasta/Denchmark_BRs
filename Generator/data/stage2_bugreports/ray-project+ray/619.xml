	<summary>Jenkins test failure "Failed to decode stderr_data".</summary>
	<description>
The Jenkins tests occasionally fail with the error
raise Exception("Failed to decode stderr_data:", stderr_data)
This is an exception we added in in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/567&gt;#567&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in order to print more information when this error occurred.
From the logs, it looks like it's failing because of the driver ID in the stderr. This should be fixable if we print the driver ID in hex instead, although there may be a better solution.
See these logs for an example. &lt;denchmark-link:https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Ray-PRB/910/console&gt;https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/Ray-PRB/910/console&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This should be fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/632&gt;#632&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but please reopen this if the problem occurs again.
