	<summary>[dashboard] 0.8.6/0.9.0dev - dashboard is not loading machine view</summary>
	<description>
When I start ray with the following command I can't open the dashboard. This happens with 0.8.6 and 0.9.0dev.
Sometimes I can see it, but then when worker node starts, it does not work anymore.
ray start --head --redis-port=8009 --node-manager-port=8010 --object-manager-port=8011 --redis-shard-ports=8012,8013 --autoscaling-config=~/ray_bootstrap_config.yaml 
I just see the side for a short time with "loading" and then it disappears. The same happens in Chromium and Firefox.

		Can you also specify your OS? Also, I couldn't reproduce it from my machine. Would you mind sharing ray_bootstrap_config .yaml?

		I am running on Ubuntu 19.10.
I can reproduce it even without the autoscale.
starting on head:
ray start --head --port=8009 --node-manager-port=8010 --object-manager-port=8011 --redis-shard-ports=8012,8013 --min-worker-port 7000 --max-worker-port 8000
=&gt; dashboard works
starting on worker:
ray start --address='10.64.249.173:8009' --redis-password='5241590000000000'
=&gt; dashboard no longer works
But my worker node is not running properly. I can't execute anything on it, I am still trying to find out why it is not working. So it is probably related. But the dashboard should still work even when the worker is not running correctly.

 could you take a look and try to repro this?

		Seems to be the same issue as: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/9317&gt;#9317&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 is P0, so we will have a fix soon. I will close the issue since it is duplicated.
