	<summary>[Core] Internal config is not set within the gcs_server process</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Currently, the global internal config is set when the raylet inside a head node starts up. This causes an issue that gcs_server itself won't have the correct internal config.
We should fix this by storing this value inside the gcs server.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Issue does not exist anymore!
GCS receives the correct configuration because the user-specified config is available on the head node. The only nodes that need to use GCS to retrieve the SystemConfig are non-head nodes.
