	<summary>[tune] Parameters from `tune.choice()` do not get logged to TensorBoard when integers</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When providing parameters via tune.choice() that include integers, the values are not logged to TensorBoard's HPARAMS section.
The issue is that numpy.random.choice([1, 2, 3]) (for example) returns numpy.int32/numpy.int64 and those types are not included in the VALID_HPARAMS = (str, bool, int, float, list) tuple (python/ray/tune/logger.py).
Since TensorBoard has no issues with logging numpy.int32/64, one simple solution would be to just include those types in the tuple above. Happy to provide a PR if you think this is the way to go.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
ray: 0.8.6
python: 3.7.7
tensorboard: 2.2.2
ubuntu: 20.04
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

from ray import tune

def trainable(config):
    tune.report(score=config["a"])

config_dict = {"a": tune.choice([1, 2, 3])}

tune.run(trainable, config=config_dict, num_samples=1)

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
