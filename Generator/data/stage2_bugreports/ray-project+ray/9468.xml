&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Recently, when I tried to format my code, I cannot find the  directory. This is also mentioned in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/9467&gt;#9467&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I am using the latest master branch on macOS

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
