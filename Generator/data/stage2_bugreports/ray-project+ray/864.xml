	<summary>Mark actors as removed when the corresponding driver process exits.</summary>
	<description>
Currently, when an actor runs the __ray_terminate__ task, it marks itself as removed in Redis. This prevents the unnecessary recreation of that actor if its corresponding local scheduler dies. We need to do the same thing when the corresponding driver dies.
At the very least we should check the driver ID when recreating actors so that we don't recreate actors for drivers that are no longer around.
