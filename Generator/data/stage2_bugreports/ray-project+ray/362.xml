	<summary>Actor test hanging.</summary>
	<description>
Fairly frequently, I'll see
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python test/actor_test.py ActorMethods.testDefineActor
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

hang. An example log from Travis is below. &lt;denchmark-link:https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/210142084/log.txt&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/210142084/log.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		One possibility is the following:

We notify a local scheduler that it is supposed to create an actor with a redis command like PUBLISH actor_notifications &lt;actor_id&gt;&lt;local_scheduler_id&gt;.
The local scheduler subscribes to this channel and passes in a callback that creates the actor in response to a message arriving on the channel.
However, if the publish happens before the subscription is in place, then the actor will never be created and an invocation of one of the actor's methods will never execute.

If this is the problem, then it's part of a recurring problem in which we're using Redis's pubsub functionality as a message bus, but when a client subscribes to a channel, it only receives messages that are sent after the subscription. If it wants to receive previous messages, another mechanism or a layer is needed.
