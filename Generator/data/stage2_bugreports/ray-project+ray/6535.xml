	<summary>[tune] Handle memory and persistent checkpoints separately</summary>
	<description>
MEMORY checkpoints should be treated separately from persistent ones. they should not:

displace persistent checkpoints during garbage collection
prevent restoration (ie if the newest checkpoint is a MEMORY checkpoint but is lost due to failure it should not prevent restoration from the newest persistent checkpoint).
