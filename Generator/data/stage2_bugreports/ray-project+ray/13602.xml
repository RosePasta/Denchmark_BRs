	<summary>Ray cluster: auth_user permissions</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray permissions do not match those of the auth ssh_user specified. Ray Cluster on Ubuntu (v1.1).
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Create a ray cluster from .yaml with:
auth:
    ssh_user: ubuntu

...

head_setup_commands:
    - mkdir abc
Start cluster:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ray up /path/to/your.yaml
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Result:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mkdir: cannot create directory ‘abc’: Permission denied
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, logging in as user ubuntu: mkdir abc works fine.
As I understand this is because ray works in a container with working directory /.
So, ideally we'd want to copy /home/ubuntu into the container - how do we do that?

		The answer to this is that ray runs inside a docker container as a new user, ray. Starting with a cd /home/ray you can modify directories as expected under that tree.
My personal reason for needing to modify dirs was giving ray ssh credentials spread between various files. What I ended up doing was getting them in the container by using a file mount:
file_mounts: {
    "/home/ray/.ssh": "/my/folder/with/ssh/creds"
}
Then using these credentials to curl / clone things etc, just make sure you have run cd /home/ray first.
