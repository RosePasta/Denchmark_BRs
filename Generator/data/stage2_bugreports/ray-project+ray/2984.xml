		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rghelichi&gt;@rghelichi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/2974&gt;#2974&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should fix this, can you try it out?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ericl&gt;@ericl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I saw the commits but I can't find the branch/pull request that solved it.
I think apart from those commits:
in es.py
line 29: "DEFAULT_CONFIG = {" , should be read with "with_common_config("
and
in ars.py
there is a check for the shape of the input which should be removed.

 it's these changes that pass in "model_options" that fixes the problem, for example: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/2974/files#diff-470490be1162955b1e0365174cc5ca17R183&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/2974/files#diff-470490be1162955b1e0365174cc5ca17R183&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Basically, the problem was that get_model() had the model options (which contains the custom model config) as an optional parameter. So for ARS and ES, we forgot to pass them through correctly and so it would always use the default model.
re: check on the shape, could you comment in the PR where that is?

  thank you for the message.
For the changes I assume I will wait till the merge gets approved then I try the master.
for shape check, I am referring to ARS:
ars/policies.py
65        if len(preprocessor.shape) &gt; 1:
raise UnsupportedSpaceException(
"Observation space {} is not supported with ARS.".format(
preprocessor.shape))

		Thanks! I don't remember why that check was there...

		This should be fixed in master.

		Thank you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ericl&gt;@ericl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I assume it is version 0.5.3 right?

		They're in the master builds (you can find the latest wheels here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html&gt;https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) -- though I think you need to replace "0.5.2" with "0.5.3" in the URLs.
