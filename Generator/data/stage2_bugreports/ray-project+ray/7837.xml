	<summary>GCS Resolves to Wrong Address</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

GCS Resolves Hostname to incorrect address on MacOS. This causes a variety of problems with actors and ray functionality.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ray: 0.84
OS: MacOS Catalina
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
ray.init()
@ray.remote
class Actor:
    def G(self):
        return 30
act = Actor.remote()
ray.get(act.G.remote())
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		No, it's more of a MacOS configuration problem.

		Solution:
Get the current LocalHostName by running:
sudo scutil --get LocalHostName
Set the HostName to the result above with .local appended to it.
sudo scutil --set HostName &lt;name_from_above&gt;.local

		Just let you know I could use Ray on Mac without the setup you commented (I also don't have .local appended to my host name).

  and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/simon-mo&gt;@simon-mo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . What IP Address does it resolve to?
It should be in , on this line:

		BTW, the fix that still consistently works for me is RAY_GCS_SERVICE_ENABLED=0. Right now without it on the latest master, I get the following on my mac:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;print(ray.cluster_resources())
# {}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 is it ok to reopen this issue? I think it's better to have a Ray that works out of the box (then for the user to need to run sudo commands).

 I'm reopening this. PR (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/7842&gt;#7842&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) should fix this (within ray).
