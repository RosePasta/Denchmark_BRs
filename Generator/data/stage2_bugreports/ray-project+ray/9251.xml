	<summary>Aysyncio ObjectID becomes None</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Calling await on a task's ObjectID inside an async Actor sometimes results in the following error AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'call_soon_threadsafe'. This happens when the task runs after the actor method returns. This does not happen if asyncio.wait() is called. Sometimes this issue results in a weird segfault.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):

Change this line to await worker.handle_request.remote(req)
Run pytest -vs serve/tests/test_api.py::test_shadow_traffic

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
