	<summary>num_local_objects grows without bound on 0.8.4 (seems worse than 0.8.2)</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running the ARS script in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/7976&gt;#7976&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 shows that the local object count increases to the millions. This could be one reason for the slowdown. In earlier versions, I also see the count grow, but not as much (80k vs 1.8m).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-30-2-171:~$ ray stat | grep num_local

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

You can reproduce this locally by running [f.remote() for _ in range(1000)] where f is a trivial remote function and then using ray stat | grep num_local.

 this looks like a possible leak in the local memory store / distributed ref counting? What would be a good way to confirm, are there some flags I can flip off?
Note that it takes a few hours for the slowdown to occur so it's somewhat hard to reproduce, though I can provide a running VM for debugging if helpful.

		Unfortunately I don't think there's a way to turn off ref counting completely without recompiling, but you might be able to flip this flag to False: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/_raylet.pyx#L657&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/_raylet.pyx#L657&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
