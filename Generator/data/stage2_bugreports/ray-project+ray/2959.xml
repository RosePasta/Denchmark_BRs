	<summary>[xray] `ObjectDirectory` fires callbacks in the same function</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Describe the problem&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Many of the  methods (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/src/ray/object_manager/object_directory.cc#L158&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) take in a callback as an argument. This is natural since the operation to the GCS is asynchronous. However, the callback often gets called , which makes it easy to do bad things like invalidate an iterator in the caller. This happens even when the operation is synchronous (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/src/ray/object_manager/object_directory.cc#L115&gt;example&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
).
We should modify this to make sure that callbacks are always fired as a separate handler. We should also make sure that callbacks are only passed in where necessary.
