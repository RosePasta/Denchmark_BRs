	<summary>TwoStepGame.py doesn't work for contrib/MADDPG [rllib]</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Running &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/twostep_game.py&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/examples/twostep_game.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the option contrib/MADDPG for --run gives this error:

Is MADDPG not supposed to work for discrete observation spaces?  I've also tried it on my own environment from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6884&gt;#6884&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (which uses a Tuple observation space) and it complains that the state space isn't valid.

		Hey, I'm the maintainer of the MADDPG example code and I've used the implementation a fair bit. My first guess would be trying installing tensorflow-probability==0.7.0 and seeing if that fixes your error.

		If that doesn't work, please do pip freeze and post the results

 Hello! Does MADDPG support MultiDiscrete action now?

		No. The MADDPG implementation here is kinda cursed.

 I just modified the code and it should support MultiDiscrete Action now.
To be simple, the code I added in  is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sampler= tf.concat([tfp.distributions.RelaxedOneHotCategorical(
                            temperature=1.0, logits=feature).sample() for feature in
                                    tf.split(feature, self.nvec, axis=1)], axis=1)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Now, the sum of actor network output will be N  if agent has N MultiDiscrete Action space
The whole code can be found &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/King-Of-Knights/ray/blob/master/rllib/contrib/maddpg/maddpg_policy.py&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
