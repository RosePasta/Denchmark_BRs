	<summary>Segfault when putting object whose class closes over an ObjectID.</summary>
	<description>
The following causes a segfault.
import ray

class Foo():
    def __init__(self):
        self.val = ray.put(0)
    def method(self):
        f

ray.init()

f = Foo()

ray.put(f)
The error appears to happen when trying to pickle the class Foo. We prevent object IDs from being pickled at



ray/src/common/lib/python/common_extension.cc


        Lines 205 to 208
      in
      b1d8902






 static PyObject *PyObjectID___reduce__(PyObjectID *self) { 



 PyErr_SetString(CommonError, "ObjectID objects cannot be serialized."); 



 return NULL; 



 } 





However, we never registered  with the python extension module. I think that's the problem. Should be fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/1316&gt;#1316&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
