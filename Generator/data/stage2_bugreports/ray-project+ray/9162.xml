	<summary>test_task_runner_perform_batch() sporadic failure</summary>
	<description>
This error has occurred occasionally on CI, I don't think it's been fixed:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;=================================== FAILURES ===================================

        ...
        my_batch_sizes = await asyncio.gather(
            *[q.enqueue_request.remote(query_param) for _ in range(3)])
&gt;       assert my_batch_sizes == [2, 2, 1]

E         Full diff:

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It's quite sporadic; I don't have a repro currently, but here are some occurrences:

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
