	<summary>[Metric] Override error</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import ray
from ray.util import metrics
import time

ray.init()

a = metrics.Count("num_count", description="")
b = metrics.Count("num_count", description="")

a.record(1)
b.record(1)

time.sleep(10)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

shows
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Attempt to register measure with already-registered name: name: "num_count"; units: ""; description: ""; type: double
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
