	<summary>[tune] GPU utilization getting checked for cluster with no gpu</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Trivial issue, which does not actually impact performance as far as I can tell, but it seems if you launch a cluster with a configuration that sets gpus = 0, then there might be a check which avoids this error message...

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
