	<summary>[Object Spilling] IO Workers don't seem to be fully utilized.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

While developing &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/11379&gt;#11379&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I found out the performance was really slow sometimes, and found out only 2 IO workers were utilized although I specified 10 IO workers.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 I will solve this issue before working on combining small objects into a big object.
