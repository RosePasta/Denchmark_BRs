	<summary>[Dashboard] Dashboard not available when cluster is being ready.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When this repo &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/danwallach/arlo-e2e-noop/tree/main/src/arlo_e2e_noop&gt;https://github.com/danwallach/arlo-e2e-noop/tree/main/src/arlo_e2e_noop&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 starts and port-forward the ray dashboard, it has a json error on the screen until the cluster is ready. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/danwallach&gt;@danwallach&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can explain this better.
This shouldn't be the case. Regardless of what the cluster is doing, as long as the head node is alive, dashboard shouldn't render any error. We might want to add some regression tests to prevent this (with cluster_utils). This might be resolved when the new dashboard is on though.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run the script in the repo. It doesn't require any additional setup :)

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
