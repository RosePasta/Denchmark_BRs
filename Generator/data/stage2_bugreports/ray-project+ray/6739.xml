	<summary>Fail to compile Ray dashboard client</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When I compile the nodejs for the dashboard, i get the following message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Definition for rule '@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-assertions' was not found
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It turns out that we need to update react-scripts to 3.1.2 as mention &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/7711&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
master
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone https://github.com/ray-project/ray.git

# Install Bazel.
ray/ci/travis/install-bazel.sh

# Optionally build the dashboard (requires Node.js, see below for more information).
pushd ray/python/ray/dashboard/client
npm ci
npm run build
popd
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.

		Thanks for the report! I can't reproduce the error on my machine, but more than happy to upgrade  to 3.1.2 if that makes it work on your machine. Feel free to try out &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/6769&gt;#6769&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or submit a PR that fixes the issue for you :)
