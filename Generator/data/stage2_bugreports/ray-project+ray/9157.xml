	<summary>[dashboard] 0.8.6 two nodes with same name cause flickering</summary>
	<description>
I have two Ubuntu 19.10 with the exact same config (0.8.6) and name. Just the IP is different (I cloned a VM).
Then in the dashboard it shows only one of both. It switches between both (IP is changing).
Start head:
ray start --head --port=6379
worker:
ray start --address='192.168.40.129:6379' --redis-password='5241590000000000'
As soon as I changed the name of the second vm, it works as expected.

 maybe we should append the IP to the node name?

 I still cannot assign &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mfitton&gt;@mfitton&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to issues. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robertnishihara&gt;@robertnishihara&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Do you know how we can enable this?

 that's an option. We could also perform the grouping by IP in the first place but display by hostname, since I think that is more unique than hostname.

		FYI, this issue is fixed in the new dashboard backend, which will be released with 1.0.2 and is currently in the nightly.
