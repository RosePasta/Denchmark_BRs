	<summary>[tune] HParams failed - unsupported type NoneType</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Scikit-learn sometimes takes None as a parameter. This does not seem to agree with TensorBoard's HParams, as an error pops up when None is sampled from my parameter space.
Not sure how this should be handled â€“ detect and replace it with str(None)? ðŸ˜€
(running on ray 0.8.0, performing hyperparameter search with HyperOpt)
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

No script as it's kind of straightforward: define a hyperparameter space with the value None in it.

		Hm, can you try running the latest version of Ray? This should be fixed.
