	<summary>[GCS Actor Management] Dashboard still renders ALIVE state when actors are DEAD</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

It happens only when gcs actor management is on.

When actors are killed, the dashboard doesn't update the actor state to DEAD.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
This is just for tracking. I will work on this issue.
