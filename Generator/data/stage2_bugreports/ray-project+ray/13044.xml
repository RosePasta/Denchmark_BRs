	<summary>[autoscaler][docker] num files ulimit extremely low</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When starting a new ray cluster, the ulimit inside the docker container is very low. This is a problem because our recommended ulimit -n 65535; ray start --head ... approach runs into a permission denied within docker.
The proper solution is to do . The implementation here should mirror  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/11953&gt;#11953&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
