	<summary>[tune] HyperBand example raising AssertionError</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I tried running &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/tune/examples/hyperband_example.py&gt;hyperband_example.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it's giving me s. More specifically, it's raising because  didn't meet.
I tried to see what delta is at the superficial level and it was just making sure that the difference in training_iterations between two trials was not negative. I don't know exactly what is happening. Somebody please help :(
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.4

$ uname -a
Linux 8ff4b6dbe5ce 5.3.0-40-generic #32~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 3 14:05:59 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

&gt;&gt;&gt; ray.__version__
'0.8.2'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
Run the above hyperband example.
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
