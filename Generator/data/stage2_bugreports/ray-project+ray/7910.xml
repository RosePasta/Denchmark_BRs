	<summary>[rllib] IMPALA: FloatingPointError: invalid value encountered in double_scalars</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

IMPALA metrics makes assumption about  items not being empty in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/rllib/utils/window_stat.py&gt;WindowStat&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 class. If it is in fact empty, we get an exception rather that

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I don't have a reproduction for this because the environment that triggers it is custom. Its pretty obvious what is going on though. It just needs the same treatment as the other metrics bugs of this class had here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/797e6cfc2afa7d7f503ad847b31c36a010c4513c&gt;797e6cf&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
