	<summary>[autoscaler] Ray autoscaler: Monitor could not find IP</summary>
	<description>
I have done my own research about this and tried to find relevant issues on my current problem, but I did not find any suitable reference. I tried to up my own local cluster based on this reference &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/autoscaler/local/example-full.yaml&gt;local autoscaller&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/autoscaler/local/example-full.yaml&gt;the YAML file&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It succeeds to build the ray context in the head node, but nothing happens in the worker node.
When I checked in the logs monitor, the message error is like this:
==&gt; /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.out &lt;==

==&gt; /tmp/ray/session_2020-11-23_09-56-20_904295_22151/logs/monitor.err &lt;==

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):

python 3.6.6
ray 1.0.1.post1

This is how I run the script and the YAML file is based on the Ray git reference (link above) and I just changed the head and worker IP.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

ray up cluster-local.yaml

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
