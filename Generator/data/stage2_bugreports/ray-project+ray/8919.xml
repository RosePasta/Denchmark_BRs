	<summary>[rllib] rllib train ... --checkpoint-at-end flag is ignored</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray 0.8.5
Python 3.7
MacOS Catalina
PyTorch 1.4.0
No checkpoint is produced when the --checkpoint-at-end flag is used. Adding --checkpoint-freq 10 does cause checkpoints to be saved.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

rllib train --run PPO --env CartPole-v0 --stop='{"training_iteration": 25}' --ray-address auto --checkpoint-at-end
No checkpoint directory exists under ~/ray_results/default/PPO...
Add the --checkpoint-freq 10 flag:
rllib train --run PPO --env CartPole-v0 --stop='{"training_iteration": 25}' --ray-address auto --checkpoint-at-end --checkpoint-freq 10
Now there are checkpoint_10 and checkpoint_20 directories, but not a checkpoint_25 at the end.
Could the choice of stop criteria, training_iteration, have something to do with it?

Note: Being persnickety, it bugs me that the final directory path for the checkpoints is .../checkpoint_20/checkpoint-20 (underscore vs. dash). How about one or the other?


 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
