	<summary>Ray can't be restarted after several hours of use</summary>
	<description>
Hallo,
So I'm using ray 0.8.2 with python 3.6 on a Kubuntu 18.04LTS and my problem is the following:
I reinitialize for several tests ray with init() and at the end shuting it down with shutdown() and this works great for several hours of many tests. But after some time I've got the following messages, strangly in two trials the message were different:
First try:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-04-17 23:22:13,630	INFO resource_spec.py:212 -- Starting Ray with 82.62 GiB memory available for workers and up to 18.63 GiB for objects. You can adjust these settings with ray.init(memory=&lt;bytes&gt;, object_store_memory=&lt;bytes&gt;).
2020-04-17 23:22:14,148	WARNING services.py:850 -- Redis failed to start, retrying now.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Second try:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-04-18 04:03:18,889	INFO resource_spec.py:212 -- Starting Ray with 73.34 GiB memory available for workers and up to 18.63 GiB for objects. You can adjust these settings with ray.init(memory=&lt;bytes&gt;, object_store_memory=&lt;bytes&gt;).

Do you have any idea, what could be here the problem?
In the meantime I've updated to ray 0.8.4 and it is running at the moment...
I've further introduced a sleep of 10 seconds after shutdown(), hoping this would help somehow.
I don't think it is a memory issue, because the memory-usage stays constant.

		Update:
So my third try is still running, but what I've already observed is by chance, that it had already the same problem like in the first try with Redis, but this time it manached somehow to reconnect. So I've got the following warning, but afterwards it run further without problems (till now, the sript is still running...):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;2020-04-18 17:06:10,629	INFO resource_spec.py:212 -- Starting Ray with 61.13 GiB memory available for workers and up to 30.19 GiB for objects. You can adjust these settings with ray.init(memory=&lt;bytes&gt;, object_store_memory=&lt;bytes&gt;).
2020-04-18 17:06:10,772	WARNING services.py:916 -- Redis failed to start, retrying now.
2020-04-18 17:06:11,230	INFO services.py:1148 -- View the Ray dashboard at localhost:8266
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So it seems to have from time to time problems, connecting to Redis. Should I increase somewhere the timeout or the number of reconnection-attempts and how would I do this?

		Update 2:
Ok, now it worked! Don't know, if it was the Ray-Update, the introduced sleep(10) after shutdown() or just by chance! Will investigate it further and give you an update, if I have new information...

 thanks for the update. Let us know :)

		I also noticed a few times that Ray (using it with RLlib) just stopped working after a few hours with exactly one CPU core on 100% load. The process could then neither stopped with SIGINT nor with SIGQUIT. I was running in a tmux session and I could kill the session, but the memory would still be allocated and there were a few Ray processes left running. I restarted the machine and didn't investigate any further. Not sure if this is really related to this issue, but I will try to find out more if this happens again for me.

		Update2:
Ok, I've let it run a second time with the measures discribed above and it worked again. So it was much likely not by chance, that it worked. And then I've let it run a third time without the sleep(10) and it worked too. So I think the problem was fixed in ray 0.8.4! Thanks a lot!
A last question, would it be possible for me to set the timeout and the times of reconnection-tries to Redis, so that I could increase them?
Just for further information, I'm working on a machine with the following specs and per run of ray are 128 workers running:

SSD: Samsung PM1725a MZPLL3T2HMLS - Solid-State-Disk - 3.2 TB - intern - HHHL (HHHL) - PCI Express 3.0 x8 (NVMe)
CPU: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2990WX (TR4, 3GHz, Unlocked)
Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX X399-E GAMING (TR4, AMD X399, E-ATX)
Graphics: Gainward RTX2080 Ti Phoenix GS, 11GB GDDR6
RAM: G.Skill Flare X DDR4-2933MHz CL16-16-16-36 1.35V 128GB (8x16GB)
LAN-Card: Edimax EN-9320SFP+ (Chipsatz TN4010 MAC from Tehuti Networks), SFP+ Netzwerkkarte

 can you open a new issue for that?
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Kuurusch&gt;@Kuurusch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 re: timeout, can you file a question/feature request?
Just wanted to close this issue because the original issue is resolved (and single-issue threads is much easier on the project maintainers)
