	<summary>[Logging] Warning printed twice on --plasma-directory</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ ray start --head --plasma-directory=/tmp
2020-08-21 13:40:02,011	INFO scripts.py:554 -- Using IP address 192.168.1.193 for this node.
2020-08-21 13:40:02,014	INFO resource_spec.py:250 -- Starting Ray with 4.49 GiB memory available for workers and up to 2.27 GiB for objects. You can adjust these settings with ray.init(memory=&lt;bytes&gt;, object_store_memory=&lt;bytes&gt;).
2020-08-21 13:40:02,424	INFO services.py:1209 -- View the Ray dashboard at localhost:8265
2020-08-21 13:40:02,426	WARNING services.py:1606 -- WARNING: object_store_memory is not verified when plasma_directory is set.
2020-08-21 13:40:02,431	WARNING services.py:1606 -- WARNING: object_store_memory is not verified when plasma_directory is set.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 I believe it was fixed. Please reopen if I am wrong.
