	<summary>[core] Driver log file lost after multiple `ray.init`s in the same process</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS): 0.9dev
The driver logs to a python-core-driver-* file correctly during the first ray.init(), but then a subsequent ray.shutdown() and ray.init() does not produce a second file in the session logs. This is probably only relevant for pytests that run multiple ray sessions in the same process.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Any checked in pytest. For example, pytest python/ray/tests/test_basic.py.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
