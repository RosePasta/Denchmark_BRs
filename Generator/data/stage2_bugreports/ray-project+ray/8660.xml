	<summary>[autoscaler] Local Cluster with Docker: Check failed: !local_node_id_.IsNil() This node is disconnected.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is your question?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've been trying to run a cluster using two hosts with docker. But after running ray up -y cluster.yml, I get the following situation after some minutes:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18473249/83157458-feb76280-a0d9-11ea-842b-2d34d1ace91a.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Workers keeps incresing by 16 (number of cores) on the worker node, and the same error popping up on the logs.
View all logs:

 This could possibly be heartbeat lag. I saw several cases when CPU load is high, heartbeats start to lag and are not reached on time, and it marks nodes as dead. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/icaropires&gt;@icaropires&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you loosen the resource limit of your containers? That says, can you loosen the memory and cpu constraint on Docker containers a lot and see if the same error happens?

Thanks for the response &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rkooo567&gt;@rkooo567&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . But I don't think that's the problem, because I wasn't running any script (I've just ran ) and I haven't set any constraints. But, anyway, I've tried to run with:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;run_options: ["--shm-size 25GB --cpus=16 --memory=50g"]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

and got the same behavior. It seems to me that the heartbeats are never reaching the head node

 Thanks for the quick response. We will surely investigate it. Btw, is it urgent for you? Can you use some different solutions until we figure out the root cause (like running without Docker)?

		No problem! Please share your solution if you figured this out. We tried to fix this problem as it happens to many users, but we failed to reproduce it several times ourselves!

 The problem is the indicated at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/8648&gt;#8648&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ! The  is being set to localhost in head node, inside or outside the container. I've had success with the following steps:

ray start the head node
connect to redis using redis-cli and set  GcsServerAddress to &lt;my_ip:&lt;same port as before&gt;
ray start other nodes

(I've tested inside containers, but it should work outside as well)
ray version: 0.8.6
I don't know the reason this is happening, in other environments it gets the correct IP

		Really appreciate it! Would you mind trying one more thing actually? Could you run this command in the head node and see what's the IP addresses in this case?
import ray
ray.init(address='auto')
print(ray.services.get_node_ip_address())
The GCS server IP address is resolved in CPP, and it seems like it sometimes doesn't resolve the correct local IP addresses (It first pings Google DNS server, and if it fails, it uses asio resolver to get local IP addresses. If both fails, the address is set to be the localhost (your case)). I'd like to check if Python's IP resolution also fails when you run it inside Docker containers.

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Some more informations&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


it first pings Google DNS server



ping 8.8.8.8 works from my head node 🤔


This "GcsServerAddress as localhost" behaviour is happening outside the Docker containers too!


In ray version 0.8.6, when opening the dashboard the behaviour is that described in #8805


In ray version 0.8.5, when not using autoscaler, no problems can be seen in dashboard, but only the head node resources are used


I'll be happy to provide any more details if needed 😃

 I think the issue is that  timeout is too short in CPP code. I can probably push the PR and see if it fixes the issue. If you have any other thought, please let me know!

 I've tried to increase timeout to like 2s but I've got the same behaviour even  my ping response being less than 100ms to 8.8.8.8.
So I invested in trying to fix the fallback option, the local resolve, and implemented the solution at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/10004&gt;#10004&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
But I guess that even being able to suggest the right IP most of the times, there might be situations in which the best is let the user specify GcsServerAddress (if there are more than one valid IP, for example), probably by passing a flag on CLI.
