	<summary>Broken upstream link</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The old pickle5 revision breaks after we update the pickle5 upstream:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone https://github.com/suquark/pickle5-backport
pushd pickle5-backport
  git checkout 8ffe41ceba9d5e2ce8a98190f6b3d2f3325e5a72
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This affects v0.7.7 ~ v0.8.5
Related issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/8567&gt;#8567&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		I have recovered the revision by git reflog, and points it to outdated branch. Now it works again.
