	<summary>Visionnet variable referenced before assignment</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I'm trying to run MAPPO algorithm using PettingZoo's &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.pettingzoo.ml/magent/tiger_deer&gt;Tiger-Deer environment&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and I obtained the error, below.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "/home/python3.7/site-packages/ray/rllib/models/tf/visionnet.py", line 65, in __init__
    name="conv{}".format(i + 1))(last_layer)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'i' referenced before assignment at time: 1.60107e+09
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Taking a look at the file visionnet.py, it does appear like the variable should have been set in the for-loop #L29. The only way for it not to have been set is if enumerate(filters[:-1], 1) returned empty. The offending line is below.



ray/rllib/models/tf/visionnet.py


         Line 67
      in
      8f79b4e






 name="conv{}".format(i + 1))(last_layer) 





For reference, the obs shape for Tiger-Deer env is [9, 9, 146]. In the model configuration for running the Tune experiment, I set conv_filters = [[128, [9, 9], 1]]. If the issue is my conv_filters, could you please point me in the right direction?
I'm running ray==0.8.7 and PettingZoo==1.3.3 on Ubuntu 18.04.5 Bionic.

 Yes, this seems like a bug. I guess we weren't thinking about these non-image yet image-like obs spaces when we wrote this loop (thinking that one would always use more than 1 conv layer). In your case, this is perfectly valid, though. Then again, more than 1 layers may still help here.
We'll provide a fix. ...
