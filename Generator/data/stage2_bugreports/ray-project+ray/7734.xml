	<summary>Memory monitor get_py_stack breaks Control+C</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Memory monitor added get_py_stack function. In some workload, control+C will be sent to that function and not be able to stop ray in terminal. You keep hitting control+C until somehow the main thread is no longer occupied by get_py_stack function.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
try run microbenchmark and control+C it during the test
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; ray microbenchmark
Tip: set TESTS_TO_RUN='pattern' to run a subset of benchmarks

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

^ Don't try the latest, latest wheel though, see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/7732&gt;#7732&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, need to revert &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/commit/6141fdab955926229f3c20581771ac3a1c0819c5&gt;6141fda&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
