	<summary>Clarify atexit docs</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

From discourse: &lt;denchmark-link:https://discuss.ray.io/t/ray-inconsistent-documentation-atexit-behavior-with-ray-kill-actor/188&gt;https://discuss.ray.io/t/ray-inconsistent-documentation-atexit-behavior-with-ray-kill-actor/188&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the source code documentation for ray.kill(actor) it states:
This will interrupt any running tasks on the actor, causing them to fail
immediately. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will still be run.
Source: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/worker.py#L1536&gt;https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/worker.py#L1536&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the documentation online it states:
This will not go through the normal Python sys.exit teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using atexit will not be called.

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a short code snippet (less than 50 lines if possible) that can be copy-pasted to reproduce the issue. The snippet should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If the code snippet cannot be run by itself, the issue will be closed with "needs-repro-script".

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
