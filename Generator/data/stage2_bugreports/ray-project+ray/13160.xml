	<summary>[Ray] Raylet crashes due to overloaded, is that possible for it to auto-restart on crashes?</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ray version: 1.1.0
We are using Ray for running multiple tasks at different times. When a raylet crashes due to overloaded, is it possible to make it auto-restart so the next tasks don't result in error?

 Isn't it already supposed to be auto-started?

		The AutoScaler already restarts it. This issue isn't well specified so I'm going to close it.
