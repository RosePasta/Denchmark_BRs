	<summary>[docs] "Testing for C++ development" documentation is broken</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I've tried to use command from Testing for C++ development documentation page: bazel test $(bazel query 'kind(cc_test, ...)') and it doesn't work
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ubuntu 18.04, ray 0.8.4 release tag
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ TEST_TMPDIR=/rpovelik/bazel-cache bazel test $(bazel query 'kind(cc_test, ...)')
$TEST_TMPDIR defined: output root default is '/rpovelik/bazel-cache/' and max_idle_secs default is '15'.
Starting local Bazel server and connecting to it...

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 can you take a look? looks like the real issue is
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: error loading package 'deploy/ray-operator': Unable to find package for @bazel_gazelle//:def.bzl: The repository '@bazel_gazelle' could not be resolved.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 Operator is a separate workspace. By using  you're including more than one workspace. I would suggest  since that only includes targets in the current workspace. I don't know why Operator is failing unfortunately; it's not something I work on. But I believe this is a known issue (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/7257&gt;#7257&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/6218&gt;#6218&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
), so I'll close this one.

 would you know why the build fails for Operator? Is it something that can be fixed easily?
