&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I'm using

ray==0.8.2
Python 3.7.2
MacOS

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Bug 1&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

This is likely somewhat timing dependent, but when I run the following script
import ray
ray.init()
@ray.remote
class GrandChild:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
@ray.remote
class Child:
    def __init__(self):
        grand_child_handle = GrandChild.remote()
@ray.remote
class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        children_handles = [Child.remote() for _ in range(2)]
parent_handle = Parent.remote()
the dashboard.py process crashes with the following error.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/rkn/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/threading.py", line 926, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/Users/rkn/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/dashboard/dashboard.py", line 546, in run
    current_actor_table = ray.actors()
  File "/Users/rkn/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/state.py", line 1133, in actors
    return state.actor_table(actor_id=actor_id)
  File "/Users/rkn/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/state.py", line 369, in actor_table
    ray.ActorID(actor_id_binary))
  File "/Users/rkn/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/state.py", line 321, in _actor_table
    assert len(gcs_entries.entries) == 1
AssertionError
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Bug 2&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

As a consequence, the dashboard doesn't display anything.
There is a second bug here, which is that the error message wasn't pushed to the driver or displayed in the UI in any way.
We have a test testing that tests that an error message is pushed to the driver when the monitor process dies. 


ray/python/ray/tests/test_failure.py


         Line 544
      in
      007333b






 def test_warning_monitor_died(ray_start_2_cpus): 





I thought we had a similar test for the dashboard, but I don't see it anywhere. Note that we appear to have the plumbing in place to push error messages to the driver when the dashboard process dies, but I didn't see the relevant error message. See 


ray/python/ray/dashboard/dashboard.py


        Lines 928 to 929
      in

 ray.utils.push_error_to_driver_through_redis( 



 redis_client, ray_constants.DASHBOARD_DIED_ERROR, message)
