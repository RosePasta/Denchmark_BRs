	<summary>[autoscaler] read_namespaced_pod vs. read_namespaced_pod_status</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

There’s a bunch of places where ray is doing core_api().read_namespaced_pod_status() but I don’t have the permission to read pods/status. It needs to be explicitly granted, so having permission to get pods does not give you permission to get pods/status.  Can I suggest that you use read_namespaced_pod instead? It returns the same information but it seems like it is more common to have that permission than the more specialized pods/status.
Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
Ray 0.8.7
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

n/a (the default ray cluster config will replicate)

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
