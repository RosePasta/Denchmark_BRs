	<summary>Test failure in stress_tests.py, couldn't start Redis.</summary>
	<description>
I've seen the following test failure fairly frequently. The error happens in the test
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python test/stress_tests.py
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the error will look like the following.
======================================================================
ERROR: testNondeterministicTask (__main__.ReconstructionTestsMultinode)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):

Note that this happens in a variety of tests within stress_tests.py.

, and the output for the relevant test was the following:
