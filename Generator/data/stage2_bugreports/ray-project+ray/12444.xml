	<summary>[autoscaler] initial_workers does not work</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


ray nightly

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Start a k8s autoscaling cluster with a config.yaml that has initial_workers: 1
Result: No initial workers are started


 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PidgeyBE&gt;@PidgeyBE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , we no longer support  with the new autoscaler. What is your use case? why do you need it?

We don't necessarily need it. I just wasn't aware that it was deprecated and saw it wasn't working anymore...
Can be closed for me!

 can we make this deprecation more clear to users? e.g., throwing an error if initial_workers is included in the YAML?
