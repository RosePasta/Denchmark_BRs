	<summary>Access trial name within trainable class</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I  want to get trial name within trainable class, i have tried two methods:
1.class ESMMTrainable(tune.Trainable):
def setup(self, config):
import tensorflow as tf
self.trial_name = config['trial_name']
but get error: KeyError: 'trial_name

class ModifiedAsyncHyperBandScheduler(AsyncHyperBandScheduler):
def on_trial_add(self, trial):
trial.config["trial_name"] = str(trial)
super().on_trial_add(trial)
i get another error:
TypeError: on_trial_add() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given

Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.
