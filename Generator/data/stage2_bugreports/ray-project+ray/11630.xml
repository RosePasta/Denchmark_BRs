	<summary>[Dashboard] New dashboard crashes when looking at worker logs.</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Not sure if it is reproducible in a single node. But when I ran multi-nodes clusters (59 nodes), the attempt to see worker logs from the UI crashed the frontend.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.

 I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
 I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

		This doesn't seem reproducible. I checked to see whether I could reproduce in the  stress test which runs a large cluster. I think this might have been related to what this PR fixed: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/12660&gt;#12660&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Please let me know if you see it again or can reproduce.
