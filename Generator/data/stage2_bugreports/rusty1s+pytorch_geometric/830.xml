&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;‚ùì Questions &amp; Help&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi! What kinds of networkx graphs are expected to work with from_networkx. Right now, the documentation just says that it expects a networkx graph, but there are definitely some networkx graphs for which it doesn't work:
Graphs without contiguous node labels:
The following cell runs without error. Except the output is a little funky-
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from torch_geometric.utils.convert import from_networkx
import networkx as nx 

# build an nx graph 
graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_node(4)
graph.add_node(2)
graph.add_node(6)
graph.add_edge(4, 6)
graph.add_edge(2, 6)
for node in graph.nodes():
    graph.nodes[node]["x"] = node

# convert to pyg
data = from_networkx(graph)   
print(f"X: {data.x}")
print(f"Edge index: {data.edge_index}")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The output is:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;X: tensor([4, 2, 6])
Edge index: tensor([[4, 2, 6, 6],
        [6, 6, 4, 2]])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The node indices in the edge_index have no correspondence with the order of the nodes in the feature matrix x. It seems to me like from_networkx is dependent on: (1) node labels of nx.Graph being consecutive numbers (i.e. from 0 to len(graph) - 1) and (2) that graph.nodes() returns these nodes in order. That being said, perhaps I am missing something with how Data is being used in message passing etc. In either case, I think it would be helpful to add a note in the documentation about the kinds of networkx graphs the function will work with.
Graphs without edges:
The following crashes with a IndexError: list index out of range
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from torch_geometric.utils.convert import from_networkx
import networkx as nx 

graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_node(1)
graph.add_node(2)
from_networkx(graph)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Graphs with non-numeric node labels
Crashes with ValueError: too many dimensions 'str'
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from torch_geometric.utils.convert import from_networkx
import networkx as nx 

# build an nx graph 
graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_node("4")
graph.add_node("2")
graph.add_edge("4", "2")

# convert to pyg
data = from_networkx(graph)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thanks!!

		Thanks for this issue. It is correct that from_networkx currently expects consecutive numbers as node indices. This should be fixed and I will work on it :)

		Fixed in master (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/commit/c0458f0c0fb84c27570d91c6a971e29109649fca&gt;c0458f0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
