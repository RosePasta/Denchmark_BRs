	<summary>apply transform on DynamicFAUST dataset</summary>
	<description>
when run the following code for:
dataset = DynamicFAUST(root=d_faust_path, subjects=subjects, categories=categories, transform=T.RandomShear(0.07))
dataset[0]
I get:

AssertionError: Node position matrix and transformation matrix have incompatible shape.

this is due to the fact that
transform() expect data['pos'] to be of shape [num_of_ponts, dim]
but DynamicFaust returns data['pos'] of shape [num_of_frames, num_of_ponts, dim]
is there another built-in way to use augmentations transform for this dataset?
Thanks!

		Thanks! We should definitely support broadcasting here. I will work on it, but feel free to open a PR if you like. In the meantime, you can implement your own transform to achieve this :)

		Thanks!
I would love to have your official implementation once it's ready.
(in the meanwhile I am editing it myself :))
