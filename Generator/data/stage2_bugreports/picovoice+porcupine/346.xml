	<summary>Porcupine Issue: Failed to archive iOS build (react-native)</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Archive without failing.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Actual behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Can't archive react-native build (demo), have the same error as in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine/issues/22&gt;#22&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

bitcode bundle could not be generated because '.../node_modules/@picovoice/porcupine-react-native/ios/pv_porcupine/libpv_porcupine.a(pv_porcupine.o)' was built without full bitcode. All object files and libraries for bitcode must be generated from Xcode Archive or Install build for architecture arm64
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 any updates on that?
As a temporary solution, I disabled bitcode in Build Settings for the whole project but this is the wrong way for production...

, the fix to the porcupine iOS lib has been merged in. On our end we're able to archive all of our demos. Please confirm this and we'll close the issue. Thanks for reporting!
