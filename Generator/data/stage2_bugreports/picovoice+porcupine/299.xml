	<summary>dotnet binding throws exception after checking incorrect directory for dlls</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

new Porcupine(modelPath, keywordPaths, sensitivities) should not throw an exception
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Actual behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

new Porcupine(modelPath, keywordPaths, sensitivities) throws Exception("the libpv_porcupine cannot be found.\nThis should be in the same folder as this or on a known path");
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to reproduce the behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Place porcupine libs and resources in bin folder
Set working directory to some directory outside of the bin folder
Porcupine throws an error, expecting the dlls to be in the working directory. Disabling this check from the Porcupine.cs binding file results in a successful initialization of Porcupine as the dlls are allowed to exist in the executing assembly folder, working directory, system folder, or on PATH.

		We've just released a new .NET SDK that should address this. You can install Porcupine through Nuget or use it directly from the repo. Feel free to also try out our &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine/tree/master/demo/dotnet&gt;.NET demos&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please let us know if you have any issues with the SDK!
