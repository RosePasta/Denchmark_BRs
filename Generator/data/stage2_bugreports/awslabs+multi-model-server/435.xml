	<summary>MMS Docker image insists on working directory being mxnet-model-server</summary>
	<description>
I wrote a small NLP app and (attempted to) deploy it using the official MMS Docker image.
I exported the model into a /model directory in the container. However, when I tried to launch MMS, it complained about not being able to find the artifacts (the symbol file, for example). I could get it to work only when I put all the artifacts (the *symbol.json file, the params file, and the signature) in the same directory as mxnet-model-server.
I cannot imagine that this is by design. What did I do wrong?

 : We would like to understand your scenario a little better. What service file are you using? How are you providing the symbol to load_checkpoint? the issue could be that the custom service file you have is not using the "model_dir"
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/mms/model_service/mxnet_model_service.py#L99&gt;https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/mms/model_service/mxnet_model_service.py#L99&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

If this isn't the case, could you share how you are providing models in the mms_app.conf file?

The service file is custom ... i.e., it is a subclass of MXNetBaseService
The load_checkpoint call is as follows:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;        sym, arg_params, aux_params = mx.model.load_checkpoint(self.model_name, self.epoch_num)
        self.mod = mx.mod.Module(symbol=sym, context=mx.gpu(0))
        self.mod.bind(for_training=False, data_shapes=[('data', (1, 20))], label_shapes=[('softmax_label', (1, ))])
        self.mod.set_params(arg_params, aux_params, allow_missing=True, allow_extra=True)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And here's the mms_app_gpu.conf:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;[MMS Arguments]
--models
sentiment=/models/sentiment.model
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that it's really all the artifacts that need to be in the mxnet-model-server directory ... not just the service file.
Thank you for responding.

 : The service file is passed a "model_dir" ... From the code snippet you posted, I don't see you appending "model_dir" to the model_name. You would need to do that for the service file to find artifacts in the "/model/*" directory. You could search for "model_dir" in the following file (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/mms/model_service/mxnet_model_service.py#L62&gt;https://github.com/awslabs/mxnet-model-server/blob/master/mms/model_service/mxnet_model_service.py#L62&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) . Do let us know if this doesn't solve the issue...

		Thank you ... that was indeed the issue.
