	<summary>Import mxnet throws libcudart error on non cuda linux hosts</summary>
	<description>
I am seeing

    self._handle = _dlopen(self._name, mode)
OSError: libcudart.so.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

When I try to import mxnet after doing a pip install from setup.py. This happens when I try to import "mxnet" in my python module. This doens't happen with mxnet-mkl and happens with mxnet-cu90mkl package on generic linux host.  We might need to change the default installation for linux.
Steps to recreate this issue on a linux machine:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;1. (testenv)$ pip install mxnet-cu90mkl
2. (testenv)$ python
3.  &gt;&gt;&gt; import mxnet
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		This issue, seems to appearing in CI as well, My recent pull request is failing in codebuild (linux base) due to the very same reason, any changes to the cu90mkl package recently??, the change was tested on many linux machines before, this seems to be something new. Will look into it

		Solution  :

deactivate the environment
edit the bashrc file like nano ~/.bashrc file &amp; add the cuda path to environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-9.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH and save
type the command  source ~/.bashrc
type the command  sudo ldconfig to reflect the changes for library to be seen by OS
done! activate the environment &amp; run python
import mxnet
Problem solved. I spent 1 whole day find the solution...
