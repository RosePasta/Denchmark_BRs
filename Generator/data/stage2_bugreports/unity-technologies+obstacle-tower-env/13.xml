	<summary>Unusually hard level?</summary>
	<description>
Playing by hand I hit level 15 and encountered a platform that started at natural floor level and then periodically descended. They key for the level was on a raised section of the room to the left of the screenshot.

It felt like there might have been a reversed sign somewhere and the platform was supposed to go up from ground level. Either that or there was a more complicated solution that I didn't immediately see. :)

,
Thanks for pointing this out. It is indeed a bug, and will be fixed in the next version of the binaries we publish.

		We've addressed this issue in our internal development version of Obstacle Tower, and the version of the binary released for the contest will contain this fix. As such I am closing this issue for now.
