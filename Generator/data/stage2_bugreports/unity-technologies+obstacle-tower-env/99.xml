Some seeds skip levels:
see video - &lt;denchmark-link:https://twitter.com/iAmVidyaGamer/status/1136867273057030144&gt;https://twitter.com/iAmVidyaGamer/status/1136867273057030144&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

so far I have found the following
Seed 5 - jumps from level 2 to level 4
Seed 1 - jumps from level 3 to level 5
Seed 1 - jumps from level 9 to level 11
Seed 38  - jumps from level 2 to level 4
Seed 38  - jumps from level 9 to level 11
Seed 52  - jumps from level 9 to level 11

		Thanks for pointing this out &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sohojoe&gt;@Sohojoe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It is indeed a serious bug, and likely impacting the scores on the leaderboard. I looked into it and have found the cause and made a fix. Once it has been reviewed, we will roll out a new version of the tower which addresses the issue.
I appreciate your persistence in tracking down the cause of the strange behavior you were seeing. Sending the specific seeds and floor numbers was especially helpful in allowing me to quickly replicate  the issue.

 - that's great to hear there is a fix so soon! I would never have thought to look into this had we not had the exchange on twitter!

		We've just pushed v2.2, which should address this issue. It may take a few hours for AICrowd to correspondingly update their evaluator build however, just fyi.
