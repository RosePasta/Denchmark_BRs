	<summary>Character does not move on some rotating obstacles (v1.1)</summary>
	<description>
Hi!
Maybe there is a bug in the new version (1.1) of environment (downloaded by link from Pull Request &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env/pull/34&gt;#34&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )
Some obstacles rotate with the character,

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Nirenamid&gt;@Nirenamid&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for pointing this out. We don't think it has much impact on agent behavior, but we will be addressing this in the Round 2 release.
