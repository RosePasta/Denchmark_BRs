	<summary>Problem with google.protobuf</summary>
	<description>
I thought everything was installed properly (Win 10 box, Python3.6 - no Anaconda).
I am getting this error when trying to run the notebook:
c:\users\chris\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\google\protobuf\descriptor.py in 
45   import binascii
46   import os
---&gt; 47   from google.protobuf.pyext import _message
48   _USE_C_DESCRIPTORS = getattr(_message, '_USE_C_DESCRIPTORS', False)
49
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.
a pip uninstall/install protobuf does not help.   Anyone encountered this error?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Christopheraburns&gt;@Christopheraburns&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I think you've done everything right here :-)
Looks like there's an issue with protobuf 3.6.1 on Windows: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/5046&gt;protocolbuffers/protobuf#5046&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

That's the latest version via PyPI: &lt;denchmark-link:https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/#history&gt;https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/#history&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

In the Github issue I linked, they mention Python version can be an issue.  Could you share your Python and protobuf versions?  You may need to upgrade Python.

		Python = 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 08:06:12) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]
Protobuf = 3.6.1
Thanks for the quick response.

		FYI - dropping down to Protobuf v3.6.0 via
pip uninstall protobuf
pip install protobuf==3.6.0
Seems to have fixed the problem for me.

		Glad that works out!  I think updating to Python 3.6.1 would also solve this problem.  I'll close this issue now but please let us know if you run into any more issues.
