		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sohojoe&gt;@Sohojoe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for pointing this out. The seeds for Round 2 are limited to 100. After the competition we will enable support for 10,000 seeds. That is what the documentation refers to. This is obviously misleading, and I will change it.
