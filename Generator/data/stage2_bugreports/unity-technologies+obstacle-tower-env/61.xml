	<summary>Cube's reset floor is in the air.</summary>
	<description>
Position resetting floor/tile of a cube is sometimes in the air.
Is this expected?

In my case, it was above of a high-level ground (extruded floor).
My environment is macOS 10.14.3, v1.2 and played by myself.
also it might be another issue or is expected, but sometimes if I touch the reset floor, the cube which I did not touch moves to different position which seems to be an initial position.
( I'm not sure on this. It just might be my imagination or something...)

		It seems it is always in the air if the reset floor is placed on the high-level ground.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/a-maumau&gt;@a-maumau&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for pointing this out. It is indeed a bug, and we will work to fix it in the next release.

This one might be related.

I believe so. Both are related to the cube and it's reset area not being placed correctly. This will be addressed in the Round 2 release.

		I opened &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env/issues/80&gt;#80&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for the cube-stuck-in-floor bug. Didn't see that it was mentioned in this issue until now.

		Hi all. These issues should be addressed in the v2.0 release. Please re-open the thread if they are still occuring.
