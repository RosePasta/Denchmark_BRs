	<summary>A default value needs to be assigned to iter for Resnet CTC training</summary>
	<description>
For Resnet CTC training,  I think 
--iter=500
 used to be there in the config file. However, now it is not there anymore:

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/master/recipes/sota/2019/librispeech/train_am_resnet_ctc.cfg&gt;https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/master/recipes/sota/2019/librispeech/train_am_resnet_ctc.cfg&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

And it sounds that there is no built-in assignment for 
iter
 either. So, when one runs the training, he will get:

--iter=9223372036854775807
which is maximum value for a 64-bit signed integer. My understanding is that
500
might not be quite correct value for  
iter
 It sounds that another default value needs to be assigned to it instead.

: If  flag is not provided, max int value is assigned as defined in :
DEFINE_int64(iter, std::numeric_limits&lt;int64_t&gt;::max(), "number of updates");
Idea is to let the training run loop forever and monitor the loss on dev datasets and use early stopping when the loss starts plateauing.
