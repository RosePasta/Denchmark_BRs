Hi Facebook team, I have encountered the following error while building wav2letter
-- flashlight found (include:  lib: flashlight::flashlight )
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:103 (message):
flashlight must be build in distributed mode for wav2letter++
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
See also "/home/ishan/Vscode/wav2letter/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log".
This is same error mentioned in following link,

I have built Flashlight with the following command:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFLASHLIGHT_BACKEND=CPU -DFL_BUILD_DISTRIBUTED=ON
and building wav2letter with following command.
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DW2L_CRITERION_BACKEND=CPU
