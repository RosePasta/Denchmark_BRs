	<summary>Python bindings failed to build</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Bug Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Hi, I could not build python bindings for wav2letter. I have tried multiple environments to make sure. Not sure what the issue is, I was able to successfully build bindings in the past but reinstalled recently after the switch from v0.2.
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Reproduction Steps&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Installed wav2letter using -b v0.2 and flashlight -b v0.2 cuda backends.
KenLM was installed using both provided commands and just cmake .. -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON.
KenLM was built and 'cp -r kenlm /opt' , KENLM_ROOT_DIR=/opt/kenlm
I tried to build using both PyTorch 1.2.0 and 1.6.0
That said I am still experiencing the same error messages as seen in the log below.
Log below uses PyTorch 1.2.0, python 3.7
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Platform and Hardware&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Ubuntu 18.04, V100

		This probably connected to the compiler, you can fix this with adding  in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/v0.2/bindings/python/setup.py#L82&gt;https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/v0.2/bindings/python/setup.py#L82&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I tried it but it didn't change the error message. I'm confused because it was working before, but when I reinstalled on another VM, it also produced the same error message.

		<comment id='3' author='many-hats' date='2020-10-08T07:07:26Z'>
		just to be sure, you added -fPic, removed the build dir and run again pip install -e ., right?
		</comment>
		<comment id='4' author='many-hats' date='2020-10-08T12:12:24Z'>
		Yes, I replaced line 82 in the setup.py with env["CXXFLAGS"] = '{} -fPIC -DVERSION_INFO=\\"{}\\"'.format( , removed build dir, and did pip install -e . .

		could you try the same thing in the docker so that I could repro. What is also your cmake version?
cc &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jacobkahn&gt;@jacobkahn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 any idea on the fPIC issue?

		<comment id='6' author='many-hats' date='2020-10-20T19:54:50Z'>
		cmake version 3.10.2. Docker cuda-latest building python bindings worked fine however. Will use those for now.

		Seems there is some problems with conda gtest version and the one we use (it should be downloaded automatically). Could you try to use clean python env (without conda)?

		<comment id='8' author='many-hats' date='2020-10-21T00:44:32Z'>
		I tried a venv and without also with the '-fPIC' fix and without but got the same error. FWIW I also ran into problems with conda gtest when building a while ago but it was fixed when I uninstalled and only used the build gtest.

		<comment id='9' author='many-hats' date='2020-10-22T06:49:11Z'>
		probably there is another version in your system of gtest which creates all this mess.

		Was this ever fixed? Thanks! I'm running into the same issue and the proposed workaround on setup.py:82 didn't do it.
Any ideas?

		<comment id='11' author='many-hats' date='2021-01-21T14:49:36Z'>
		I was not able to fix this. I tried using system gtest and a clean build gtest install. I will take another stab with Flashlight

 Make sure you have the same version of gcc, g++ and gfortran, at least the major version.

		All were 7.5.0 . I'd recommend using the dockerfile, as v0.2 seems to have been archived and after some point I couldn't reproduce without it.

		<comment id='14' author='many-hats' date='2021-01-21T16:35:36Z'>
		Yep, v0.2 is archived, we have merged all code base wav2letter into flashlight and improved there python binding and installation recently. Please if you can switch to latest flashlight master and use &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight/tree/master/bindings/python&gt;https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight/tree/master/bindings/python&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (if you have any issues with it please post in flashlight issues directly). Otherwise, please use docker for v0.2 python bindings (or try to replicate docker env on your machine).
