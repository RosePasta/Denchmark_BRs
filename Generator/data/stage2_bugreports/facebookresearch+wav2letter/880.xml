	<summary>CMake Error: Target "SerializeConvLM" links to target "Threads::Threads" but the target  was not found</summary>
	<description>
An error occurs when I run cmake, reporting that Target "SerializeConvLM" links to target "Threads::Threads" but the target  was not found:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ cmake ..

-- OpenMP found
-- ArrayFire found (include: /home/jz/src/arrayfire/include, library: ArrayFire::afcuda)
-- flashlight found (include:  lib: flashlight::flashlight )
-- flashlight/app/asr is found.
-- flashlight/lib is found.
-- Configuring done

CMake Error at recipes/utilities/convlm_serializer/CMakeLists.txt:3 (add_executable):
  Target "SerializeConvLM" links to target "Threads::Threads" but the target
  was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED
  target, or an ALIAS target is missing?

CMake Error at recipes/self_training/pseudo_labeling/CMakeLists.txt:3 (add_executable):
  Target "analyze_pseudo_label_dataset" links to target "Threads::Threads"
  but the target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for
  an IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I noticed that there is no Serialization.h under my flashlight/app/asr/runtime:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ pwd
/home/jz/src/flashlight/install/include/flashlight/app/asr/runtime

$ ls
Helpers.h  Logger.h  Optimizer.h  runtime.h  SpeechStatMeter.h
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Some settings of the CMakeLists.txt of flashlight:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;option(FL_BUILD_TESTS "Build tests" OFF)
option(FL_BUILD_EXAMPLES "Build examples" OFF)
option(FL_BUILD_EXPERIMENTAL "Build internal experimental components" OFF)
option(FL_BUILD_SCRIPTS "Build internal scripts for wav2letter++" ON)
option(FL_BUILD_RECIPES "Build recipes" ON)
option(FL_BUILD_CORE_ONLY "Build flashlight core only" OFF)
option(FL_BUILD_LIBRARIES_ONLY "Build flashlight libraries only" OFF)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Could you try again from the master (we recently had sent the fix and improvement in cmake)?

Thanks for replying. I just updated and rebuilt both wav2letter++ and flashlight, but the same problem occurred. ðŸ˜­

 sorry for the delayed follow-up; fix should work as of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight/commit/7990a3d538bdf814a0a34b9c8e62384d1ee75e5e&gt;facebookresearch/flashlight@7990a3d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in flashlight and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/commit/66e72a5acf1884019a2428e54e8cf9a477863bb6&gt;66e72a5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in wav2letter.
