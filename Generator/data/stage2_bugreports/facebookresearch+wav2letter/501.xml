	<summary>simple_streaming_asr_example uses too much memory for large wav files.</summary>
	<description>
The wav file is 17 minutes long.
It started to recognize properly and worked fine. But memory usage continues to grow until server memory is exhausted.
When the previous audio part is recognized, can the previously used memory be automatically released?

		We are debugging this as a memory leak, will update you once we release a fix.

		Should have been solved with commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/commit/7a9696dc2f7518642a3f1908d6ed298901e108c0&gt;7a9696d&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Worked!
Completed converting audio input file=/root/host/2.wav to text... elapsed time=489 seconds
Memory occupancy is stable and there seems to be no memory leak.
Thank you.
