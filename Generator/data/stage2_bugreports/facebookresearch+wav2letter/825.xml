	<summary>Maybe sota/2019/raw_lm_corpus/get_titles.py has a bug</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I found that the parameter  did not work when passed to the subfuction  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/v0.2/recipes/models/sota/2019/raw_lm_corpus/get_titles.py#L49&gt;https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/v0.2/recipes/models/sota/2019/raw_lm_corpus/get_titles.py#L49&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Maybe adding  to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/v0.2/recipes/models/sota/2019/raw_lm_corpus/get_titles.py#L48&gt;https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/blob/v0.2/recipes/models/sota/2019/raw_lm_corpus/get_titles.py#L48&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can make the parameter  work.
Maybe it was because of my inconsistent operation that I found the problem. If this is not a bug, please ignore it. THX.

		did you specify the python running script with flag --cachepath? if no, then it will be empty.

		Yes, I had given specific --cachepath when running script. But it did not work (It was empty). Then I added global CACHE_PATH before CACHE_PATH = args.cachepath. It worked.

		I see now. Correct, this is python behaviour on global var change. Thanks for reporting this, will send a quick fix for this.
