	<summary>Binarization with DoReFa-Net</summary>
	<description>
This issue is about &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/NervanaSystems/distiller/blob/master/distiller/quantization/clipped_linear.py#L139&gt;DorefaParamsBinarizationSTE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.sign&gt;torch.sign()&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 returns one of three possible values: {-1, 0, 1} .   I think this isn't binarization.

		You're correct, this is a bug indeed. When the input is 0 the output should be 1.
So, could be something like:
output = torch.where(input == 0, torch.ones_like(input), torch.sign(input)) * E
If you'd like to try and test this and submit a quick PR that'll be great. Otherwise I'll try to get to it soon.

		Another option would be:
output = input.sign() * E
output[output == 0] = 1
Not sure if there would be a performance difference between the two.

		Thank you for your quick response.
Could you wait for a couple of days ?
