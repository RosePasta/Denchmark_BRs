	<summary>travis CRON job fails due to connection timeout in Autopilot test</summary>
	<description>
It seems that travis CRON jobs are failing due to a connection timeout in the Autopilot test when trying to download this file (for example see here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/sockeye/jobs/423743734#L6676&gt;https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/sockeye/jobs/423743734#L6676&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Looks like the Stanford NLP site that hosts the files is down.  I added &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye/pull/523&gt;#523&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to route around this.
