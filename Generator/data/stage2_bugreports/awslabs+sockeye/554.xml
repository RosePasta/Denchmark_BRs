	<summary>passing source factors in JSON file triggers error</summary>
	<description>
When specifying source factors using the "factors" field in a JSON file, translate.py shows an error suggesting source factor files are not provided.
This seems to be triggered by line 147 in translate.py:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;check_condition(translator.num_source_factors == len(inputs),  "Model(s) require %d factors, but %d given (through --input and --input-factors)." % (translator.num_source_factors, len(inputs)))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After commenting out this line, the inference is performed properly with lexical constraints and source factors. This might be cause by a lack of official support for JSON file input -- right now, passing a file containing serialized JSON objects works as intended with "--json-input".

		good point. This check only makes sense, when the input is not json.
