	<summary>Compatibility with python 3.5 and 3.7</summary>
	<description>
PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch/pull/331&gt;#331&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 fixes an issue with python 3.5 dict ordering. There are additional test errors with python 3.5 which should be fixed (it is the default python version on Ubuntu 16.04). When doing this we should also test python version 3.7. Additionally we should think about testing different python versions directly (e.g. using Travis).

		Those are the issues I found with Python 3.5:

PosixPath does not work with open (only changed in 3.6).
The test for the error message here depends on dictionary order, the solution is probably to sort the unexpected_kwargs before passing them to the error message.

		We are explicitly testing for python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 so any issues should get detected.
