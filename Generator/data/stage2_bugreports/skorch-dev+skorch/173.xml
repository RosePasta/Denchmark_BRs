<bug id='173' author='benjamin-work' open_date='2018-04-11T07:50:25Z' closed_time='2018-05-14T07:34:27Z'>
	<summary>scoring callbacks fail with sklearn make_scorer</summary>
	<description>
Using a scoring callback with make_scorer fails:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, make_scorer

net = NeuralNetClassifier(..., callbacks=[('accuracy', BatchScoring(make_scorer(accuracy)))])
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The reason is that the name of the make_scorer object cannot be determined. To mitigate this, pass the name argument to the scoring callback.
This bug is especially annoying as users might believe it is possible to pass an sklearn metric as scoring function, which fails with the prompt to use make_scorer, which will then fail with the error above.
