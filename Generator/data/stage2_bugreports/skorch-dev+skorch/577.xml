	<summary>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'packaging' after installing skorch</summary>
	<description>
I recently installed skorch package. I installed it in a conda virtual environment using the installation guidance with conda:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    git clone https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch.git
    cd skorch
    python setup.py install
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, when I run  it throws me the packaging error:

I followed the solution suggested in this &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/hangtwenty/b9820fe204eebb0cc5b9aba49f3c8b22&gt;page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but I still get the error. I have python 3.7.5 installed under this conda environment and I didn't get this error before installing skorch.

		Does conda install packaging help?
Otherwise, can you install skorch from pip? We had a very recent release, so installing from source gives you almost no additional features.

		Thank you for your reply! I used "conda install -c conda-forge skorch" after I posted this issue and it worked.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to try your solution.
