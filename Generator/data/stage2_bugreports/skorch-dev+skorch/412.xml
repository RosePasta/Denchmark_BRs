	<summary>conda package cant find requirements.txt</summary>
	<description>
Having a problem over at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/conda-forge/skorch-feedstock/pull/2&gt;conda-forge/skorch-feedstock#2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Processing $SRC_DIR
  Created temporary directory: /tmp/pip-req-build-op7959fv
  Added file://$SRC_DIR to build tracker '/tmp/pip-req-tracker-3oildf45'
  Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip-req-build-op7959fv/setup.py) egg_info for package from file://$SRC_DIR
    Running command python setup.py egg_info
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      File "/tmp/pip-req-build-op7959fv/setup.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
        with open('requirements.txt') as f:
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

...and indeed the requirements.txt doesn't seem to be in the pypi tar.gz meaning the setup.py can't be run from the sdist.
I think requirements.txt needs to be in the MANIFEST.in?

		That sounds like the problem, do you want to create a PR?

		I'm on holiday until the new year so will be unlikely to find the time before then. Happy to do so if no one has beaten me to it though...
