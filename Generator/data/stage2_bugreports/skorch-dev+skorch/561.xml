	<summary>PyTroch &amp;gt;= 1.1.0 scheduler.step() change</summary>
	<description>
Not sure if this has been mentioned yet. This isn't critical to functionality but would be nice to address - warning message arises when any lr scheduler is turned on:
UserWarning: Detected call of `lr_scheduler.step()` before `optimizer.step()`. In PyTorch 1.1.0 and later, you should call them in the opposite order: `optimizer.step()` before `lr_scheduler.step()`.  Failure to do this will result in PyTorch skipping the first value of the learning rate schedule.See more details at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate "https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate", UserWarning)

		Thanks for highlighting this.
This was first discussed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch/issues/467&gt;#467&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but the step order was not changed then since we didn't bump the minimum PyTorch version for skorch (to avoid problems with pre-1.1.0 releases).
This is something we should address now as our requirement is PyTorch &gt;=1.1.0.

		Nevermind me, this was already addressed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch/commit/af04b559445a76da33a2750ff630dee2749402d3&gt;af04b55&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and there are only some warnings that are from tests that don't call  (for good reason).
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mshuaibii&gt;@mshuaibii&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Can you tell us which skorch/PyTorch version you are using and how you triggered this behavior?

I'm on PyTorch version 1.3.0 and skorch version 0.5.0.post0. Just noticed skorch is on version 0.6.0 so haven't tested that out to see if the issue is resolved. But to replicate - I defined a LRScheduler callback in the NeuralNetRegressor.

		Yes, please do test with skorch 0.6 - this is probably going to resolve your problem.

Yup - 0.6.0 took care of it. Thanks!
