	<summary>[BUG] TrainEndCheckpoint not working with LoadInitState</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to use TrainEndCheckpoint with LoadInitState but it's not working. It doesn't even return any error as you are using with suppress(Exception). The suppressed error is *** AttributeError: 'TrainEndCheckpoint' object has no attribute 'f_history_', yet the file exists and self.checkpoint.checkpoint_.f_history_==.../train_end_history.json'.
I think the issue is that  stopped inheriting from  in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/skorch-dev/skorch/pull/463&gt;#463&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I.e. it doesn't have a  attribute anymore. This could be simply resolved by redirecting  to .
