	<summary>item_id_to_variable_map, variable_ranges.csv inconsistencies</summary>
	<description>
Currently, names for variables are inconsistent between the two. For example, item_id_to_variable_map.csv has a variable called "Heart Rate" while variable_ranges.csv has a variable called "Heart rate". This may not seem like much, but it is enough for clean functions and range checking functions to fail to recognize the same variable; a new column called Heart rate is created and populated solely with the impute value (i.e. the assumed normal heart rate of 86 bpm).
Because of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks/issues/25&gt;#25&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the issue is not too important in the current implementation, but it should be considered if remove_outliers_for_variables is ever run on the data.
