	<summary>[BUG] lightgbm could not be found in Jupyter</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

I could import lightgbm in forecast env.
I could also import it while using python 3 kernel in jupyter.
However, I could not import it using forecast kernel in jupyter.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 Thanks for reporting this issue. I'll look into it. This could be due to the forecast kernel in Jupyter notebook is not successfully configured although I haven't seen such issue before. Once the kernel is set up it should include lightgbm as we have it in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/forecasting/blob/staging/tools/environment.yml&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/forecasting/blob/staging/tools/environment.yml&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We've resolved this issue by removing the kernel via
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;jupyter kernelspec uninstall forecasting_env
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

from Jupyter and re-running the following command
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python -m ipykernel install --user --name forecasting_env
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
