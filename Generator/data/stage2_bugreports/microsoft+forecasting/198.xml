		Hello, thank you for reporting this.
Can you please double check the version of the scrapbook module you have installed? If you followed the setup instructions, a conda environment forecasting_env is created from the tools/environment.yaml file. In this file we're installing a specific version of scrapbook module, nteract-scrapbook==0.3.1, so this is the version that should be installed. We also provide instructions on how to register this environment as a Jupyter kernel, so the installed packages are accessible from the notebooks. Could you confirm that you followed these steps?
If you open a python session in the environment forecasting_env created from the yaml file, and try running the following few commands, this is what the output should look like:

		Sorry, I installed the library in the wrong way. Now I've installed it the right way and it's ready to use. I sincerely thank you for your help.
And the right way to install the library is pip install nteract-scrapbook==0.3.1ã€‚
