	<summary>[BUG] forecasting or forecast</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The repo's name is forecasting.
There is a directory called forecasting_lib.
conda env is called forecast
In addition, the Jupyter kernel is called forecast.
I don't know if most people would prefer to have a single name (e.g., forecast).  Would be good to interview users and make a call.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
