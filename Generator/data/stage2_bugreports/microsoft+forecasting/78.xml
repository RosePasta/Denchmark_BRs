	<summary>[BUG] Unable to execute "./tools/environment_setup.sh" in Windows Command Prompt</summary>
	<description>
This is regarding the required command ./tools/environment_setup.sh as part of the environment setup process.
.sh/shell scripts are batch files for Linux/Unix. So Windows Users would either have to use Ubuntu Terminal or WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) but the easiest way would be to either make a powershell .ps1 script or a Windows Batch .bat script.
