	<summary>[BUG] Most recent pmdarima causes version conflicts, setup problems</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The latest pmdarima is 1.6.1 as of 2020-06-27, which requires numpy &gt;= 1.17.3 and scikit-learn &gt;= 0.22. The forecasting_env environment pins these to 1.16.2 and 0.20.3 respectively. This also impacts new setup, as the tools/environment_setup.sh script aborts when the error is encountered, leaving the setup half-done.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Have a fresh Ubuntu VM or local machine
Clone the repo
Execute the setup commands

Notice the following lines in the output:



&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: pmdarima 1.6.1 has requirement numpy&gt;=1.17.3, but you'll have numpy 1.16.2 which is incompatible.
ERROR: pmdarima 1.6.1 has requirement scikit-learn&gt;=0.22, but you'll have scikit-learn 0.20.3 which is incompatible.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The rest of the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/forecasting/blob/master/tools/environment_setup.sh&gt;setup script&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 after after line 14 is not executed, so eg fclib and ray are not installed.
