	<summary>[BUG] examples: oj_retail</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

The examples directory has a subdirectory called oj_retail.  The name probably could be optimized to better reflect the use case we are trying to highlight.  Are there keywords we want to cover in here? retail? grocery? perishable goods?  I would not think OJ really signifies anything here.
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;How do we replicate the bug?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected behavior (i.e. solution)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 Thanks for the comments. Currently we name each use case folder under  directory after . OJ here represents Orange Juice dataset.
We could remove oj and purely name the folder after the use case, e.g., grocery_sales or retail_sales. This may cause conflict when we want to add two datasets for a same use case. We will further discuss the naming of these folders and make necessary changes.
