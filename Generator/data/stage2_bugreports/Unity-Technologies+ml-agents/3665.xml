	<summary>Migrating.md document missing an entry for v0.15.0</summary>
	<description>
Not really a bug, but I wanted to point out a missing entry in the Migrating.md file in the docs:
The academy functions "EnableAutomaticStepping()/DisableAutomaticStepping()" were made private and instead one must use "AutomaticSteppingEnabled = true/false".
I found the entry by skimming through the academy code relatively easily, but this should still be added to the docs to make migrating easier.
Thanks for the Help.

		Thanks for catching this. It's in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/com.unity.ml-agents/CHANGELOG.md&gt;changelog&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ("Automatic stepping for Academy is now controlled from the AutomaticSteppingEnabled property") but I forgot to put it in the Migration Guide.
