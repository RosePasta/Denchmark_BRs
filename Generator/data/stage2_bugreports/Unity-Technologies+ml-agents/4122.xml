	<summary>Ray Perception Sensor 2D (gizmos not working)</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I am trying to use Ray Perception Sensor 2D.  It doesn't look like the gizmo to draw debug information is working properly.  Please see screenshot.

The sphere is visible and changes size, but it's always on top of the agent.  The 3D version seems to work correctly and shows the rays.  The 2D version is always red (hit) and always on top of the agent (I never see the rays).

		Nevermind, I misunderstood the interaction with colliders.
