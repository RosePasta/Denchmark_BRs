Can't build for iOS
I get a lot of errors like:

Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/DemonstrationStore.cs(3,7): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'Google' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)

Barracuda is installed 0.3.2-preview
Unity 2019.2.17 and 2018.4.14 both have the same errors
macOS Catalina 10.15.1
ml agents 0.12.1 #latest_release
TensorFlow 1.7.1
I tried to build the project with custom environment or with just empty project with UnitySDK only
I tried with and without the ENABLE_TENSORFLOW Scripting defined symbol
I selected .NET 4.x
I successfully trained the network on my Mac, but I can't build the project for iOS. I want to train bots for my game and use the behaviour in iOS game.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Go to File-&gt;Build settings-&gt;Build
See a lot of errors in the console right after click

I have 145 errors in the console. There are some of them:

Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Grpc/CommunicatorObjects/AgentAction.cs(8,20): error CS0400: The type or namespace name 'Google' could not be found in the global namespace (are you missing an assembly reference?)


Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Grpc/CommunicatorObjects/AgentAction.cs(10,21): error CS0400: The type or namespace name 'Google' could not be found in the global namespace (are you missing an assembly reference?)


Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Grpc/CommunicatorObjects/AgentAction.cs(9,21): error CS0400: The type or namespace name 'Google' could not be found in the global namespace (are you missing an assembly reference?)


Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Grpc/CommunicatorObjects/BrainParameters.cs(173,28): error CS0115: 'BrainParametersProto.ToString()': no suitable method found to override


Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Grpc/CommunicatorObjects/DemonstrationMeta.cs(137,26): error CS0115: 'DemonstrationMetaProto.Equals(object)': no suitable method found to override

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chechulinYuri&gt;@chechulinYuri&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Could you turn off  in your Xcode project?  This may prevent these build errors from popping up.  We are tracking a similar issues for ML-Agents not working with IL2CPP, and this sounds related.  Thanks for your feedback.

  thank you for the reply, but there is nothing similar with my issue.

Could you turn off dead code stripping in your Xcode project

I don't have an Xcode project because errors pop up right after I press the Build button in unity

		I think the issue should be opened because I don't have any solution for my problem

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chechulinYuri&gt;@chechulinYuri&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Have you installed the Barracuda plugin from package manager?  It includes the google protobuf library and is required for ml-agents to work.

Please refer to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/3167&gt;#3167&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,  It seems to be a barracuda related issue.  My apologies for the miscategorization.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chechulinYuri&gt;@chechulinYuri&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
This was fixed in barracuda version 0.6.0-preview.  You can find their changelong &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@0.6/changelog/CHANGELOG.html&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and will be in the 0.15.0 release of ML-Agents.
