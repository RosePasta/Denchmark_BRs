	<summary>3DBallHard environment seems a little different from v0.9.x ? Convergence stability problem.</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
when I train agents in 3DBallHard of ml-agents v0.10.x, it seems not convergence stablely like v0.9.x. I want to know if there are other differences between these two version except the "apparence" of agents.
I have tried DDPG+LSTM and SAC+LSTM to train 3DBallHard env both of v0.9.x and of 0.10.x. And I set stacked_vectors to 1, max_step to 2500, decision_interval to 5.
The curve of the training result is like this, where smoothing set to 0 in tensorboard:

Blue represent training in v0.9.x, orange represent training in v0.10.x
I have conducted many comparative trials, so I'm pretty sure that there must be something different between these two environments. And I believe there doesn't have an RNN algorithm that could converenge stablely in 3DBallHard of ml-agents v0.10.x.
Hope you can do:

Use the official RNN to see if there is such a problem where stacked_vectors = 1 (I use my own code, but I believe the problem also exists because another person(@BlueFisher ) has encountered stability problems with his own RNN code.).
Hope offical provide a model of 3DBallHard where stacked_vectors = 1.
Plz check these two environments in detail. The  environment of new version does have convergence stability issues.

thanks. (sry for my bad grammer.)

		It seems experimentally that this effect can be achieved without using LSTM, but there is still the problem of convergence instability between v0.9.x and v0.10.x.
