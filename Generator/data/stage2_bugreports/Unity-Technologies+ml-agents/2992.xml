	<summary>Zero Brains (Agents/Policies) in getting_started notebook</summary>
	<description>

It looks like Brains are being transitioned into Agents &amp; Policies:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/2729&gt;#2729&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But I do not have access to the Design Doc for these changes
&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBhBxZ9lepGF4H6fc6Hu6AW7UwOmnyX3trmgI3HpOmo/edit#&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBhBxZ9lepGF4H6fc6Hu6AW7UwOmnyX3trmgI3HpOmo/edit#&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Issue:
There are 0 brains in the getting-started notebook

There is a reference to Brain in this Notebook:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/notebooks/getting-started.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/notebooks/getting-started.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm trying to run this notebook, and I have my environment executable file in the right place now.
But (based on my research), it looks like I need to set my Brain to "external"
The error is that there are 0 brains:
"Unity Academy name: Ball3DAcademy; Number of Training Brains : 0"
And the code expects at least one brain:
"env = UnityEnvironment(file_name=env_name); default_brain = env.external_brain_names[0]; brain = env.brains[default_brain]"
Notes:
I believe the resolution when Brain's existed was to make sure that the Brain was set to External and to set the Control tickmark, but I do not see any of those options in Unity's Ball3dAcademy example now. If Brain's no longer exist (as I'm understanding), then what is the solution to this now?
Environment (please complete the following information):

MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6
ML-Agents version: master (#1083) ; 0.11.0 ; 0.5.0a
TensorFlow version: Version: 1.15.0

		Hello,
I have got same problem in my ml-agent project. I found that the behaviorparameters has failed when :



ml-agents/UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Policy/BehaviorParameters.cs


        Lines 40 to 43
      in
      8a08bc4






 if (FindObjectOfType&lt;Academy&gt;().IsCommunicatorOn) 



 { 



 return new RemotePolicy(m_BrainParameters, m_BehaviorName); 



 } 





I also checked the Academy, It failed at :



ml-agents/UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs


        Lines 294 to 307
      in
      8a08bc4






 try 



 { 



 var unityRLInitParameters = Communicator.Initialize( 



 new CommunicatorInitParameters 



         { 



 version = k_ApiVersion, 



 name = gameObject.name, 



 environmentResetParameters = new EnvironmentResetParameters 



             { 



 resetParameters = resetParameters, 



 customResetParameters = customResetParameters 



             } 



         }); 



 Random.InitState(unityRLInitParameters.seed); 





It looks like ml-agent try to detect python process and result with an exception.
