	<summary>&amp;lt;Product Name&amp;gt; incompatible with mlagents-learn</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
The Unity Editor -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Product Name: "Unity Environment" is incompatible with mlagents-learn with build apps. ( for example mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --env=BuildFolder/Unity Environment.exe --run-id=RunIdentifier --train ).
The learning simply doesn't start without any warning or error message!
The Product Name should be "UnityEnvironment" instead of "Unity Environment".
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Use any example and try to train it with a build app and the default demo settings.

Console logs / stack traces
none
Environment (please complete the following information):

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TiNovTec&gt;@TiNovTec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 -- we regularly train builds with that product name, so I think it's unlikely that is what's causing the issue.  Does anything at all come up in the console after you enter your command?
One issue I see as a potential problem is that your .exe file is two words.  You may need to escape the space in your path to BuildFolder/Unity\ Environment.exe

		Yes, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/harperj&gt;@harperj&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It's the white space. And no, escaping doesn't work and wouldn't be user-friendly at all. So please just change the name to contain no white space! xD

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TiNovTec&gt;@TiNovTec&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, request noted to share with the team.  In the meantime you can create your build with a different name (without the space) or escape the space in a different way.  I think my suggestion of the forward slash was incorrect, on Windows I believe &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32457007/how-to-escape-space-in-file-path-in-windows-run&gt;you can escape with ^&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This was fixed in our examples in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3612&gt;#3612&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Closing this.
