	<summary>Cannot Build Unity Executables on Release 0.14 and 0.14.1</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I have migrated my project from 0.13 to 0.14 and then 0.14.1. The environment works fine in the Editor when I press play but when I want to build the executable, the build will finish with success but with the following errors:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;C:\Users\srezaeishoshtari\workspace\UnityProjects\fresh_clone\ml-agents\com.unity.ml-agents\Runtime\Sensor\CameraSensorComponent.cs(9,27): warning CS0109: The member 'CameraSensorComponent.camera' does not hide an accessible member. The new keyword is not required.

C:\Users\srezaeishoshtari\workspace\UnityProjects\fresh_clone\ml-agents\com.unity.ml-agents\Runtime\Policy\BehaviorParameters.cs(34,22): warning CS0649: Field 'BehaviorParameters.m_BehaviorType' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value 

Build completed with a result of 'Succeeded'
UnityEngine.GUIUtility:ProcessEvent(Int32, IntPtr) (at C:/buildslave/unity/build/Modules/IMGUI/GUIUtility.cs:179)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And when I execute the file, a broken empty environment starts (see attached image) starts.
At first, I thought the issue was with the migration of our project, but then I did a fresh clone of ml-agents (tried with both releases 0.14 and 0.14.1) and the exact same thing happens with the provided example environments.
This is the log file of when I launch the .exe file:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Mono path[0] = 'C:/Users/srezaeishoshtari/workspace/UnityProjects/fresh_clone/built/test/Unity Environment_Data/Managed'

The referenced script (SerializeAgent) on this Behaviour is missing!

The referenced script on this Behaviour (Game Object 'Agent') is missing!
 
(Filename: C:\buildslave\unity\build\Runtime/Mono/ManagedMonoBehaviourRef.cpp Line: 294)

A scripted object (probably SerializeAgent?) has a different serialization layout when loading. (Read 32 bytes but expected 44 bytes)
Did you #ifdef UNITY_EDITOR a section of your serialized properties in any of your scripts?

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Two files are missing which seem might be due to some Windows/Mac compatibility. The first half of the path to the file is in Windows format and the rest Unix.
I have tested on Unity 2018.4.17f1 and 2019.3.3f1. I never had such issues with ML-Agents 0.13. This seems like a bug to me or else I am missing some thing.
Thanks,
Sahand

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sahandrez&gt;@sahandrez&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
In the build dialog you need to add the open scene and remove this one.  I'll fix this for the next release.
