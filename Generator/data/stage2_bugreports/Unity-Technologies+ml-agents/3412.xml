	<summary>Raycast Debugging</summary>
	<description>
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
This seems to be intentional, but when using the "RayPerceptionSensor" component, it does not show the debug gizmos unless when training.
Describe the solution you'd like
I want to see my raycasts in realtime without having to start a seperate training process, i.e. controlling my agent using heuristics. I don't quite understand why this isn't possible or I might have missed something.
Describe alternatives you've considered
I've even tried starting a training process while forcing the agent to heuristic mode. This still does not display any raycast debugging.
I might have missed something, but this seems to be intentional. It shouldn't be hard to add a simple checkbox in the debug gizmos inspector for the ray perception component.
Thanks in advance, this would be a great help.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Xiromtz&gt;@Xiromtz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, you can see the raycasts during inference mode as well, but only in the scene view. But I was able to replicate that if you're using Heuristic the raycasts don't show. This seems like a bug, and I've logged it with internal tracking number MLA-622.

		Yeah, I forgot to mention that it also works in inference! But Inference obviously only works with a trained model, so I still can't test my implementation very well if I can't control the agent myself.
Thanks for the quick reply though!
I've never used this github feature; Should I close this thread, since you've logged the bug internally? Or will it be closed once the bug is fixed?

		Feel free to leave the issue open until the bug is fixed - we'll close it at that time. Thanks!

		Awesome, thanks for the help!
For anyone having the same problem and wanting to quickly test their raycasts via heuristic input:
A simple workaround is calling the heuristic function from the AgentAction function by replacing the action array.

		Just a followup on this - I just merged a &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3484&gt;#3484&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which (amongst other things) will draw the RayPerception gizmos whenever the Agent is selected (including non-play mode and using Heuristic behavior). It's on the master branch now and will be in the next release (in a few weeks).
This still doesn't run the sensors when using Heuristic behaviors (which is a larger discussion) but it should be enough to solve your original problem.
