	<summary>exe file hangs after training</summary>
	<description>
After training the exe file using jupyter notebook, the exe file hangs and I am not able to see the trained exe file. I am storing the weights of actor and critic in .pth file. I have tried training the tennis example, but facing the same issue.
Is there any way that I can generate .pb and .bytes model using jupyter notebook ?

 - can you provide your jupyter notebook?  and also what you mean by "trained exe file"?

		I have changed the scripts. It is solved. Now I am using this repo and this works fine.
