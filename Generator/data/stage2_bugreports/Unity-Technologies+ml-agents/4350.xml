	<summary>Strange behaviour when calling EndEpisode after Vector3.Distance check</summary>
	<description>
I have a rather convoluted means of restarting my training scenario when EndEpisode is called. (I think this is necessary to explain this because it might have something do with the bug). My environment and agents are restarted by a method in a scene-restarting class. This method is invoked after every agent in the scene has called OnEpisodeBegin. E.g. one agent calls EndEpisode, given an episode ending event, and then the academy calls each agents OnEpisodeBegin - when every agents OnEpisodeBegin has been called, the scene resetting method is invoked and everything is reset. This works fine in most instances.
However, one of my agents calls EndEpisode when it is close to another agent. This method is checked in OnActionRecieved:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;private bool CloseToAgent() =&gt;
        Vector3.Distance(_rigidbody.position,
                         InstanceController.Spy.GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody&gt;().position) &lt; 1.1f;
            
        
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

If true, the agents EndEpisode is called.
However, unlike all my other agents, calling EndEpisode here doesn't seem to trigger the academy to call every agents OnEpisodeBegin - it is only invoked in the agent with a true returned by CloseToAgent. OnEpisodeBegin is called repeatedly, so long as the agent remains close and the check returns true. As a result, restarting the the scene is temperamental (in my case). If this agent maintains the close distance, its OnEpisodeBegin is called enough times to restart the environment (if it is called as many times as there are agents in the scene), however a brush with the agent means that OnEpisodeBegin is not called enough times to restart the environment.
I hope this makes sense.
To reproduce set up a scene with two agents, and invoke one of their EndEpisodes through the same means as described above (with the check for distance method). Debug.Log the agent's OnEpisodeBegin - this should be invoked in just one agent.

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/HPRIOR&gt;@HPRIOR&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 can you provide more of the agent script as well as the debug.log file?  Trying to assess if this a bug in the implementation or something in the core ml-agents scripts.

		Sorry for wasting your time. It seems as though I was mistaken about the what happens when EndEpisode is invoked by an agent.  Re-reading the documentation I mistook the description of the environment setup in this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_3_docs/docs/Learning-Environment-Design.md&gt;document&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and the section 'The Simulation and Training Process', as the protocol for every time end episode was called - that every agents OnEpisodeBegin was called. It seems as though only the agent who called EndEpisode has it's OnEpisodeBegin called.
