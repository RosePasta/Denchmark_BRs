		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Sohojoe&gt;@Sohojoe&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, big thanks for spotting this issue! It's an error on our part in the release notes - the PR enabled the parameters to be passable when creating a  class, but it was never intended to pass down through . We're looking into doing this properly - but basically I would add a parameter to the docopt, turn it into a list of strings, and pass it into the  method in .

		This is fixed on develop and will be available in the next release. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/2594&gt;#2594&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
