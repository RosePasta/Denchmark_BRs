	<summary>Strange behaviour with --load</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I've been trying to do some very long training setups for complex continuous control problems, and due to moving around I've had to interrupt a fair amount of times, necessitating loading from where I left off sometimes. it all looks good, but when I load it says it's loading from an incorrect model (i.e. not the latest one, see the screenshot)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37209327/38187569-cca3e43c-368a-11e8-811a-2665c0374dd5.PNG&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Note it says "restoring parameters from 1 million steps" even though training is at 50 million steps.
Visually it seems that it is in fact loading the correct model, but it's hard to tell with 100% certainty that it is in fact the very latest model that is being loaded. Is it just a filename bug when saving the model, or a display bug, or something else that's happening here? I did not confirm whether in fact that filename corresponds to "amount of steps since last load" which might make sense in this case.
Thanks!

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ruanrothmann&gt;@ruanrothmann&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , you could check the checkpoint file under the models folder, and the "model_checkpoint_path" should tell you which model it is loading when you pass the --load flag.
