	<summary>Why is agent class instantiated twice?</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When printing some tensor shapes from model.py I observed that lines were printed out twice. Found this strange, and when debugging c# saw that the agent class is instantiated twice. I'm using ml-agents15, and this wasn't the case in ml-agents14.
Can this be a bug?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MarkTension&gt;@MarkTension&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
We don’t instantiate your agents for you.  I’m not sure why there are two  variables in your debugger.  Did you add a watch for ?  Could you add breakpoints in your initialize method in your Agent?
Are you using the gym wrapper in python?

 Aah Daim. You're right. I'm foolish and accidentally added a watch for this. Thank you for pointing out
