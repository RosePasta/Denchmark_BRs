	<summary>.demo File Metadata</summary>
	<description>
When I open the ml-agents Project in Unity and select one of the .demo files, I cannot see the metadata in the inspector. It has stopped showing me this.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Open Project folder with Unity  (2018.4.16f)
Go to one of the example demos (Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/Demos/Expert3DBall.demo
Select it to see it in the Inspector Window
I see blank

I did notice there's a "Missing Mono Script" - I am wondering if that's the problem where is said script and how to add it?
Environment:

Windows 10
ML-Agents version: ML-Agents v0.14.1 (latest_release)
TensorFlow version: 2.0.0
Environment: 3DBall (and all others honestly)

		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Cpache1&gt;@Cpache1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I've tried to reproduce this issue with no luck, the necessary  script is present after a fresh clone of the repository. The script your missing is located here , but I would suggest re-cloning the repo as a whole to make sure you're not actually missing the file

		I did have the script, although I don't understand why it wasn't doing what it was supposed to? I just downloaded the repo and copied over the "Project" folder. It fixed it. Thanks!
