	<summary>cannot import name 'UnityEnvironment' from 'mlagents.envs'</summary>
	<description>
I just updated to Beta 0.10.0 and I noticed that the file init.py in mlagents/envs was empty. I recevied error cannot import name 'UnityEnvironment' from 'mlagents.envs' when running from mlagents.envs import UnityEnvironment. Is that a bug or mlagents changed the import way?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/BlueFisher&gt;@BlueFisher&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/StepNeverStop&gt;@StepNeverStop&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which install method are you using? Are you installing from pip or from source? We haven't changed the imports from 0.9.2 in 0.10.0.

		I installed it using Anaconda on Windows, Python 3.6.1. I followed the installation guide in the repo. The error appears when I ran the getting_started notebook in Jupyter. I ran some of the demos in Unity and things seemed to work fine.

		Got it, I think I know what's going on. We'll look at the issue in more depth, but for now you should be able to import it by using from mlagents.envs.environment import UnityEnvironment.
