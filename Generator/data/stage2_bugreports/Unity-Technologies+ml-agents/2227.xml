Describe the bug
I'm using Unity 2019.1 on Windows when I start multiple environments on a built exe everything seems fine, when monitoring the multiple Unity environments with Task Manager they all show about the same percentage of CPU usage, but after a few thousand steps one environment is at 25% and the rest are at 0% and they never recover.
I've tried with lots of numbers of environments but it seems always the same. Is anyone else getting this issue?
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

train with multiple environments and monitor the different processes using task manager
