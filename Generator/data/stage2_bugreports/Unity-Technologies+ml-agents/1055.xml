	<summary>Memory problem during training</summary>
	<description>
Hey,
I'm trying to train my Unity project with ml-agents, using PPO. Training process seems to go well, but Unity process increases memory usage until saturation. It's strange because my computer has 32 G of RAM.

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alessiabertugli&gt;@alessiabertugli&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - hope you are doing well.  I am not aware of any existing issue on memory leaks.  Can you provide a few more details - 1) did you make any changes to python 2) which enviornments (or your own) 3) any logs or screenshots you can provide.  For now, I'll classify this as a bug until we can debug your issue.  Thanks.

		I've seen memory issues when not using object pooling and generating a very high number of objects. In this case, my training process eventually crashed.
Adding an object pooling routine fixed it.
Unity 2018 r2

		I didn't make any change to python code. It's unity build that give memory leak. I'm using my own environment, but I don't generate objects, I just change their transform position and rotation when they collide with another collider.

		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alessiabertugli&gt;@alessiabertugli&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to confirm - if you try to do training in the editor, can you run the Unity profiler to see where the memory leak is happening?

  are you using visual observation?
I also have memory leak issue, but after upgrade to version 0.4b, the issue is solved.
