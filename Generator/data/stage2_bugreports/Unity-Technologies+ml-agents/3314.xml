	<summary>com.unity.ml-agents package missing in latest_release branch</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
After providing the file link in UnitySDK/Packages/manifest.json, the editor spits an error saying that it doesn't recognise the package.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Clone the repo as shown in the Installation guide.
Observe that no directory called com.unity.ml-agents exist.
Try cloning the master/checking out to master.
Observe that the directory exists, and once provided in the manifest.json file, the ML-Agents package is detected succesfully.

Console logs / stack traces
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  Project has invalid dependencies:
    com.unity.ml-agents: The file [C:\dev\UnityProjects\ml-agents\com.unity.ml-agents\package.json] cannot be found

A re-import of the project may be required to fix the issue or a manual modification of C:/dev/UnityProjects/ml-agents/UnitySDK/Packages/manifest.json file.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
