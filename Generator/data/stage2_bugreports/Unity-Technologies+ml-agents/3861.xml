	<summary>CSV summaries are overwritten</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
When pausing and returning to the same training session via the --load parameter, the model is resumed and everything is summarized into a single graph in TensorBoard.
When looking at the .csv files though, I can only see a single file for my current training session. This single file seems to be overwritten everytime I resume training via --load.
Now the solution would be to simply move the .csv somewhere else before using --load, but this seems cumbersome and I have a lot of training data I want to output to matlab.
For now, it looks like TensorBoard supports converting charts to .csv.
Still, the mlagents-learn outputted .csv getting overwritten looks to be a bug.

		Hi,
We were able to reproduce this issue. Unfortunately, we plan to deprecate the CSV export of data in a later release so we will not be addressing this issue now.
Like you said, it is possible to directly download the CSV from tensorboard if that is a suitable substitute. For other users looking for a substitute : Check the Show data download links on tensorboard and you will be able to download a CSV for each curve.
