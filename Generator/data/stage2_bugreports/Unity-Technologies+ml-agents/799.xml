		It's always happened after I increased the 'max_steps'. What's wrong with it???

 First I used v1.4.0, then I updated it to be v1.8.0, the problem is still existed.

		It seems a problem of Tensorflow. &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/4177&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks for the report. Like you said this seems to be a TensorFlow issue (which is still open).  This issue has been inactive for a long time now so I'm going to close it for now.
