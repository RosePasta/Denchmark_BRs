	<summary>Getting '¤¤¤' instead of float in AgentAction</summary>
	<description>
I ran the training, which looks succesful. I then try to run it using an internal brain.
It works with some of the brains that I've tried, but not other times.
Sometimes the trained brain responds some weird chars that isn't a number: ¤¤¤
Is this how it's supposed to be, or is this a bug?
Using Unity 2017.2.0f3 on a Mac with osx version 10.11.6
