	<summary>Basic-Guide.md refers to 3DBallLearning and Model that don't exist</summary>
	<description>
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Basic-Guide.md&gt;Basic-Guide.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says 
However, under &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/TFModels&gt;3DBall/TFModels&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 I only see 3DBall.nn and 3DBallHard.nn with no 3DBallLearning.nn.
Also, this refers to a Model property under the Ball 3D Agent (Script) component, but I don't see a Model property there in the inspector.
Is the documentation out of date regarding this step?
