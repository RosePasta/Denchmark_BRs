	<summary>v0.14.0: cannot start training with a demo (for GAIL)</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
When starting the training (with v0.14.0, API-14):
mlagents-learn myconfig.yaml ...
with myconfig.yaml containing demo_path(s) for pretraining and reward_signals/gail sections,
an exception is raised:

IndexError: agent_id 0 is not present in the BatchedStepResult

I don't know how to do with this!
Note: my environment worked on previous release 0.13.1
Thanks for any hint!
D.
FYI, the full exception is as follows:

		Hope you don't mind, I edited the formatting on your comment to make the stacktrace easier to read.
Are you able to reproduce this with any of the example scenes?
We'll look into it first thing on Tuesday (Monday is a holiday for our office).

		I have exactly the same issue, it happens with both GAIL and Behavioral Cloning, though the error message differs when using Behavioral Cloning. I made a thread in the Unity forums for it.
I tested the Unity examples folder with their GAIL implementation and interestingly enough, no errors occur there.
Did you do use old recordings or did you make new ones in version 0.14.0? This might be a bug with the recordings themselves, since I recorded mine in the new version..

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chriselion&gt;@chriselion&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Xiromtz&gt;@Xiromtz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for your help and reactivity.
The same for me: this issue concerns new demo recordings with the 0.14.0 version.
(my .demo files were 0.14.0-compliant)

 / &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Xiromtz&gt;@Xiromtz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  We've confirmed that this is a bug with v0.14.0 and are working on a fix.

		Just a heads up that this should be fixed in the 0.14.1 release, which came out today. Your demonstration files from 0.14.0 will load, but you probably need to re-record them because some information wasn't captured during the initial recording.

 Thank you for the fix.
I already checked with the patch given at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3464&gt;#3464&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 on ml-agents/mlagents/trainers/demo_loader.py
that it works fine by now.
Thanks!
