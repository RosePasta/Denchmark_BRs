	<summary>Doxygen Input Path Not Updated</summary>
	<description>
The Doxygen config file still uses the Project/ filepath for scripts, even though they were recently moved to com.unity.ml-agents.
When compiling the doxygen config file, only warnings are output. Opening the index.html shows that there is no content, since it couldn't find any of the scripts.
I am using version 0.14.0 of mlagents.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Xiromtz&gt;@Xiromtz&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - thanks for calling out this issue. We just updated the doxygen config file to point to the correct directory. This is currently fixed on the  (unreleased branch) and will be pushed out in our next release. You can find the change in this PR: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3490&gt;#3490&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
