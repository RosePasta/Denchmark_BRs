	<summary>From 0.6a to 0.7</summary>
	<description>
I get the following error in the command line after upgrading to 0.7
mlagents.envs.exception.UnityEnvironmentException: The API number is not compatible between Unity and python. Python API : API-6, Unity API : API-7
I have tried to reinstall everything from scratch following the instructions &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.7.0/docs/Installation-Windows.md&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but the same thing happens.
Any help is welcome.

		Are you using a virtual environment like Conda?

		I'm running Windows and Anaconda yes. As said before, I carefully followed all the steps &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.7.0/docs/Installation-Windows.md&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Are you using a separate conda environment for each version?  I suspect that mlagents-learn command is referencing your old previous 0.6 install of ML-Agents.

		No, I removed the previous conda environment (in Anaconda) before recreating a new one (by command line following the instructions).

		It's been my experience that the anaconda gui in windows does not properly
manage command line environments.

 I just tried to remove any conda environment by command line (versus using Anaconda gui) but still getting the exact same error :/

		i got the same error after installing 0.70 using the instructions &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/ml-agents&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i.e., "sh" followed by "pip install  mlagents"
my error traceback just before the message showed that the mlagents-learn command was indeed attempting to use my 0.60a install instead of 0.70.
after doing the more familiar install using the instructions &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, i.e., "pip3 install -e ." from the internal ml-agents directory, everything is now working perfectly.
hope this helps.

		@enidn THANK YOU!
Using "pip3 install -e ." worked! I guess the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.7.0/docs/Installation-Windows.md&gt;0.7 documentation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 should mention pip3 instead (edited).
Also, for anybody upgrading from  to 0.6 to 0.7, don't forget to use ENABLE_BARRACUDA instead of ENABLE_TENSORFLOW in your Player Settings.

		That command is on the 0.7 docs page you linked, more specifically in "Step 3: Install Required Python Packages".

		pip3 versus pip
I'm not a pip expert but it seems to have made a difference in our case.

		pip3 uses Python 3.6. I am guessing you have an underlying Python 2.X version in your laptop where things were getting installed when we used pip.
