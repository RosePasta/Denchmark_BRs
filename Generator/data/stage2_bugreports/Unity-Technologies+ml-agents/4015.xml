I got training going and there is no error message on my console. I couldn't understand why the log disappeared.
My issue is resolved.

 Also hitting the same issue: .
Tried to rebuild my conda environment by removing from existing one, and then doing a fresh pip install mlagents - but still hitting the same problem.
The only other message I see that may be related, when pressing  on the Unity Environment, I see: . This seems to be another issues (raised &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/2306&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Not sure this is affecting anything here though, as I see no actual errors at runtime, but the Log described above regarding API version 1.0.0.

		For what it's worth - it seems that the  was in fact my problem. You can remove this error by following the instructions here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Cysharp/MagicOnion/issues/212&gt;Cysharp/MagicOnion#212&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I then had to restart the mlagents-learn command with a new run-id and restart the Unity environment, and after that, it's training perfectly.
