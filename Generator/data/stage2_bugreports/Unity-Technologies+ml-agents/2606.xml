	<summary>Connection reset by peer after every stop</summary>
	<description>
Using Linux Mint 19.2 cinnamon,
fresh mlagents installation via pip3 following the installation guide,
Unity 2019.2.6f1
i am able to run mlagents-learn successfully using the editor as environment, but after stopping playmode in the editor or canceling mlagents-learn in the terminal via ctrl-c, when restarting it i alway get:
ConnectionResetError: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
I have to wait about a minute every time until i can restart it without getting this error.
Do i have to accept that or is there maybe another preferred way to stop/cancel a run?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Flavelius&gt;@Flavelius&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 -- this is a known issue on Linux.  After closing the training session the OS seems to hold onto the ports used by the editor (or builds) for about a minute and not allow new connections.  Since this isn't an issue with ML-Agents but the networking I don't believe there's anything we can do to fix it.

		That's unfortunate. I've tried to find anwers to this and read that reusing the socket in question may be a way to overcome it. I think in this case the sideeffects are controlled/limited so maybe that could be worth to investigate.

		Please share if you find a good fix for this :-)
In the meantime, one suggestion I can make is to create a binary build of your game and pass to --env.  Then you can set the --base-port to change the port used on each run rather than waiting around.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Flavelius&gt;@Flavelius&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
After some research we've decided that we won't pursue fixing this bug.  If you can narrow it down further we may be able to point you to a 3rd part project we are using (gRPC for instance). A bug report may find a softer landing there.  Thank you for the report.
