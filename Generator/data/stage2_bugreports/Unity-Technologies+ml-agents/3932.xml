		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evercloud&gt;@evercloud&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I see that the editor keeps reloading a native plugin.  I'll ask with our editor and prefab teams to see if this is a known issue.  Thanks

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/evercloud&gt;@evercloud&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
It looks like you’ve unearthed a bug in the editor.  They are working on a fix.  In the mean time, we will be adding a workaround today so this doesn’t happen in the future.  Thank you for finding and taking the time to report this.  It helps ml-agents and unity become better with feedback like this.
Cheers,
Chris
