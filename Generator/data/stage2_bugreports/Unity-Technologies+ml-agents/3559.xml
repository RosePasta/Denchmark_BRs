	<summary>"failed to open source file: 'Tensor.cginc'" during (iOS) build, runs fine in Editor</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I recently updated Unity from 2019.2 to 2020.1 (need the Unity transport and netCode) and (had to) update ml-agents from 0.10 to latest. I went through the migration guide and everything is working in the editor. But when I build I get ~250 errors, all referencing Shader error for Tensor.cginc.
A few are:
Shader error in 'Activation': failed to open source file: 'Tensor.cginc' at kernel Clip_Loop at line 118 (on metal)
Shader error in 'BarracudaReferenceImpl': failed to open source file: 'Tensor.cginc' at kernel BroadcastLessEqual at line 65 (on metal)
Shader error in 'Broadcast': failed to open source file: 'Tensor.cginc' at kernel BroadcastAdd at line 18 (on metal)
Shader error in 'Dense': failed to open source file: 'Tensor.cginc' at kernel Dense_L1Cached64 at line 14 (on metal)
Shader error in 'Generic': failed to open source file: 'Tensor.cginc' at kernel Copy at line 14 (on metal)
Shader error in 'Pool': failed to open source file: 'Tensor.cginc' at kernel AvgPool2D at line 9 (on metal)

Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS + version: MacOS 10.15.2
ML-Agents version:  0.14.1+ (top of master (5cc3d76) as I needed the grpc fix 608fdcf)
TensorFlow version: 2.0.1 (I installed in a virtualenv as recommended but thought maybe the unity build was running in the default environment so I updated that to tensorflow 2.0.1 as well and still had the same error. Side note - which virtualenv does Unity build in / how do you set that?).
Environment: My own game. I'm assuming / hoping this is something simple I messed up, but if you need me to re-create on a sample environment let me know. Could it be that

NOTE: We are unable to help reproduce bugs with custom environments.  Please attempt to reproduce your issue with one of the example environments, or provide a minimal patch to one of the environments needed to reproduce the issue.

		Deleting my Library folder then re-opening the project fixed it!
