Academy.Done() doesn't work when called during agent action.
I setup my agents to synchronously call academy.Done when their action causes the game to end.
this sets the done flag, which is immediately reset during EnvironmentStep and will not reset the academy (which happens earlier in the EnvironmentStep routine)

		I think you are right, the academy needs to be set to done at the beginning of the step for it to work. I would recommend only setting the academy Done flag in the AcademyStep method of the academy.

		for now I worked around it by starting a coroutine and yielding a frame.
