	<summary>tf.argmax doesn't work in tensorflow&amp;gt;=1.3</summary>
	<description>
I got the error below in Unity Editor, Mac standalone, and Android when I run a model including tf.argmax trained in tensorflow r1.3. There is no problem with tensorflow r1.2.
I guess this error happens because the TensorFlowSharp that is used by the ML-Agents package in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Making-a-new-Unity-Environment.md&gt;this doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is outdated. I found that the 'output_type' argument is added in tensorflow r1.3 and the latest TensorFlowSharp has followed this change.
So it is helpful that you update the package or provide a guide to make a package with newer TensorFlowSharp.
the error:
TFException: NodeDef mentions attr 'output_type' not in
Op&lt;name=ArgMax; signature=input:T, dimension:Tidx -&gt; output:int64;
attr=T:type,allowed=[DT_FLOAT, DT_DOUBLE, DT_INT64, DT_INT32, DT_UINT8, DT_UINT16, DT_INT16, DT_INT8, DT_COMPLEX64, DT_COMPLEX128, DT_QINT8, DT_QUINT8, DT_QINT32, DT_HALF];
attr=Tidx:type,default=DT_INT32,allowed=[DT_INT32, DT_INT64]&gt;; NodeDef:
ArgMax = ArgMax[T=DT_FLOAT, Tidx=DT_INT32, output_type=DT_INT32](add_1, ArgMax/dimension).

		Hi @matsui-k20xx,
Thanks for pointing this out. We will update the TensorFlowSharp packages to the latest version of TF in order to ensure compatibility.

		Hi, I still have the same issue, currently using TF 1.4.1. Is there a way to get around this?

		When I tested, argmax only worked in TF &lt;= v1.2.  I think this problem is because of TensorFlowSharp version, but I don't know if it has been updated.

		It does work with Tensorflow 1.0! Thanks!
