	<summary>Inference mode for mlagents-learn causes problems with TensorBoard</summary>
	<description>
1. I am training a model. I stop the training and run mlagents-learn without --train to just benchmark the agent. It causes problems with TensorBoard where the graph jumps to the beginning of the training, see picture below.
Maybe training data should not be saved for the model if the model is run in a inference mode to not confuse Tensorboard?

2. Also I am getting .csv files in the summaries folder. These files are only created with --debug, but I am not using --debug. Why are these files are still created if I am not using the debug flag?

 case 1) is because you're running with the same .  If you pass a new run-id with the  flag you should be able to avoid adding the datapoints to the same graph.
For 2) the intention was always that these .csv files should be created whether or not you use --debug.  The goal of these files is to provide a plaintext summary (vs. the Tensorflow binary format) which you can use to monitor the performance of your training session.

		This has been fixed since release 0.14.0. Now when running inference it will continue to log from where you last started. Feel free to reopen the issue if you're still having issues. Thanks for reporting!
