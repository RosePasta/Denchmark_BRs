	<summary>cython dependency is missing from requirements.txt</summary>
	<description>
When creating a new venv and trying to install all the requirements I get the following warnings:
mkl-random 1.0.1 requires cython, which is not installed.
mkl-fft 1.0.0 requires cython, which is not installed.
The installation does proceed to completion. This might be because cython is missing from the requirements.txt file.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/avilay&gt;@avilay&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Nice to see you here. I assume the issue is related to the numpy package installation, where cython is a possible backend which seems to not be required by numpy, but required by some of the packages it installs. Thanks for brining this up.

		I remember I got the same warning when installed the environment.
Best regards.

		As far as we can tell the addition of a cython dependency isn't required for ml-agents to work correctly.  We've also eliminated requirements.txt in favor of setup.py.  If you run into any issues other than a warning please feel free to reopen, but I'm closing for now.
