	<summary>No reward showing on tensorboard when decision interval is greater than 1</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I have two behaviours in the environemnt, and whenever the decision interval is set to be &gt;1 for either of them, the reward of that one doesn't show on Tensorboard (and indeed it isn't present on the summaries folder). But when the decision interval is set to 1, it does show.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS + version: Ubuntu 18.10
ML-Agents version: develop branch at commit ebad90f. EDIT: I've tested on latest dev branch, and it seems to have the same issue
TensorFlow version: 1.14.0

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guillefix&gt;@guillefix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, this bug should have been fixed by PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3181&gt;#3181&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and it should work now in both  and the new 0.13.0 release.
FYI the develop branch has been deprecated; master contains the latest changes. You can use tags to get the official versioned releases.
