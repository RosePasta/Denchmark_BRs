Any help would be great

		There is a method someone suggested for installing with conda instead of
pip maybe try that?

		Hi all.
Looks like this is an issue recently introduced by numpy. We will take a look and try to find a solution.

		I was able to get past this by reinstalling with Conda.
conda install numpy=1.13.1
Than I got an issue with win32api missing which I was able to reinstall using pip
pip install pypiwin32
After that I was able to launch mlagents-learn one single time then it closed itself and now I just get an "unable to start process" from conda
Hope this helps someone!

		Our team fixed this issue by using a custom yaml installation file.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Salzian/80d34cd486bcdd1d125c2b9045b66349&gt;https://gist.github.com/Salzian/80d34cd486bcdd1d125c2b9045b66349&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Install it using
conda env create -f environment.yaml
Make sure to delete the existing ml-agents environment first.

		This does not seem to be a ML-Agents issue. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/1508&gt;ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues#1508&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

After all there is no solution?

you can reinstall with
conda install numpy==1.15.4
pip install pypiwin32
Mine works perfectly.
