	<summary>training crashes with some NaNs in reward, and throws "unable to save timers to file"</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
At some arbitrary point training crashes.
When checking my player.log file at the time of crashing I see that the agent rewards become NaN's, and after it prints:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Unable to save timers to file C:/Users/ZOTAC/Desktop/MLTemp/builds/9_2_1/agents2_Data\ML-Agents\Timers\Clay3D_timers.json 
(Filename: C:\buildslave\unity\build\Runtime/Export/Debug/Debug.bindings.h Line: 35)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

After this happens, I cannot train any further with --resume. It simply quits, and saves model without any errors..
Any ideas?

Unity Version: Unity 2019.4.0f1
OS + version: [e.g. Windows 10]
ML-Agents version: ml-agents release 6
Environment: custom environemnt

		Nevermind. Turns out the -default- yaml script was executed due to a typo in behavior name. This went without warnings. Maybe nice to throw an exception for this scenario in the future?
