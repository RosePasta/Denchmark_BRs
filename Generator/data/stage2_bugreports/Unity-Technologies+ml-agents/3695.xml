Steps to reproduce the behavior:

set package ML-Agent (version 0.14.1)
Set Build setting like a below screenshot.

Build

Burst requires gcc/clang toolchains to be correctly installed in order to build a standalone player for Linux with X64_SSE4
Unable to find /usr/bin/clang or /usr/bin/gcc, is the gcc/clang toolchain installed?

		Hi,
Burst cross-compilation (in your case from Windows to Linux) does not work with the version that you have installed.  This is installed through our dependency on the Barracuda package.
This inability to cross-compile is a known limitation of the Burst package at the version installed.
You can disable burst compilation from the Jobs -&gt; Burst menu to work around this issue.

I am going to close this for now as this is not an issue with ML-Agents.

		disabling compilation does not have any effect. So it is impossible to build to Linux from Windows or are there any other workarounds?

		what do you mean?  Do you still get a burst error? Or do you get another error?

		If you have Unity 2019.1+ you can &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.1/manual/index.html#standalone-player-support&gt;disable burst per platform&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in the Unity Project settings.

		I am using Unity 2019.2.5f1 and I still get burst error even when I have disabled burst.

		I have a project that I have been working on (Windows 10). Now that I have good results, I want to scale it and perform multiple runs on a high performance computer remotely i.e a Linux system, So I need to cross-build. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

,
Could you try to open up the Project settings by going to the menu -&gt; Edit -&gt; Project Settings... and disable burst for linux from there?

I'm reaching out to the Burst team now.  I'll get back to you when I get a response.

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AsadJeewa&gt;@AsadJeewa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
According to the Burst team, this is a knew issue with Burst 1.1.  We just updated barracuda on our master branch which updates the Burst dependency.  This will allow you to disable it and not see the compile errors.  You can try it out now by checking out our master branch and trying to build for Linux with Burst disabled.  Unfortunately, the fix for cross-compilation with Burst won't be available until they release the 1.3 version of their package.
You could also install the 0.6.3-preview Barracuda package into your project until you update ml-agents after the next release to get the Burst plugin update.
Let me know if you run into any issues with these workarounds.

		Thank you very much. I upgraded and it successfully builds when I disable Burst.

		This issue is fixed in master since we are on barracuda 0.6.3.  I will close this now and please reopen if the issue persists.
