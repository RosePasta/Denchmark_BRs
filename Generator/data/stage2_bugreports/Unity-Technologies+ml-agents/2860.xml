	<summary>Cannot GetValueEstimate when in Inference mode</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
This is something that worked in Version .8 but not in version .10. If I call GetValueEstimate on a trained brain in inference mode, the returned value is always 0.
To Reproduce
Train a brain using PPO
Switch the Academy "control" setting for the brain to unchecked
Try to call "GetValueEstimate()" in AgentAction. The value will be zero.
I have been looking through the code in "LearningBrain.cs" which is responsible for retreiving the action value. When I print out the m_OutputNames from the tensor model after it is loaded the output names are:

action
value_estimate

However if I try to fetch the Tensor for "value_estimate" in FetchBarracudaOutputs
var output = m_Engine.Peek("value_estimate");
Then a "KeyNotFound" Exception is thrown.

Environment (please complete the following information):

Windows 10
ML-Agents version: (e.g. ML-Agents v0.10)
TensorFlow version: 1.7
Environment: 3DBallHard

I added GetValueEstimate() at the beginning of AgentAction. It always returns 0 if the brain is in inference mode.
If I try to add "value_estimate" to the outputs in BarracudaModelParams.GetOutputNames, then a "KeyNotFound" Exception is thrown.
In Version .8 this worked. I could get the value estimate when in inference mode. This is very useful.

 could you please update to the latest version (ml-agents 0.11) and try this again?

		Yes it happens with version 0.11 too.
To reproduce
Clean install of ML-Agents v 0.11
Open the 3DBallHard.Unity scene
Edit the Ball3DHardAgent.cs so that at the beginning of AgentAction
Debug.Log("Value= " + GetValueEstimate());
Run the scene in inference mode. The console will print "Value= 0"

 apologies for the delay in replying. this feature has been removed from our code base and there is no equivalent of this anymore. I recommend upgrading to the latest version of ML-Agents as we have introduced several new features and many bugs have been fixed.
