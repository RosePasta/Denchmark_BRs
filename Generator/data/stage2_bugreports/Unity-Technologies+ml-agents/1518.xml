	<description>
I migrated to 0.6v but i get a lot of errors (1245) in VisualStudio. I tried to run all the trubleshooting that i did with the 0.5v but it doesnt help at all. The most frequent error is the CS0229.

		I haven't reported this issue but I reported &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/1511&gt;#1511&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I don't think they are related. Errors look differently. But I'm not an expert :)
