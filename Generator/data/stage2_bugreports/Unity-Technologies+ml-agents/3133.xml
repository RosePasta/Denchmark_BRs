	<summary>BUG?  gym wrapper's step() returns "BatchedStepResult" instead of "dict" for the fourth param.</summary>
	<description>
the 4th. return parameter ("info") for function step() should be "dict";
however in a recent update (2019 dec 10) it was changed into "BatchedStepResult".
which at least caused troubles when training with baseline,
e.g.:
File "/xxx/stable-baselines/stable_baselines/td3/td3.py", line 343, in learn
maybe_ep_info = info.get('episode')
AttributeError: 'BatchedStepResult' object has no attribute 'get'

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/weiziqian&gt;@weiziqian&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - this does look like a bug. I've logged it as MLA-486 in our internal tracker, and we should have a fix for it soon.

		I believe &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3136&gt;#3136&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 will fix this, but I want to run it by some other folks that are more familiar with the gym interface.

		I also logged a longer-term issue for us to add better testing around this; we have a few unit tests but no integration tests that run training with the gym wrapper.
