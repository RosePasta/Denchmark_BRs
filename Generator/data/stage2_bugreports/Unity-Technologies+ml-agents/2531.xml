	<summary>Unity c# script compile issues when creating Custom Protobuf</summary>
	<description>
After I run make.bat the generated files in my unity project throw errors
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2358507/64670893-81e53b00-d41b-11e9-9411-462cf78db0be.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To reproduce I restore my project to what is on the repo
git reset --hard
then I go to /protobuf-definitions and call make.bat
I go to ml-agents and ml-agents-env and call pip install -e .
calling mlagents-learn shows the unity logo
returning to Unity shows many errors.

OS + version: macOS latest
ML-Agents version: latest

Am I supposed to add some python code here? This step was confusing for me, is it just info?

		Here are the newly generated .proto files which are throwing errors

		Did you    ?
I have &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/2503&gt;a problem&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 with the Custom Protobuf, yet at least I get it to compile.

		Yeah I have done that after resetting my repo and I have the same results. Maybe we have to add something to the python instance?

		Well, perhaps what you say makes sense. You know where it says &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Creating-Custom-Protobuf-Messages.md&gt;The Python instance of the custom action looks like:&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


Are we supposed to create this python instance or do we expect it to be generated automatically with the other files? I cannot seem to find it anywhere using grep
Edit*
Sorry, for your issue this should not be causing the problem (e.g. the python instance). I am able to go a step further than you (up to building the game) without having to deal with this instance
Do you get any errors when you Run the .bat from the terminal?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yakmyakmyakm&gt;@yakmyakmyakm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you try building the protobuf definitions without changing anything related to the custom observation or action?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awjuliani&gt;@awjuliani&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Ok. I have now tried with an empty custom action and observation and I get the same result. Maybe this is a version issue?

		It seems there is indeed something wrong with your build process. As &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TSTsankov&gt;@TSTsankov&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 asked, what is your output in the terminal from running the  ?

Here is my output from running ./make.bat

		Hi, we just merged some protobuf generation changes to develop if youâ€™d like to give it a try.  Do you have a local version of protoc installed?  If so, what version?  I tried regenerating the protobufs myself and ran into compile issues because my local protoc was version 3.9.1 while the NuGet package one was 3.51.  Maybe something similar is happening to you?

		Hi All,
We have deprecated the custom protobuf feature in favor of a new method of communication between Unity and Python called side channels. You can read more about them here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Custom-SideChannels.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Custom-SideChannels.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The main benefit is that building custom protobuf objects is no longer necessary, which should provide faster turnaround time during experimentation.
Feel free to open a new issue if there are any issues or suggestions related to the new side channels.
