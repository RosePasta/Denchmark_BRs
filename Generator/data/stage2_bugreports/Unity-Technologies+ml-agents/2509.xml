		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/MarkTension&gt;@MarkTension&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It looks like some of the Player settings have changed since that part of the documentation was written (That settings appears in the 2019.1 documentation &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html&gt;https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.1/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but was apparently removed in 2019.2). You should be fine ignoring that setting for now; we'll update the documentation to be clearer.

		I've added a request to update the documentation around this to our internal tracker with the ID MLA-18. I’m going to close this issue for now, but we’ll ping back with any updates
