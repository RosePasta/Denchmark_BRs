	<summary>v.0.14.0 .demo files showing incorrect number of episodes / mean reward</summary>
	<description>
I'm trying to record a demonstration file for the Basic example scene to work with BC/Gail training.  The resulting .demo file shows a correct number of experiences, but incorrect number of episodes and incorrect mean reward.  Over the course of my demonstration, the agent script called Done() 65 times, and reset correctly in the Game window, which is not reflected in the demonstration.  See screenshot below:

Maybe this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/3205&gt;#3205&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS + version: Mac OS 10.13.6
ML-Agents version: v.0.14.0

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/AidanNelson&gt;@AidanNelson&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 -- yes, this issue seems to be related to the other issues we're having with demo files in 0.14.0.  We're working on a fix for this and will update when this is fixed.
