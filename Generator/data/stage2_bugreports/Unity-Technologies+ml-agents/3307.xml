	<summary>Learning-Environment-Create-New.md refers to materials that don't exist: LightGridFloorSquare, Block, CheckerSquare</summary>
	<description>

At various points in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md&gt;Learning-Environment-Create-New.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 it says to use materials that I wasn't able to find: LightGridFloorSquare, Block, and CheckerSquare.
Perhaps materials have changed names and the intended materials are LightGridFloor, GoalLit, and Checkers_Ball? However, in the latest master branch, the instructions say to use the ml-agents package and it looks like none of those Examples materials would be available.

 If you look under Assets in the Unity Project panel you will find these materials there. They might be under a modified name. In case the materials are not there could you please submit a PR with the updated documentation?

: I was thinking of updating the names, but then I noticed that in the latest master branch Learning-Environment-Create-New.md says to use the com.unity.ml-agents inside a new Unity project. When I tried this, none of the example materials were pulled into my project. So I'm not sure how this should work.
Did something go wrong on my end when I was testing this? Should examples be included with com.unity.ml-agents? Or should there be a separate examples package? Or should Learning-Environment-Create-New.md be modified to avoid using examples content?

 we decided to not include examples in the package. you can find the examples in the Project folder in the repo. closing the issue for no.  feel free to reopen it, if needed.

		This answers my question and I can work around it.
Do you intend to leave the documentation as-is? It seems like that is confusing for users trying to follow these instructions.
