using the version of ml-agents current as of today (can't find any version number) and the recommended ami ami-016ff5559334f8619
trying to remove + rebuild ml-agents results in an error because pip is python3.5 on the image, but this requires 3.6

		I also tried with "Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 22.0 (ami-060865e8b5914b4c4)" as recommended in the "install yourself" route, and got the same problems

		As the error suggests, it's because the VM is using python 3.5.2 and not 3.6. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xiaomaogy&gt;@xiaomaogy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, do you know if it's always been like that, or if it's a recent change to the VM? AFAIK we've not supported Python 3.5.2 for a while.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/increpare&gt;@increpare&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, if you want to live a bit on the dangerous side, you can modify the setup.py in ml-agents and remove this line . It should install and run, though no guarantees that everything works.

		(FWIW I 'solved' my problem eventually in a screen session by copypaste-ing
a jumble of random upgrade/environment commands from online to get
everything to 3.6 - nothing I can easily reconstruct to post here though)

 @increpare &lt;https://github.com/increpare&gt;, if you want to live a bit on
 the dangerous side, you can modify the setup.py in ml-agents and remove
 this line python_requires="&gt;=3.6,&lt;3.7". It should install and run, though
 no guarantees that everything works.

 I remember on the instance there is a list of python environment you could pick from, and it is very easy to choose python 3.6 without a jumble of random upgrade commands.  However I haven't used the ami for a while, so not sure what happens to it now.
