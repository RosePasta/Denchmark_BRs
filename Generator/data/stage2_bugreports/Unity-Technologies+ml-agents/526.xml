	<summary>NavMeshAgent does not work</summary>
	<description>
Hello
I am using a NavMeshAgent component in my environment, making a character to move to a target destination. Using the player brain, it works in Unity and it works also when I export it to Windows and Linux.
However, when I run the environment using python (in an Ubuntu instance), the character does not move. There is no error in the log file. The training can run, but the character does not move.
Any idea?
Thanks

		Just tested in Windows using python, same results :(

		I was using CharacterController.Move to move the character. A workaround is to modify directly the transform.position

		It looks like the NavMeshAgent is updating periodically only every ~100 steps.

		I am using NavMeshAgent but moving my character manually.  I call SetDestination and then using nextPosition and steeringTarget to navigate.

 Do you see any error message when you tested it in the Windows platform? More information would be helpful here.

 I'm not really familiar with NavMeshAgent, and so not able to reproduce what bug you have here. Maybe it would be helpful if you can share the steps and the source code you have, so that we can reproduce the bug you have.
