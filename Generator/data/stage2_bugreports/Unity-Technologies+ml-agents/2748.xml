	<summary>Dragging unity from 1 screen to another with different DPI causes training to crash</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When I have 2 monitors connected to my laptop and drag unity from my 200% DPI screen to my 100% DPI screen Unity takes a while to resize and then shows an exception. The agents also stop moving after this.
To Reproduce

Start training on one of the scenes using for example:
mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --run-id=hide_8 --train
Once training, drag Unity to your other DPI screen
Watch the Errors

I spoke with our engine team and it seems like this might be a bug in the editor.  It's causing a script reload when you drag between windows with different DPIs at the moment, which seems like a bit of overkill.  This pull request will indeed fix the errors from showing up in the console, but your entire scene is being reloaded when you drag between those different DPI screens.  In other words, if you are in play mode on windows, don't drag the editor between screens if you don't want to reload your entire scene.
I am filing a bug against the editor internally and will post back here when it is fixed.

There has been an issue filed against Unity with the ID 1193597.  I am going to close this for now, and I'll update it when the fix goes into a Unity release.  Until then, feel free to open another issue if you run into trouble.
Cheers,
Chris and the ML-Agents Team

		Hi, the fix for this will be in the 2019.3 release of unity.  It looks like it may be in 2019.3.0.b10 release if you are following the beta releases.
