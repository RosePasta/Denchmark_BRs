	<summary>CTL+C not exiting cleanly and saving training</summary>
	<description>
I am a total python newb so that might be a factor but I'm happily training agents using Python 3.6.4 through an Anaconda Prompt and they're working fine.
Now I'm trying to use imitation learning and need to sometimes terminate the training early, instead of letting it run its course.
This is the error I get:
forrtl: error (200): program aborting due to control-C event

Control + BREAK does the same.....

,
Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Unfortunately functionality across different Windows  versions and set-ups are not consistent. Can you tell us a little more about your Windows version?

		This bug has been fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/1558&gt;#1558&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The error message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;forrtl: error (200): program aborting due to control-C event
Image PC Routine Line Source
libifcoremd.dll 00007FFDAFF994C4 Unknown Unknown Unknown
KERNELBASE.dll 00007FFDEF127EDD Unknown Unknown Unknown
KERNEL32.DLL 00007FFDF2131FE4 Unknown Unknown Unknown
ntdll.dll 00007FFDF226EFC1 Unknown Unknown Unknown
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

still exist, which is related to this stackoverflow &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42653389/ctrl-c-causes-forrtl-error-200-rather-than-python-keyboardinterrupt-exception&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42653389/ctrl-c-causes-forrtl-error-200-rather-than-python-keyboardinterrupt-exception&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Our fix get around this error by adding another ctrl-c event handler which saves the model before this error.
