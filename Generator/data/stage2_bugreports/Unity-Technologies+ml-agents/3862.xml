	<summary>15.0 and 15.1 won't show "Start training by pressing the play button in the Unity Editor" in console when initialising training</summary>

Describe the bug
When I initialize training with "mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --run-id=wall-jump-curriculum --train" for example, the console window is showing the usual unity logo and in version 14.1 the last lines say: "Start training by pressing the play button in the Unity Editor", unfortunately, that does not happen anymore in 15.0 or 15.1, the last lines show "Instructions for updating: non-resource variables are not supported in the long term", after that I hit play in the Unity Editor, and it works fine (training). Now I'm wondering, is this a known bug or did I set up incorrectly? Others reported similar issues. Thank you!
