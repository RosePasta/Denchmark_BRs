	<summary>Unity crashed while running mlagents-learn</summary>
	<description>
I was following the instruction of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.15.1/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md&gt;Learning-Environment-Create-New&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
While I using the command mlagents-learn config/config.yaml --run-id=RollarBall-1, the window of Unity was closed, which happened a lot of times.
The step should reach 30000 which was set in the config/config.yaml, however, the program quit at the step of 10000.
Plus, the folder models/RollarBall-1 is empty.

Hello @canyon
Can you share what version of Unity you are running?

Sorry, I forgot. It's Unity 2018.4.19f1 and Ml-agents 0.15.1.

		Thanks for sharing these versions. Have you been able to make it all the way through this guide without Unity crashing: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Yes, I followed the instructions exactly.
But now, after I clean up background programs in my computer, the problem was solved.
I did some tests, and I think that is the reason causes Unity to crash on my computer.
My CPU model is Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6300U CPU @ 2.40GHZ and memory capacity is 8 GB.
Thank you for your help!
