	<summary>Ctrl-C not saving/exporting at end of training</summary>
	<description>
As the title says.
After some digging, I saw that KeyboardInterrupt exception was not being called, instead giving the following error:

forrtl: error (200): program aborting due to control-C event
Image              PC                Routine            Line        Source

ntdll.dll          00007FFB9B0C54E4  Unknown               Unknown  Unknown

I have altered the trainer_controller.py to save and export every few thousand steps, as a way to bypass this issue. But I'm wondering if it's just me, and why am I facing this issue.
Thanks

		This seems related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/543&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 issue. I am assuming you are on Windows and you have loaded the latest master.

		I am indeed using the latest from master. I think this may be a different issue as the error I got is different from the one at that link, and since I am getting this when it should already have been fixed.

		HINT IF AFRAID OF LOOSING MODEL AFTER HOURS OF TRAINING BY PRESSING CTRL-C
We had the same issue, and thought our model is lost, but refering to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/532&gt;@Hengoo answer&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 you can load the model and continue training at a given point in time, and then exit the training in Unity by pressing the Play-Button, so your model get's saved. Worked for us and we could save our model of 20+ hours of training! ;)

		This bug has been fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/1558&gt;#1558&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The error message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;forrtl: error (200): program aborting due to control-C event
Image PC Routine Line Source
libifcoremd.dll 00007FFDAFF994C4 Unknown Unknown Unknown

KERNEL32.DLL 00007FFDF2131FE4 Unknown Unknown Unknown
ntdll.dll 00007FFDF226EFC1 Unknown Unknown Unknown
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

still exist, which is related to this stackoverflow &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42653389/ctrl-c-causes-forrtl-error-200-rather-than-python-keyboardinterrupt-exception&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42653389/ctrl-c-causes-forrtl-error-200-rather-than-python-keyboardinterrupt-exception&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Our fix get around this error by adding another ctrl-c event handler which saves the model before this error.
