	<summary>gym-unity cannot connect to Unity Editor because DEFAULT_EDITOR_PORT is not defined.</summary>
	<description>
When trying to use the gym-unity library to communicate with an open Unity Editor rather than a pre-built Unity binary, I am receiving an attribute error because gym-unity.envs.UnityEnv is attempting to use UnityEnvironment.DEFAULT_EDITOR_PORT but this is never defined anywhere, and is only referenced on this one line.
To Reproduce
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sys

from gym_unity.envs import UnityEnv

%matplotlib inline

print("Python version:")
print(sys.version)

if (sys.version_info[0] &lt; 3):
    raise Exception("ERROR: ML-Agents Toolkit (v0.3 onwards) requires Python 3")

multi_env_name = None 
multi_env = UnityEnv(multi_env_name, worker_id=0, 
                     use_visual=False, multiagent=True)

# Examine environment parameters
print(str(multi_env))
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment:

Ubuntu 18.04
ML-Agents 0.14.0 and ML-Agents 0.14.1
This occurs while attempting to load the environment

FWIW, I have replaced the call to UnityEnvironment.DEFAULT_EDITOR_PORT locally with the actual value (5004) and it seems to work fine afterwards.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xXZetserXx&gt;@xXZetserXx&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Does this only happen on Ubuntu? I tried on mac and it seems to use 5004 by default.

 I don't currently have Unity and ML-Agents setup on another operating system, but I do know of other people who have used the library (although not necessarily the gym-unity portion) on Windows without issue. Is it possible that I need some OS level environment variable needs to be set or something like that?

 Just realized that you are trying to connect to a Unity Editor on Ubuntu OS. Is this Unity Editor running under Ubuntu or Windows, and how do you ensure the port gets forwarded?

		Looks like this issue has been idle for a while. You're right that the usage of  was added in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.14.0/gym-unity/gym_unity/envs/__init__.py#L62&gt;0.14.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, but that appears to be before it was added in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.15.0/ml-agents-envs/mlagents_envs/environment.py#L66&gt;0.15.0&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I'm not exactly sure how that happened (maybe a bad merge or cherry-pick) but everything should be OK now, so I'm going to close this issue.
