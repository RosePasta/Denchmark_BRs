	<summary>Gym examples don't work with TF2.0</summary>
	<description>
I may have overlooked something, but when installing ml-agents with pip, it automatically installs TF2.0. But the examples on this page don't work with that version: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/gym-unity/README.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/gym-unity/README.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

OpenAI baselines doesn't seem to be updated to 2.0 - same with Dopamine. So the examples just don't work if you install ml-agents normally.

What is the suggested course of action? Should I downgrade to 1.15? Seems a bit counterproductive.
Are you planning on updating this? Right now there's no gym example in your doc that actually works with the default installation.

		Hi,
gym_unity and mlagents_envs do not have dependencies on TensorFlow. Only mlagents (the trainers) have a dependency on TensorFlow. If you want to run Baselines or Dopamine, you do not need to mlagents package and I recommend making a new virtual environment without mlagents (and only gym_unity) to help you manage the dependencies.
I think if you want to use Baselines or Dopamine, you should use the versions of TensorFlow these frameworks need (meaning downgrading).

		Okay, thank you. You might want to add an annotation to your documentation though. Since those examples just don't work if you install ml-agents in the recommended way.
So do you have any suggestions on a library that does work with TF2.0? I don't intend to downgrade, as I think this newer version is leagues above the one we had before. I was thinking about trying TF-Agents, but maybe you have some other suggestion.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/DVonk&gt;@DVonk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vincentpierre&gt;@vincentpierre&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
I think  the Experimental Stable Baselines (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines-tf2&gt;https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines-tf2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) is consistent for Tf 2 version.  The Baselines are not yet migrated to Tf 2 version and I use the experimental version to run the baseline algorithms. There is an alternate repository by  Tan Zhenyu (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tanzhenyu&gt;https://github.com/tanzhenyu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) for baselines on Tf 2 , on mostly A2c and its improvisations (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tanzhenyu/baselines-tf2&gt;https://github.com/tanzhenyu/baselines-tf2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). Hope this helps
Thanks
