	<summary>BroadcastHub brain list resets upon build</summary>
	<description>
When building or running custom scenes in the editor, the brain list in Academy.BroadcastHub seems to reset in some situations (Unity version 2018.3.7f1 on linux). Current reproduction steps: add one LearningBrain and one HeuristicBrain to the BroadcastHub as well as check the control checkbox for the former. When pressing play or building, the list reverts to containing only the LearningBrain and the control checkbox becomes unchecked.
Is this an expected fallback for any faulty script present in the MLAgents stack? There are no console exceptions and the Editor.log does not give any clues.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/joabim&gt;@joabim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for bringing this up. In our own tests we haven't run into this issue, but we will try to investigate it, as it definitely sounds like some kind of bug.

		I am unable to reproduce this bug. Maybe someone from the community can confirm if this is a consistent issue. I am wondering if this is because you are trying to edit the Hub while in Play Mode (Upon exiting Play Mode, all inspector properties are reset to what they were before entering Play Mode). Can you try to look at the debug inspector when adding brains to the hub ? (In the top left corner of the inspector next to the lock select debug instead of normal)

 I see your concern but I am not altering the Hub through the inspector whilst in play mode. The reason I noticed the issue was that  indicated that no external brains were available on the python side even though at least one of them should have been a controllable LearningBrain. Interesting - when using the inspector in debug mode, the changes actually saved between builds. I still feel like something may be awry with my current Unity setup, but until I can provide more useful information this issue can be closed. It feels like it may be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/1712&gt;#1712&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - the solution didn't work for me though.
E: After further investigation it actually seems like I only can modify the BroadcastHub if I am in the inspector debug mode. When switching back to normal, none of the changes carry over between scene starts/builds.
E2: Aha, I didn't notice that other inspector changes doesn't save either - I was too used to them saving to see it. It looks like I have a problem with the Unity editor itself and not MLAgents. Closing this issue.
