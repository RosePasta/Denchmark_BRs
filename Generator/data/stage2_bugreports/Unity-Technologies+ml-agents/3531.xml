	<summary>Multiagent Bug in Gym-Unity 14.1</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
There seems to be a bug with multiagent environments in gym-unity release 14.1.
Some of the example environments work fine (e.g. 3D ball) while some of them (e.g. WallJump) fail with this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;"The environment does not have the expected amount of agents. "
gym_unity.envs.UnityGymException: The environment does not have the expected amount of agents. Some agents did not request decisions at the same time.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It is possible that the issue is originated in the Unity environment side, but I can't seem to find the reason behind it. Single Agent environments work fine.
I'm using the provided notebooks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/latest_release/notebooks/getting-started-gym.ipynb&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
Thanks,
Sahand

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sahandrez&gt;@sahandrez&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the multi-agent gym currently doesn't support environments with multiple types of behaviors (WallJump has two), or on-demand decisions (e.g. Bouncer). This is due to how gym expects all data per step to be from the same observation/action space.

,
I see. Thanks. I'm having another problem after fixing what you mentioned. Now in our custom environment, we are getting this error as soon as an agent is done in the environment:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "\workspace\ml-agents\gym-unity\gym_unity\envs\__init__.py", line 531, in mark_agent_done
    gym_index = self._agent_id_to_gym_index.pop(agent_id)
KeyError: 7
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Any idea what might have caused it? Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/sahandrez&gt;@sahandrez&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, are the agents done at different times/do they use on demand decisions?
Could you post the Inspector for your agents? Would be really helpful for us to debug. Thanks!

,
Thanks. We solved our problem. There was a bug in our environment which was not flagged in V0.13 but with the new multiagent system in V0.14 we figured it out.

 ,
Did you fix it? I got the same error when I use gym-unity-0.15.0. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you.

		Unfortunately no. But I have something that is good enough.
In my case, I believe it happened when my agent got out of bounds and didn't reset properly. It was going out of bound because my implementation was acting weird when I push the simulation speed very high.
Currently, it happens only every 10-100 episodes, so when it does I just catch it and... pass.

		For this error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;File "\workspace\ml-agents\gym-unity\gym_unity\envs\__init__.py", line 531, in mark_agent_done
    gym_index = self._agent_id_to_gym_index.pop(agent_id)
KeyError: 7
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We found a bug in the gym wrapper which would appear if an Agent called EndEpisode multiple times in the same step. The fix for this is in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3700&gt;#3700&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and we'll be doing a patch release next week that contains this fix (and a few others).
