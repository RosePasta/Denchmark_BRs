		"../envs" is just an example path, where you should replace it with your own path. When you see something "inside" or &lt;inside&gt; it means you should replace it with your own values ​​and remove the "" or &lt;&gt;.
 
It makes no sense to ship binaries (for the examples) when you provide the entire unity project itself, if not, one would need to provide binaries for different OS'es.
If you want to test any example scenes you can use the training command without --env and it will ask you to press "Play" in the editor or build any of the examples yourself and setup the --env according.

		hi, as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/caioc2&gt;@caioc2&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 mentioned, we do not ship the Unity project binaries as part of the repo.  However, you can go to File -&gt; Build Settings in Unity to build our example projects to the platform you are trying to run on (in this case, it should be MacOS).  Attaching a screenshot for you.  Let me know if this addresses your issue.
