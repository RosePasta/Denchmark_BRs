		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/adrienrenaud&gt;@adrienrenaud&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, thanks for the note. The correct ami is ami-18642967. We've changed the ami along with the ML-Agents v0.4 release, but the ami id change is still in the hotfix-0 branch that is to be merged.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/m4Ssa&gt;@m4Ssa&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - the AMI did not change. Are you checking in the us-east-1 region?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/mmattar&gt;@mmattar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
since im waiting for an aws account for my coropration I can only use the &lt;denchmark-link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;searchTerms=ami-6880c317&amp;page=1&amp;ref_=nav_search_box/&gt;marketplace&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 as a reference and I can't find it there. Other ami-id's work fine.

 I just checked and you can find it in the Community amis, which is different from the marketplace.
