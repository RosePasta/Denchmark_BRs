	<summary>Possible problem with window instructions for "Learning-Environment-Executable.md"</summary>
	<description>
Please refer to: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Executable.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Executable.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

"6. Click Build:

In the File dialog, navigate to your ML-Agents directory.
Assign a file name and click Save.
(For Windowsï¼‰With Unity 2018.1, it will ask you to select a folder instead of a file name. Create a subfolder within the ML-Agents folder and select that folder to build. In the following steps you will refer to this subfolder's name as env_name."

After following the instructions in bold, I received the following error: "UnityEditor.BuildPlayerWindow+BuildMethodException: Building to the Assets folder is not allowed."
I tested creating the sub folder in the UnitySDK directory instead and it worked without a hitch.
All the best,
Parker
