	<description>
Describe the bug

Load the 3DBall scene
Make sure the models are set on the agents
Hit 'Play' -&gt; the editor freezes

Even tho the editor freeze (beachball, force quit, etc) it doesn't use CPU resources. It might be waiting for something instead.
Console logs / stack traces

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Platform modules already initialized, skipping
LightmapEditorSettings: switching bake backend from 1 to 0.
Refreshing native plugins compatible for Editor in 0.75 ms, found 2 plugins.

		The first step in discovering the cause of the problem was realizing that 'ping localhost' didn't work on my machine. Adding the line '127.0.0.1 localhost' to the /etc/hosts file solved the ping issue and in turn solved the freeze.
Somewhere in the RpcCommunicator there must have been socket call to localhost that was not reporting errors correctly. I'm not sure if I should mark this is solved or not...

		Sorry, I meet this on 2017.4 when press 'Play' to stop,
the Unity window freezed even if I force quit in 'Force Quit Applications',
and my hosts contains '127.0.0.1 localhost'
