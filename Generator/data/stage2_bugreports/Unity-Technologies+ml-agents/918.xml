	<summary>Editor crashes every time I try to play using an Internal brain type</summary>
	<description>
I just installed the newest ml-agents beta following the newest installation guides today, 06/25/2018. I had v0.2 beta working fine on another machine, so I know roughly how it's supposed to behave. What I am experiencing now is that all example scenes work fine on Player type brain and Heuristic type brain, but any time I set it to Internal type brain and use the provided bytes file for each example, the Unity Editor crashes upon pressing Play. I am new to crashes, so I'm not sure how to troubleshoot. I've attached the Editor log but I don't know how to read it for relevant information. I'm using Unity 2018.1.2f1

 Did you follow the new documentation guide? Do you have the new TensorflowSharp plugin? Have you installed the new python packages?
Also can you list out your detailed steps that leads to a crash?

Followed this repo's &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md&gt;installation guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation-Windows.md&gt;choosing to use Anaconda&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and after that followed the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Basic-Guide.md&gt;basic guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and setup the project as it was instructed.

		I don't remember trying py before and I'm not sure what you mean by stuck, a few seconds after pressing play the editor will crash. &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/Setmaster/bfbb84d9287ba14d262d3f4dc4a1025b&gt;Here is a list of installed packages&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yes I followed the newest guide. Yes I had the tensorsharp plug-in
imported. yes I had all proper versions of packages as listed in the
documentation requirements file, and I tried multiple versions of
tensorflow, all cpu versions, and I tried with anaconda as well as without.
I think my processor must not be compatible with tensorflow. Intel core 2
extreme.

But that being said, does Python and tensorflow actually need to be
installed on the machine just to run already-trained models from bytes
files?

 No it doesn't require the python and tensorflow to be installed. But we haven't tested on the cpu you have.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Setmaster&gt;@Setmaster&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 This is something I've never seen, I've tested our repo with the Windows 10 with Unity 2018.1, and the Internal Brain works without any crash.
Can you guys build the Unity executable with the Internal Brain checked, then run the built executable in the command line and see what happens? Without any error message I am not able to even guess what's going on wrong here.....

 By executable do you mean player? About the cmd, what parameter would be used for this? Also, I built a player with the brain set to internal anyway, and it crashed when executed. &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Aq_2rUi9_dvc9-VCWYzLKN9g2GgIF-WF/view?usp=sharing&gt;Here is a copy of the player if it's useful.&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		For reference, the GPU in my Intel Core 2 Extreme PC (which crashes upon using internal brain) has an AMD Radeon HD 5800. Again, a much older computer, but it should be able to run an internal brain regardless of whether it supports all the tensorflow stuff to train new brains.

		I would be happy to test run builds, though, if that's helpful, since
presumably the crash would happen on this machine even running someone
else's game/program if it uses internal brain. I just don't have Python
installed at all anymore and don't have time/plans to install it again here.

		@Livenvh How did you test it? It seems that some of your c# script has been changed. Are you sure all of your .cs scripts inside Assets/ML-Agents folder are in sync with the v0.4 master, and only the TensorFlowSharp plugin has been switched to the older version?

		It seems that Unity 2018.2 doesn't trust TensorFlowSharp.Android.dll so it's unloaded when the Unity Platform target is set to Android. And with that .dll unloaded, the projects won't run in the Editor when the platform target is Android. They run fine on an Android device or in the Editor when the platform target is set to anything else than Android. (e.g. Windows)
When the project is loaded with TFSharp installed:

		Same issue for me too with all examples scenes provided with the toolkit ( v0.4b ).
Training (external) work just fine but if I want to check the result in internal mode , Unity just close after few seconds. It's crash with my bytes files but with the bytes files provided with the toolkit too. I delete and restart the project from scratch many times. Trying the master branch or the last release ( v0.4b ).
Because I thinking it's not directly related to my tensorflow installation and my trained bytes files , I give it a try with the TensorFlowSharp v0.3 instead of v0.4. Now it's working but not with all samples scenes. Only with one don't having "Discrete" visualisation or action vector space type. " Continuous" type work . Discrete one give me error ( ex: GridWorld scene for this error log ):

 The error message you posted is saying the bytes file you generated is using a different tensorflow version than you place you are using it. If you want to try ml-agents v0.3, then you might want to switch all of them (including the tensorflowSharp plugin to v0.3, the tensorflow version to 1.4).

 The problem you mentioned is a different issue, the TensorFlow.Android.dll file is showing the error message, but it is not the cause for the crash.

 So if you want to try ml-agents v0.3, switch all of them to v0.3, the communicator parameter error might be due to the protobuf file not compatible.

 This is not something we can solve right now due to the reason I mentioned earlier. In v0.6 (which will be released in a few weeks)we will change the way internal brain works (It will be a scriptable object instead of a gameobject, and it will be called Learning Brain). If you guys want to try you can check this PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/1250&gt;#1250&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		same here.
Windows 10 Pro 64 bit, AMD Phenom(tm) || x4 965, Unity 2018.2.10f1
Training works fine, also in the editor. But if i click on play, with an internal brain, unity instantly closes.

		Same, internal brains not working, on play unity closes instantly, while training works without a problem.
Specs:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Build 17763)
Intel Pentium G4620
Unity 2018.2.13f1

@xiaomaogy
When i try to use the older TFSharp version im getting an error in Unity:
Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/RpcCommunicator.cs(23,9): error CS0246: The type or namespace name CommunicatorParameters' could not be found. Are you missing an assembly reference?
I've build my Tensorflow without Grpc support since it didnt work with Grpc enabled. Don't know if thats a related problem though.

Hello, the same issue, did you solve it, how?

 Hi guys, i think i found solve of the issue. I clone repository into new clear diretory, done all things by instruction of v0.5, but imported TensorFlowSharp for ml-agents v0.3 from here &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TimothyA86/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md&gt;https://github.com/TimothyA86/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
My laptop has AMD A8-3520m processor, which without AVX support. Build of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Setmaster&gt;@Setmaster&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 doesn`t works.

My CPU doesn't support AVX too, I will need to try you way.

Hello, my i7 920 doesn't support AVX, I tried kudyk solution (ml_agent v0.5 / TensorFlowSharp from v0.3 ml_agent) et it seems to work!
I just tried 3Dball scene with internal brain and Unity didn't crash.
I didn't make more tests, waiting for official news about the viability of this solution.

		kudyk solution works, but most examples throws long exceptions, one of them:
TFException: NodeDef mentions attr 'output_dtype' not in Op&lt;name=Multinomial; signature=logits:T, num_samples:int32 -&gt; output:int64; attr=seed:int,default=0; attr=seed2:int,default=0; attr=T:type,allowed=[DT_FLOAT, DT_DOUBLE, DT_INT32, DT_INT64, DT_UINT8, DT_INT16, DT_INT8, DT_UINT16, DT_HALF]; is_stateful=true&gt;; NodeDef: multinomial_3/Multinomial = Multinomial[T=DT_FLOAT, output_dtype=DT_INT64, seed=670408, seed2=108](dense_3/MatMul, multinomial_3/Multinomial/num_samples). (Check whether your GraphDef-interpreting binary is up to date with your GraphDef-generating binary.).
Working examples: 3D Ball, Bouncer, Crawler, Reacher, Tennis and Walker.

		Hi everyone, v0.7 works with tensorflow 1.7.0 from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fo40225/tensorflow-windows-wheel/tree/master/1.7.0/py36/CPU/sse2&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Does it meen that tensorflow 1.7.0 now worsk with non AVX CPUs (and we don't need to use 1.4.0 any more)
or that v0.7 doesn't work with 1.4.0 any more and non AVX CPUs can't use lm-agent ?

 Tensorflow that i use form the link above is third-party, unofficial, built with sse2 support by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/fo40225&gt;@fo40225&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 user. He have build of 1.7.1 too, but only for cuda gpu, and it doesn`t work for me.

		Since we've switched from TensorFlowSharp to Barracuda, this issue is no longer relevant. I will close it for now. Feel free to open if you want to discuss more.
