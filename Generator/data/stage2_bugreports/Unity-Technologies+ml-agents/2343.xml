	<summary>The Unity environment took too long to respond</summary>
	<description>
I am using Pycharm (with the same code in this link: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/notebooks/getting-started.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/notebooks/getting-started.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) to connect to the toy enviroment from this link (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
Everything works fine until I lunch the script and I get a black screen then after few seconds I get this error:
"The Unity environment took too long to respond. Make sure that :\n"
mlagents.envs.exception.UnityTimeOutException: The Unity environment took too long to respond. Make sure that :
The environment does not need user interaction to launch
The Academy's Broadcast Hub is configured correctly
The Agents are linked to the appropriate Brains
The environment and the Python interface have compatible versions.
This happens to the editor and built versions. I am using python 3.6, I am using the Anaconda environment as set by the tutorial. I am correctly configured the Academy.
This enviroment works perfectly if I use "mlagents-learn" instead to train the agent. But some how when I use an external python API it freezes
Windows 10, version 1803
ML 0.8.2
This env: (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It is my first time posting, If I am missing something please let me know
