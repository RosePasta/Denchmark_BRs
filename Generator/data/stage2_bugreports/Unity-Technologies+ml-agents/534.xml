	<summary>Editor Crash with 2018.1.0b12</summary>
	<description>
When opening the project in beta 2018.1.0b12 selecting one of the TFModels assets crashes the editor. This happens with and without Tensorflow# installed. Sadly editor.log is barren and shows no signs of the crash.

		I noticed the same issue and can confirm the same behavior in 2018.1.0b13. For example, just simply selecting the bananaIL or PushBlock bytes files in their respective TFmodels folders crashes Unity.

 Does the same issue happen for newer version of Unity?
