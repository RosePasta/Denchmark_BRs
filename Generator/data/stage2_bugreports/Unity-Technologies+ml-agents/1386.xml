	<summary>It seems like there is a bug in the CoreBrainInternal.cs</summary>
	<description>
When I run multiple agents, the value estimates (from agent.GetValueEstimate()) are quite weird.
And I've found that there is a bug code in the following c# script.



ml-agents/UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/CoreBrainInternal.cs


         Line 439
      in
      d6dad11






 agent.UpdateValueAction(value_estimates[i,0]); 





while the var i  is declared, it is not increased in the loop, thus not updating the value estimates of the
agents in the scene.
I correct it as follows and it seems work.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;            var i = 0;
            foreach (Agent agent in agentList)
            {
                agent.UpdateValueAction(value_estimates[i,0]);
                ++i;
            }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Hope it might be helpful !
