	<summary>GPU inference bug</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Inference with GPU start outputing all 1s for it act[] vector after a few seconds. With CPU it works as intended.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Download the test environment here
Open the Scene/Env
Set the Brain/Brain to CPU/GPU
See the Debug.Log(act[]) in the console

Console logs / stack traces
There is no error or stack trace
Environment :

OS + version: Windows 10
GPU: GTX 1060 &amp; GTX 1080, lastest drives.
ML-Agents version: ML-Agents v0.10.1
TensorFlow version: 1.14.0
Environment: custom minimal env here

Additional notes
The model used is a nature_cnn with two LSTM layers with 512 units each and it outputs 4 continuous values.
I have tested in 3 different machines and had the same problem

		It is a bug. Workaround discussed there: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/2769&gt;#2769&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'm not sure if they are related. Here I use only a single visual observation and continuous action space  without any mask. It only happens when using inference with an already trained model inside Unity with GPU inference select (using CPU inference works fine).
If it is really related could you elaborate how and which work around I could use?

		(I am commenting on this because I opened the mentioned &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/2769&gt;#2769&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 bug. That bug happens even if you use CPU. I do not think that these 2 issues are related. I changed EPSILON to a lower value and it worked  up to a certain degree. It still  be fixed. My change was inside models.py but it was for discrete vector space type. This issue may be related to nvidia graphics card or cuda versions, etc.. I am not sure, I did not follow the steps to reproduce this (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/2784&gt;#2784&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) issue.)

Did anyone tried to reproduce the bug?
Is it in your plans to reproduce/look at/fix it?
Having no official reply is discouraging as barracuda is closed source and we depend on you to look at it.

		This issue is on our backlog, but at the moment I can't tell for sure when fix will be available.

		We have found what is causing this issue and expect it to be fixed with ML-Agents upgrade to Barracuda 0.3.x, which we expect to happen soon.

  It seems to be working properly Thanks!
I'll test it more deeply later, but so far so good.

 Great! The changes are on develop now, and will be in the next release (hopefully around Dec 2nd).
