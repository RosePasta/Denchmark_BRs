	<summary>Error with latest Version of Barracuda 0.5.0 on MacOS</summary>
	<description>
Error:
Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/InferenceBrain/ModelRunner.cs(56,57): error CS1061: 'NNModel' does not contain a definition for 'Value' and no accessible extension method 'Value' accepting a first argument of type 'NNModel' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
System: macOS Catalina 10.15.3
Unity Versions, I have tried: 2019.3.0f6, 2018.4.14f1
&lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Steps to reproduce:&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;


Start an empty 3D Unity project
Import ML-Agents
Install the latest version of Barracuda (0.5.0)
Error appears

Using Barracuda 0.4.0 works fine for me. But in your Docs, it is stated.

Search for or select the Barracuda package and install the latest version.

So I wanted to report that.

		I had same problem, and this solution works fine for me.
System: Windows 10
Unity Versions: 2019.3.0f6
It can be associated with Unity Versions. I did not find any information about this problem in Docs

		I had the same with Baracuda 0.5.0 on Unity 2019.2, Win 10.
Return to 0.4.0 works fine.

		If you really want to use the 0.13.1 release with barracuda 0.5.0, I put the fixes on the hotfix-0.13.1-barracuda0.5.0 branch.
