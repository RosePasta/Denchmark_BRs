	<summary>Training behavior changed dramatically</summary>
	<description>
Since I upgraded my ML-Agents environment from V0.12 to 0.13 something weird is happening with the training: It is much faster than before, nearly ten times, bit reward is increasing just slowly
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Upgrade ML-Agents from V0.12 to V0.13
Start 3DBalls example
Open Tensorboard and watch the Progress

Please take a look at the reward and the time needed for the training
I am using:

Windows 10
ML-Agents version: V0.13.0
TensorFlow version: 2.0.0
Environment: 3DBalls
Unity Version: 2019.3.0f1

I'm not sure if this is a bug. Did some parameters change?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RK4444&gt;@RK4444&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, in the most recent  branch, we changed the way steps are reported - they are now per-agent rather than per environment. Since there are 12 agents in the 3DBall scene, we'd expect there to be 12 times more steps than before.
However, this change has not been officially released yet. We recently changed our release process so that master is the active development branch. For the latest stable release (0.13), check it out using this command:
git clone --branch latest_release https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git

		Thank you for your answer. Initially I didn't understand what that means, but with your explanation everything is clear now.
