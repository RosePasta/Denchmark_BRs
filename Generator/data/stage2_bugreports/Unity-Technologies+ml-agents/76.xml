Hi there.
When I train with a camera observation,
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'PngImageFile' and 'float'
is raised in python during training.
Is this a bug or it could because my wrong configuration ?
I am sure there's not errors in my Unity3D environment.

python/unityagents/environment.py
in _process_pixels(image_bytes, bw)
140         s = bytearray(image_bytes)
141         image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(s))
--&gt; 142         s = np.array(image) / 255.0
143         if bw:
144             s = np.mean(s, axis=2)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'PngImageFile' and 'float'

		Hi @SPINACHCEO,
I think this may be related to your version of Pillow. Can you let me know what version it is?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/awjuliani&gt;@awjuliani&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I think I am using the latest version.
I don't think this could be the problem with Pillow cause it only throw "sometimes".
Usually around 1000~2000 successful steps.
Could this because of some problem with socket ?

		@SPINACHCEO,
What is the size of the camera observation you are trying to send over? I believe there is an issue when sending cameras over which are larger than 100x100 or so.

		Hi, thanks. I was using 128 * 128. And that's the problem.
Please forgive me if there is any documentation that already mentioned this.
