		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/haoxiangli6&gt;@haoxiangli6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

This seems to be an issue caused by the font being used in your console. The logo is designed to display with certain fixed-width fonts, which yours seems to not be one of.

		Weirdly, it actually doesn't look like that font's character width is too inconsistent, but it is likely still the cause.

To change the font in Windows 10 CMD:

search "Command Prompt" in the start bar
right click the result &gt; 'Open File Location'
right click the Command Prompt executable (now shown in the File Explorer) &gt; 'Properties'
click the 'Fonts' tab and select something monospaced (generally anything with Mono or Console in the name, or if there's a default selection)

Hope that helps! + Either way the logo is not going to affect the framework performance ðŸ™ƒ

		Sorry for the delayed response. Thanks for checking on this. We will try to see how we might resolve it so that we can avoid people seeing the deformed logo :)
We are tracking this internally with MLA-757
