	<summary>Outdated use_curiosity still in documentation</summary>
	<description>
I understand "use_curiosity" is superseded by the "reward_signals: ... curiosity: ..." syntax in config yaml files, but it still gets mentioned in the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#hallway&gt;Hallway example docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		This is not yet merged into master, by it seems it has been fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/3386&gt;#3386&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (10 minutes before your issue :) )

		Whoops, the PR was in response to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/JPhilipp&gt;@JPhilipp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
's forum post &lt;denchmark-link:https://forum.unity.com/threads/does-use_curiosity-still-exist.824040/&gt;https://forum.unity.com/threads/does-use_curiosity-still-exist.824040/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'll close this off, since it will be merged into master sometime this week (after the release is completed)
