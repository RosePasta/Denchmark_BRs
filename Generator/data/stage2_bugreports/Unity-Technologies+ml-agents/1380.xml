	<summary>Discrete Action Masking during inference</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
Is the discrete action masking only considered during training or is it also checked during inference (internal brain)?
I am adding the recently introduced action masking to my existing pre trained agents (0.4) and I notice that the agents are choosing the actions regardless of whether they are masked or not.

		Action masking was introduced in v0.5. If you are using an older model, the action masking will not work at inference time.
