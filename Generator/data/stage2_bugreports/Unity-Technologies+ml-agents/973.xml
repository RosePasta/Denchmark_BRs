	<summary>PushBlock documentation might be outdated</summary>
	<description>
The  environment &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#push-block&gt;doc&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 says the  vector is of size 15 and contains position and velocities.
But the  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/unity-environment/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/PushBlock/Scripts/PushAgentBasic.cs#L77&gt;code&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  appears to be adding vectors of ray perception at different angles and object detections
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;AddVectorObs(rayPer.Perceive(rayDistance, rayAngles, detectableObjects, 0f, 0f));
AddVectorObs(rayPer.Perceive(rayDistance, rayAngles, detectableObjects, 1.5f, 0f));
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

From the comments in RayPerception class, it directs rays at specified angles and  records detected objects (goal, wall and block in this case) and the distance to object?
I'm getting a 70 size vector in the env_info object.  Since there are 7 angles specified in CollectObservations, I'm thinking 10 size sub-vector for each angle?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hashbangCoder&gt;@hashbangCoder&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thanks for pointing this out! I've made a fix to the documentation in a hotfix branch, which will be merged into master soon: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/hotfix-0.4b&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/hotfix-0.4b&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
