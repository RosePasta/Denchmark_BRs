What is the best way to reset the scene?
I am developing a game like Bomberman. When an agent is in Done state, I need to reset the entire scene: return destroyed blocks, other agents and etc for initial position, But the academy reset only is called in the begging of execution or when the max step is reached.
If I implement a global reset on AgentReset then I need to manage each AgentReset.
Should I call this command?
SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name);

		You could implement AcademyStep() to check to see if the conditions are such that you need to reset the entire scene. If so, call Academy.Done(), which I believe will then trigger the AcademyReset() on the next cycle.
Reloading the scene would destroy your Communicator object and break the connection to Learn.py process.

 , on the documentation is write:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;/// The done flag of the academy. When set to true, the academy will
    /// call &lt;see cref="AcademyReset"/&gt; instead of &lt;see cref="AcademyStep"/&gt;
    /// at step time. If true, all agents done flags will be set to true.
    bool done;

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, I did the above code in MyAcademy, but the AcademyReset function was not called.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;public override void AcademyReset()
    {
        Debug.Log("Hello");
    }

public override void AcademyStep()
    {
        if (GetStepCount() == 100)
        {
            base.Done();
         
        }
    }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

In step 100 the academy should be reset.
Can I force the academy reset?

		The problem is in EnvironmentStep(). The test to reset on done is made before AcademyStep.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;if (done)
       {
           EnvironmentReset();
       }

       AgentResetIfDone();

       AgentSendState();

       BrainDecideAction();

       AcademyStep();

       AgentAct();

       if (done)
       {
           done = false;
           maxStepReached = false;
       }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then, after I set Done() in AcademyStep, the done is flag is set to false.

 , this is not a bug. I must change Academy status to done elsewhere. I just can not use AcademyStep to do this.
I still have not figured out where I can call the Done Function. I tried uncheck ResetOnDone in my Agent and implement in the AgentOnDone the call academy.Done (), but this is not works too.
EDIT:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vincentpierre&gt;@vincentpierre&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , this is a bug! There is no place in the code that externally changes Done that has the correct effect.

		I think the Environment step logic has changed in version 0.4 Does this error persist ?

		I did not test it anymore. But looking at the code, the flow is still the same.

		Has anyone solved the problem? I still have this issue with the last version of ml-agents (v0.5).

		I just tested the following code in a new component :
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;using UnityEngine;
using MLAgents;


public class AcademyResetTest : MonoBehaviour
{
	private int test = 0;
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
		
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update ()
	{
		test++;
		if (test &gt; 10)
		{
			FindObjectOfType&lt;Academy&gt;().Done();
			test = 0;
		}
	}
}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

And the Academy was reseting every 10 steps as expected. I tried something similar in the Academy Step and Reset logic in version 0.5. What is the problem you are experiencing and how can I reproduce it ?
