	<summary>Latest_release Tag</summary>
	<description>
Maybe not a bug per se but why does the "latest_release" tag redirect you to tag 0.13.0 rather than to 0.15.1?

		Thank you for signaling this to us. (I think it does qualify as a bug)
We have made 0.15.1 the latest_release and we will be investigating why the latest_release was set to 0.13.0.
For reference : MLA-956
