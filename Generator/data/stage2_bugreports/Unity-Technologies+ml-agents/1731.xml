		Have to ask an embarrassing question.  What did I miss here.  The recorder script is added to teacher agent in banana collector.  Press play and click the box and then ...

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/whiteGhost333&gt;@whiteGhost333&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thank you for your comment, I was able to reproduce your issue.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to check the  box at runtime, the box has to be checked at initialization. So you must 1. Click the box 2. Press Play

would assume then that it should be unchecked in every other circumstance.
