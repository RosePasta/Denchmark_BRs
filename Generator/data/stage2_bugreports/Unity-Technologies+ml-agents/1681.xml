	<summary>setup.py should install bleach 1.5.0 and not 3.1.0</summary>
	<description>
Doing
pip install -e .
cause this =&gt;

The 'bleach==1.5.0' distribution was not found and is required by tensorboard

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/16424&gt;tensorflow/tensorflow#16424&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

because it's installing bleach 3.1.0 while the current version of tensorboard require 1.5.0
solution =&gt;
pip install bleach==1.5.0

		I was not able to replicate this issue, and pip installed bleach==1.5.0 just fine. Perhaps you already had bleach from a previous Python package? Creating a virtual environment should help with dependency issues in Python (&lt;denchmark-link:https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/&gt;https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)
We will be upgrading to a newer build of TensorFlow in the near future, which should remove this dependency entirely. In the meantime, please use the TensorFlow issues page to discuss this.

		I did with a virtualenv
steps:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e mlagents
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I just repeated your steps and did not get this error. Are you on Linux or Mac OS X?

		I was also able to install ml-agents on Ubuntu 18.04 without issue. Does pip complete? It is likely you can still run ml-agents even without the bleach library.

		Strange, I tried again, still

pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'bleach==1.5.0' distribution was not found and is required by tensorboard

well anyway it's not very important I just have to run
pip install bleach==1.5.0
(I can't run mlagents-learn without installing bleach 1.5.0 btw)

		Interesting - I did manage to get this message, but I had a newer version of Bleach. mlagents-learn still ran. We'll take a look, but glad you found a workaround.
