	<summary>TensorflowSharp .so filenames</summary>
	<description>
Hello!
To get started on Linux with your wonderful ml-agents, I downloaded
&lt;denchmark-link:https://s3.amazonaws.com/unity-ml-agents/0.4/TFSharpPlugin.unitypackage&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/unity-ml-agents/0.4/TFSharpPlugin.unitypackage&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
installed everything, tried to run a pretrained model and got error messages like:
Plugins: Couldn't open Assets/ML-Agents/Plugins/Computer/liblibtensorflow.so, error: libtensorflow_framework.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
I noticed that some of the files have the lib prefix twice in their name. Like liblibtensorflow_framework.so. Odd. Also
$ldd liblibtensorflow.so
....
libtensorflow_framework.so =&gt; not found
...
So I removed the duplicate lib prefixes. -&gt; Works!
Thought I should let you know. And thanks for your great work!
Best regards.

 Thank you for your information! You are right, I will update the unitypackage with the correction.
