	<summary>gym_unity:Could not seed environment AcademyDiscrete</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
As the title explains, it seems not possible to set the seed of my custom gym environment, built with Unity.
This causes my environment to spawn the same sequence of targets in every run.
It looks like the same issue reported in the obstacle-tower environment in this report &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env/issues/91&gt;Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env#91&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, however, it seems not fixed in the toolkit.
Console logs / stack traces
WARNING:gym_unity:Could not seed environment AcademyDiscrete
Environment:

Ubuntu 16.04
ML-Agents version: v0.10
TensorFlow version: 1.13.1
Environment: custom environment, very similar to the one in the documentation  (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Readme.md)

Additional info:
Manually setting a seed in the Agent script (UnityEngine.Random.seed = value;) solve the problem, but this way, one should build a different version of the environment for each seed.
