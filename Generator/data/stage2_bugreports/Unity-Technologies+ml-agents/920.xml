	<summary>Brain automatically gets disconnected on Play</summary>
	<description>
There is a bug which disconnects graph model if brain is instantiated from prefab.
Story:
Trained brain in a separate scene, wanted to bring it back into my main project and noticed how on Play model switches to not set position and "Please provide a tensorflow graph as a bytes file" is shown.
Needed:

Prefab containing at least academy and brain.
Use any trained model at hand.
Unity 2018.1.0b11(not strictly I think)

Steps to reproduce(minimal example):

Create empty game object to hold academy derived script and a child game object to hold brain script.
Make parent game object into prefab
Delete them from scene
Instantiate prefab back into scene
Put trained model into a brain(brain parameters should match with that of a model)
Press Play

Resulting behaviour:

No errors are thrown, brain graph model silently disappears from brain
It is possible to stop, add model once again and press Play, model will disappear again

Expected behaviour:

Model does not disappear without saying a thing(at least throw an error to understand what is wrong)

Found fix:
(1-4 as in reproduce guide)
4) Instantiate prefab back into scene
5) Switch Brain Type to External
6) Switch Brain Type back to Internal
5) Put trained model into a brain(brain parameters should match with that of a model)
6) Press Play
Resulting behaviour:

Trained model stays in place

This is not a party crusher, but is just annoying to switch brain types back and forth just to make it work.

 Why do you want to make the academy as a prefab?

		I have my whole AI playground as a prefab, so that I can toss it around from project to project easily.
Structure looks like this:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;ParentGO(prefabed)
&gt;&gt;Academy
&gt;&gt;&gt;Brain
&gt;&gt;Agent

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Is it considered to be a bad practice or a plain misuse? From what I see it works, just a small nasty detail where I have to switch brain types Internal -&gt; External -&gt; Internal for graph model to be usable.

		This is something valid but maybe currently not so urgent to be solved. We are actually working on changing the way brain gets stored, which is in this PR. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/903&gt;#903&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Potentially this might solve this bug.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/metamorphling&gt;@metamorphling&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 We will be changing the way Brains work in an upcoming release to resolve this issue. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.
