	<summary>Video Recorder plugin does not work with --num-envs &amp;gt; 1</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Video Recorder plugin does not work with --num-envs &gt; 1.
With more than one executable running, all instances tries to write to the same video file. The duration control  also wont work as intended because now the Academy steps are globally counted.
To Reproduce
Add the video recorder to any test scene. Build it and launch the training with --num-envs greater than 1 The generated videos cant be played correctly.
Console logs / stack traces
No logs stack-trace.
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS + version: Windows 10
ML-Agents version: 0.13.0+
Environment: Any example from ML-Agents

Possible fix
Make each instance open it own file (i.e by process id) or  make it run just for the first instance and also count it steps locally (for the video duration only).

 This is not a bug, it is the intended behavior.

Sorry if I'm being pedantic, are you sure that you understood what's happening?
If &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoEQICke7N4&amp;feature=youtu.be&gt;this video&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is "intended behavior" instead of &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE9hwIsIqk4&amp;feature=youtu.be&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, without a single line of text in the documentation, no error and no warning whatsoever, then please close this ticket.
Thanks

		For reference, this was logged in our internal tracker as MLA-750. I'm closing this issue because we're not supporting the video recorder any further and wont' fix the bug.
