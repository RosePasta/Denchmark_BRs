	<summary>Onnx model failing to import due to ConstantOfShape</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I have switched over to using PyTorch instead of TF1 and the training seems to be working fine.  However, when I copy the resulting model into my Unity project, it fails to import the file, complaining that ConstantOfShape is an unknown type.
I have tried with the latest official package and with an imported version of the latest code on github as of today (Oct27-2020).
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Copy this .onnx file into a Unity project using the latest ML Agents package.
Allow Unity to attempt to import the model.
See error

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/grimli333&gt;@grimli333&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - I think we just fixed this last night. Can you make sure you have up to commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/commit/72492272ef6e749dd43f0c23a7b4176bb23d2af4&gt;7249227&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 (PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/4608&gt;#4608&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
)?
(I'm assuming "ML-Agents version: latest from github" means latest master branch, not latest release)

		Thank you for your help.  I was pretty sure I pulled the latest from master this morning, but I was uncertain enough that I went ahead and pulled again.
What fortuitous timing that this bug would be fixed the very day I encounter it!  After training a new model with the latest code, it imports properly.
Once again, thanks for your prompt attention.

		Cool, glad that fixed it. The bug was only introduced late last week, so you just had bad timing :)
