Assets\ML-Agents\Scripts\ICommunicator.cs(6,19): error CS0101: The namespace 'MLAgents' already contains a definition for 'CommunicatorParameters'

Opened the UnitySDK folder on Unity 2018.3.1f1, the error showed as soon as Unity starts.

OS + version: Windows 10
ML-Agents version: ML Agents 0.10

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/luizbalestreri&gt;@luizbalestreri&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
We renamed the Communicator.cs file to ICommunicator.cs to be more closely aligned with Unity's coding conventions.  If you've copied the UnitySDK folder over, and didn't delete the old files this will happen.  Please delete the old UnitySDK folder and then copy the new one over.  This should solve your issue.
