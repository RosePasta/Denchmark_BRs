	<summary>Issues with Basic scenario from example environments</summary>
	<description>
I have a functional setup since I was able to properly train and run the 3DBall example. However when I tried to do the same with the basic environment, I'm getting an issue. I did not make any changes to the environment or scripts. My expectation was that each example environment was ready to be trained and run out of the box. Please let me know if I missed something.
Note that I am running this in Unity 2018.1.0b13 on Windows.

I set the brain type to External.
I produced a build exe.
I trained the model using Python. After 30K steps, I get a mean reward of 0.919, with a Std of reward of 0.127. I stopped the training, and the model gets saved.
I copy the bytes model file to the TFModels folder under the Basic environment example folder.
I switch the brain to internal, assign the model I trained to the Graph Model.
When I run the project in the unity editor, I get two errors (see below). Note that if I use the pre-included model that came with the sample (Basic.bytes), I get the same errors.

This error appears 9 times every time I run it:
(System.ExceptionArgument argument, System.ExceptionResource resource) (at :0)
System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentOutOfRangeException () (at :0)
System.Collections.Generic.List1[T].get_Item (System.Int32 index) (at &lt;e1a80661d61443feb3dbdaac88eeb776&gt;:0) CoreBrainInternal.DecideAction (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary2[TKey,TValue] agentInfo) (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/CoreBrainInternal.cs:195)

Academy.EnvironmentStep () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:477)
Academy.FixedUpdate () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:507)
This error keeps racking up for as long as I leave the project running:
ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: Agent (BasicAgent)

		I was able to reproduce and I will try to make a fix shortly. In the mean time, can you try to replace line 195 of CoreInternal Brain from :
List&lt;float&gt; state_list = agentInfo[agent].stackedVectorObservation;
for (int j = 0; j &lt; brain.brainParameters.vectorObservationSize * brain.brainParameters.numStackedVectorObservations; j++)
{
   inputState[i, j] = state_list[j];
}
to
List&lt;float&gt; state_list = agentInfo[agent].stackedVectorObservation;
for (int j = 0; j &lt; stateLength * brain.brainParameters.numStackedVectorObservations; j++) // This is the change
{
     inputState[i, j] = state_list[j];
}

 FYI, I have tried this again with version 0.3.1a and it is now working as expected. I will close this issue. Thanks.
