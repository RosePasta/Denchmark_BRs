	<summary>IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.</summary>
	<description>
While running the 3DBall example, I am getting IndexOutOfBounds exception for the Platform agent. Here's the snippet for the error

I thought changing the value of Action Size parameter in Inspector window to 8 might solve the issue, but that just gives me another error

		While putting together custom agents, Im seeing the same issue reported only though the Jupyter training function though (PPO book). Would love to figure this out :D
No matter how many states or changing state total within the inspector - it's returning the same result.
edit: Actually I'll probably create another issue as it may be unrelated, but has to do with the state index.

 It seems to me your brain has  set to 0 when it should be 8 and  set to 0 when it should be 2. In the Inspector on your  component, what are the  set to?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vincentpierre&gt;@vincentpierre&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the brain parameters  and  were indeed set wrong. But now that I changed these to 8 and 2 respectively, I am still getting below .

 I think you must change your action space type from discrete to continuous in your brain parameters. Let me know if this helps.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vincentpierre&gt;@vincentpierre&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, changing the action space to continuous has worked and the game is working fine now. Thanks a lot.
