	<summary>Curriculum Reset Parameters for starting lesson</summary>
	<description>
It seems that reset parameters for starting lesson is set by Unity's Academy script("Default reset parameters" Dictionary) instead of first set of parameters in JSON-file.
The other lessons take their parameters correctly from JSON-file.
I can simply set these parameters to the same values, but it's hard to remember to maintain them in two places.
