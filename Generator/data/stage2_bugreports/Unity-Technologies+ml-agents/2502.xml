	<summary>Issue installing on Mac OS</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I'm unable to install ML-Agents on my Mac.
Environment

Mac OS X (Mojave 10.14.5)
Unity 2019.2.0f1
ML-Agents version 0.9.2

I'm following this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md&gt;installation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 guide.
I'm using Unity 2019.2.0f1 and the Unity-SDK portion works as expected.
I've installed Python 3.6.
python3 -V
returns
Python 3.6.0
pip3 is installed.
pip3 -V
returns
pip 19.2.3 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip (python 3.6)
Globally installing ML-Agents by running
pip3 install mlagents 
returns no error.
By Running
pip3 show mlagents
I get
Name: mlagents Version: 0.9.2 Summary: Unity Machine Learning Agents Home-page: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents Author: Unity Technologies Author-email: ML-Agents@unity3d.com License: UNKNOWN Location: /Users/robertsolero/ml-agents/ml-agents Requires: mlagents-envs, tensorflow, Pillow, matplotlib, numpy, jupyter, pytest, docopt, pyyaml, protobuf, grpcio, h5py
However Running
mlagents-learn --help 
returns the following error
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/mlagents-learn", line 11, in &lt;module&gt; load_entry_point('mlagents', 'console_scripts', 'mlagents-learn')() File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 489, in load_entry_point return get_distribution(dist).load_entry_point(group, name) File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 2852, in load_entry_point return ep.load() File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 2443, in load return self.resolve() File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 2449, in resolve module = __import__(self.module_name, fromlist=['__name__'], level=0) File "/Users/robertsolero/ml-agents/ml-agents/mlagents/trainers/__init__.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt; from .trainer import * File "/Users/robertsolero/ml-agents/ml-agents/mlagents/trainers/trainer.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt; from typing import Dict, List, Deque, Any ImportError: cannot import name 'Deque'
I get the same error above trying to train a model by running the method below form the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Basic-Guide.md&gt;Basic Guide&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;


The error seems to come from the package "typing".
From the command line
pip3 show typing
I get
Name: typing Version: 3.7.4.1 ...
I tried to upgrade it by running
pip install --upgrade typing
And I got
Requirement already up-to-date: typing in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages (3.7.4.1)
Also uninstalled and re-installed but seems to not make any difference.
Can anyone help me trying to get it to work?
Thank you very much.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robertsolero&gt;@robertsolero&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
It looks like typing.Deque was added in python 3.6.1 &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/typing.html#typing.Deque&gt;https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/typing.html#typing.Deque&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

so it's not available in your version (3.6.0).
Are you able to upgrade to 3.6.1? If not, if you're comfortable modifying the source locally, you should be able to remove the imports and usage (it's only used for type annotations).
I'll review our min python version separately to make this clearer in the future.

Thank you for the fast support, much appreciated.
I can confirm the error is gone updating python to 3.6.1.
If I only knew it was that easy ;).
