	<summary>Abnormal steps and std of rewards updating</summary>
	<description>
I am trying to train a model with 3 agents with the same brain.
However, during the train, the updating of steps and std of reward is weird. Most of std is 0.000 and step weren't shown every 2000 steps(which was set in summary_freq). The effect after a long time training is actually bad and agents are still dumb.
And I also found that the training was stuck sometimes and it also led to the abnormal update of steps.
The update is mostly like:
INFO:unityagents: Brain: Step: 2000. Mean Reward: 1.175. Std of Reward: 0.000.
INFO:unityagents: Brain: Step: 4000. Mean Reward: 1.320. Std of Reward: 0.000.
INFO:unityagents: Brain: Step: 12000. Mean Reward: -3.601. Std of Reward: 6.692.
INFO:unityagents: Brain: Step: 24000. Mean Reward: -3.902. Std of Reward: 0.000.
INFO:unityagents: Brain: Step: 46000. Mean Reward: -31.675. Std of Reward: 0.000.
INFO:unityagents: Brain: Step: 48000. Mean Reward: -88.323. Std of Reward: 125.581.
