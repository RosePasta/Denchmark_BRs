	<summary>Error when "Reset On Done" set to true for some agents but not others</summary>

Describe the bug
Mixing agents where some are "Reset on Done" and some aren't causes PPO training to crash on Done
To Reproduce

Open one of the examples with multiple agents.  I used the Soccer example.  And set one of the agents to not reset on done.
Start PPO training.
When that agent reaches the Done state, the training will crash

		Nevermind.  Seems to be fixed in 0.9.2

		Actually, it is still an issue.  But only if curiosity is turned on.

		Hi,
We removed the "Reset On Done" option is the current master branch. To terminate an agent without resetting it, you can destroy its game object directly.
