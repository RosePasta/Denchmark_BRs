		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/harperj&gt;@harperj&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I created a new venv and pip installed
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;python3 -m venv someenv
pip3 install mlagents mlagents_envs
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also tried in another new venv:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git
cd ml-agents-envs
pip3 install -e ./
cd ..
cd ml-agents
pip3 install -e ./
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

With the same error on import both through python terminal or within Jupyter notebook. Running on Linux Ubuntu.

		I had the same issue. I copied the communicators_objects folder from Github ml-agents/ml-agents-envs/mlagents/envs/ into the Anaconda3\envs\YOUR ENVIRONMENT NAME\Lib\site-packages\mlagents\envs
Now it is working! The problem seems to be that the communicator_objects folder is not installed with the pip command

		I had to do the same with the PPO and bc folders. Only after that did the command work.

		do you copy the folder or do you take the elements out of the folder and put them into envs. I tried this and it seemed to work at first (so that MLagents-learn works) , but then later it seems to have problems when I try to run the 3D balls.

 You have to move  and  into  and  respectively to make it work. For some reason pip is not properly putting these subdirectories where they belong.
