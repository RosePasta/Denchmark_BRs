	<summary>Not all Environments connecting when running multiple concurrent training sessions.</summary>
	<description>
When starting multiple concurrent training sessions (e.g. --num-runs=6), some Unity Instances are unable to connect to python.

As seen in the image, Assembly-0 and Assembly-1 are not connected and give no results.
Using time.sleep(5) after starting a new process in learn.py helped.
