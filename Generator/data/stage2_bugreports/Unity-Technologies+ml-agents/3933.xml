	<summary>Heuristic method called but not implemented</summary>
	<description>
The Agent class I made, ContinuousAgent, is calling the Heuristic method from the base Agent class instead of the override Heuristic method I created in the ContinuousAgent class.
I am using ml-agents-release-1.
I successfully created and trained the RollerBall tutorial without issues.
Within my own project, I created an empty GameObject for the Agent and added the BehaviorParameters component and DecisionRequester component. I created and attached a script called ContinousAgent that inherits from Agent to the object. I added override methods for OnEpisodeBegin, CollectObservations, OnActionReceived, and Heuristic. In the inspector in BehaviorParameters I changed the space type to continous and the space size to 2. I changed vector observation space size to 0 because I wanted to get the OnEpisodeBegin, OnActionReceived, and Heuristic methods working before I tried to do anything else. After I filled those functions with what needs to happen within my game, I tried to run it in the editor. When I run it, the console fills with the Debug LogWarning from the virtual Heuristic method from the base Agent class saying Heuristic method called but not implemented. I do not get this error from the RollerAgent example.
Thank you

		I don't know how it got there, but the Agent (Script) attached was causing the problem. I removed it and now it works
