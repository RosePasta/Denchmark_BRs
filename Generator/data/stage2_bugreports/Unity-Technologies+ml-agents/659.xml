	<summary>Visual Obs App with Internal Brain run via Python Issue</summary>
	<description>
I need help running a visual observation app with an Internal Brain via python.  The following python code works successfully with 3DBall compiled in internal mode.  However as soon as I run the same python code with the GridWorld app compiled in Internal mode which has Visual Observations (runs in Editor fine), I get the errors seen below:
import numpy as np
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
env_name = "GridWorld" # Name of the Unity environment binary to launch
train_mode = False # Whether to run the environment in training or inference mode
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name=env_name)
&lt;denchmark-h:h1&gt;Set the default brain to work with&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

default_brain = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[default_brain]
for episode in range(10):
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=train_mode)[default_brain]
done = False
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;while not done:
    env_info = env.step()[default_brain]
    done = env_info.local_done[0]

print("Test ended")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

env.close()

		As far as I know, you can only interact with an environment if the brain is set to external. If you only need the observations, you may be able to experiment with catching and ignoring any exceptions that come up.

		Ok, Here is a what I think is a fix : In unity-environment/Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/ExternalCommunicator.cs replace line 287 :
    /// Contains logic for coverting texture into bytearray to send to 
    /// external agent.
    private byte[] TexToByteArray(Texture2D tex)
    {
        byte[] bytes = tex.EncodeToPNG();
        //Object.DestroyImmediate(tex);     &lt;-- Comment this line
        //Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets();   &lt;-- Comment this line
        return bytes;
    }
Please let us know how that went.

  I have not, that is because there might be some unintended consequences commenting those lines. I do not know if it could cause issues for intensive image based scenarios. The issue should be resolved on the  branch since the image collection code changed.

 Ok, I will keep this open and revisit it once your communicator branch has merged.

		My brain Type is set to External, but I still get this error: WARNING:unityagents: No External Brains found in the Unity Environment. You will not be able to pass actions to your agent(s).
Am I missing any other settings?

 Can you post a separate issue regarding this and give more information like &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RossMelbourne&gt;@RossMelbourne&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 did? I am going to close this issue.
