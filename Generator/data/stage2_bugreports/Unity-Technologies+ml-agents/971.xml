	<summary>Possible bug in RayPerception -- sends 1 extra float for each angle</summary>
	<description>
For each angle passed to RayPerception, the following floats are sent to the network:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;0-1 (distance)
0 or 1 (for each tag)
1 (always sent)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So, for example, if you have 1 angle and 2 tags (A and B), and the ray hits tag A, you send:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;.5 (distance)
0 (tag B boolean)
1 (tag A boolean)
1 (always sent)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

As you can see, the 1 never changes. In this case, what's the point of sending it? Please explain if possible.

		I had a similar question in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/973&gt;#973&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there are 7 angles and vector of size 10 is returned for each angle for 3 tags in  example

		Hi All. There actually isn't a bug here. In the case of push block there are 14 rays sent, and 70 total observations. That means 5 observations-per-ray. Three of those correspond to the three objects to be detected. One corresponds to whether nothing was detected, and the final one corresponds to how far away the detected object is.
