	<summary>.bytes model is not being saved</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I'm having a lot of trouble trying to get the .bytes model during the training. Currently I'm trying the 3Dball enviroment. I do all as the docs say. I run:

python learn.py ball --save-freq=1000 --train

And in the Anaconda console it actually says "Saved Model" when it reaches the save frequency:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38359058/38772873-2f1d8a7c-4041-11e8-8c7b-22fafc54ca30.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

But the only files saved in the models folder are the following ones, theres not a .bytes file:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38359058/38772875-368695ba-4041-11e8-9ebd-ba4ef214730e.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I actually managed to save the .bytes file by letting it train and when it reached a mean of 100 it saved itself. But what I really want to know is how to actually save it whenever I want. I am really frustrated and I don't know what to do. Am I missing something?
I know this is not happening only to me, as others have posted about this, but didn't really get an answer:

		Hi, You can decrease the number of steps performed with --max-step=X. This way you can interrupt the training sooner and the model will be saved. I hope this helps.

		I couldn't change it that way, it just said:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38359058/38773088-8aed412c-4045-11e8-8377-6b9e8313546d.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and stopped. But changing it in the trainer_config actually worked, so thanks!!

		You could also immediately end the training and get the .bytes file by pressing Ctrl + C in Anaconda. Your problem is a bug &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/543&gt;currently being addressed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		This bug has been fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/1558&gt;#1558&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. The error message
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;forrtl: error (200): program aborting due to control-C event
Image PC Routine Line Source
libifcoremd.dll 00007FFDAFF994C4 Unknown Unknown Unknown

KERNEL32.DLL 00007FFDF2131FE4 Unknown Unknown Unknown
ntdll.dll 00007FFDF226EFC1 Unknown Unknown Unknown
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

still exist, which is related to this stackoverflow &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42653389/ctrl-c-causes-forrtl-error-200-rather-than-python-keyboardinterrupt-exception&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42653389/ctrl-c-causes-forrtl-error-200-rather-than-python-keyboardinterrupt-exception&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Our fix get around this error by adding another ctrl-c event handler which saves the model before this error.

		Can one generate a .bytes model when training through jupyter notebook ? &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/xiaomaogy&gt;@xiaomaogy&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Yes you can (not it is .nn file instead of the .bytes file). You just need to move the corresponding code from our python code into the jupyter notebook. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Usmaniatech&gt;@Usmaniatech&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
