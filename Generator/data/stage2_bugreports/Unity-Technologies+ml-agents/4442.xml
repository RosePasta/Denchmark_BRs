	<summary>colab notebooks fail to run Unity environment</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
When running the Colab-UnityEnvironment-2-Train.ipynb colab notebook the step that runs the Unity environment hangs
from: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_6/docs#python-tutorial-with-google-colab&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_6/docs#python-tutorial-with-google-colab&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Follow the link to the colab notebook for Q-Learning with a UnityEnvironment
Run each cell in succession.
Observe the output from the cell that loads the Unity environment from the registry (last cell for the Q-learning notebook)

Console logs / stack traces
From running the last cell of Colab-UnityEnvironment-2-Train.ipynb

     99                 '\t The Agents\' Behavior Parameters &gt; Behavior Type is set to "Default"\n'

UnityTimeOutException: The Unity environment took too long to respond. Make sure that :
	 The environment does not need user interaction to launch
	 The Agents' Behavior Parameters &gt; Behavior Type is set to "Default"
	 The environment and the Python interface have compatible versions.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment (please complete the following information):

Machine: Running colab from the link. I'm on a windows machine if that matters.
ML Agents version: Used the version linked under the release_6 tag. The notebook pip installs mlagents==0.17.0.
Environment: GridWorld

NOTE: We are unable to help reproduce bugs with custom environments.  Please attempt to reproduce your issue with one of the example environments, or provide a minimal patch to one of the environments needed to reproduce the issue.

		Couple updates:

The Colab-UnityEnvironment-1-Run.ipynb works.
Colab-UnityEnvironment-3-SideChannel.ipynb also works.

The fix for Colab-UnityEnvironment-2-Train.ipynb:

go to the last cell
change the environment loading call to:

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;env = default_registry["GridWorld"].make()
# env= UnityEnvironment(file_name = None)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(in the default code the two are flipped to:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;#env = default_registry["GridWorld"].make()
env= UnityEnvironment(file_name = None)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zookae&gt;@zookae&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 -- thanks for the bug report. I've updated the colab notebook to load from the registry.
