	<summary>Bug with --lesson command line argument</summary>
	<description>
When trying to resume from a previous lesson, providing the --lesson command line argument currently does not jump you straight into that lesson. Instead, the first lesson is started. When completed, the lesson counter is incremented from the value provided by --lesson and you jump to that lesson.
For example, I provide --lesson=3. I expect to start at the 4th lesson (0, 1, 2, 3). Instead, I start at the 1st lesson (0). When I complete that, the lesson counter is incremented (3+1) and I proceed to the 5th lesson (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
I think I see the area in the code it can be fixed and I would be willing to explore that and file a PR unless you already have a fix coming down the pipeline.
