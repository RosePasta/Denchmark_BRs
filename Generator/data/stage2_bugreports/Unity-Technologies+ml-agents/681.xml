	<description>
I've only observed this on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/649&gt;#649&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 after leaving my PC to train for a few hours unattended it will dump this error

the  unity-environment.log file just says this repeatedly
 Error An abnormal situation has occurred: the PlayerLoop internal function has been called recursively. Please contact Customer Support with a sample project so that we can reproduce the problem and troubleshoot it.

		I have this problem too. I set max_steps = 5.0e6 and I left the training running all night. When I went to use the model in inference I got the same error.
