	<summary>Small error in game Logic - Tennis</summary>
	<description>
Rewards for the agents are decided by a hitWall script on the ball. This script has one error-
(The following code are from lines 45 to 74 from above script)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;            if (collision.gameObject.name == "wallA")
            {
                if (lastAgentHit == 0)
                {
                    agentA.AddReward( -0.01f);
                    agentB.SetReward(0);
                    agentB.score += 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    agentA.SetReward(0);
                    agentB.AddReward(-0.01f);
                    agentA.score += 1;
                }
            }
            else if (collision.gameObject.name == "wallB")
            {
                if (lastAgentHit == 0)
                {
                    agentA.AddReward( -0.01f);
                    agentB.SetReward(0);
                    agentB.score += 1;
                }
                else
                {
                    agentA.SetReward(0);
                    agentB.AddReward( -0.01f);
                    agentA.score += 1;
                }
            }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What's happening here is that if the lastAgent was 0 which means agent was A, and it hits wall A, which is the wall behind agent A's racquet, he gets a penalty and B scores. And also, if B hits A's wall directly, he gets the point.
However,  in this part,
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;            else if (collision.gameObject.name == "wallB")
            {
                if (lastAgentHit == 0)
                {
                    agentA.AddReward( -0.01f);
                    agentB.SetReward(0);
                    agentB.score += 1;
                }
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

It again checks for agent A's hit and penalizes it for hitting B's Wall.
I propose changing
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;                if (lastAgentHit == 0)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

to
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;                if (lastAgentHit == 1}
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

(in the first if statement in the block where it checks for wallB. )
This should resolve the issue.

		I seemed to have made a mistake while dealing with the ball-wall logic, the current code is perfectly fine. I apologize for wasting your time
