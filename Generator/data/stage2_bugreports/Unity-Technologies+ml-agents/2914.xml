	<summary>Visual sensor shape dimensions are swapped in v0.11</summary>
	<description>
The shape dimensions of CameraSensor and RenderTextureSensor are swapped in v0.11.
To reproduce, set non-quadratic shape size like 96x48 in sensor component.
Python console log:
ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (1, 48, 96, 3) for Tensor 'visual_observation_0:0', which has shape '(?, 96, 48, 3)'
The problem appears to be the line
m_Shape = new[] { width, height, grayscale ? 1 : 3 };
in CameraSensor  and RenderTextureSensor constructors.
The error disappears after changing it to
m_Shape = new[] { height, width, grayscale ? 1 : 3 };

		Thanks for catching this. I'll update our examples to use non-square visuals to hopefully prevent anything like this from happening again.

		This is fixed on the develop branch now, and will be in the next release.
