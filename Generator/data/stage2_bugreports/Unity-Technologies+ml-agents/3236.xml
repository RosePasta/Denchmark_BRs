	<summary>Bug in SoccerTwos-Example: The Heuristic method was not implemented</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I have cloned the ml-agents-repo and opened the SoccerTwos-Example and hit the play-button but the editor paused and I recived the following errormessage:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;UnityAgentsException: The Heuristic method was not implemented for the Agent on the PurpleGoalie GameObject.
MLAgents.Agent.Heuristic () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Agent.cs:473)
MLAgents.HeuristicPolicy.DecideAction () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Policy/HeuristicPolicy.cs:35)
MLAgents.Agent.DecideAction () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Agent.cs:909)
MLAgents.Academy.EnvironmentStep () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:407)
MLAgents.AcademyFixedUpdateStepper.FixedUpdate () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:32)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I tested it on "0.12-version", "0.13-version" and with "git clone --branch latest_release" like in the installation-instuction.
Will the heuristic function be implement in future, or does the error lie elsewhere?
Greeting,
markus

		We currently do not have a model trained for the soccer environment and there is no heuristic method implemented.
