	<summary>Cannot connect with Academy on macOS Catalina</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
Specs: macOS Catalina, Unity 2019.1
When running my project, I'm getting the following error message:
„libgrpc_csharp_ext.x64.bundle“ kann nicht geöffnet werden, da Apple darin nicht nach Schadsoftware suchen kann.
-&gt; Loosely translated: cannot be opened because Apple cannot search the file for malicious software
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Import ml-agents
Add Academy GO
Run Play
See error

I'm unable to connect my mlagents-learn to Unity, I assume this is due to this

		To specify, it's this error:

Seems that the program libgrpc_csharp_ext.x64.bundle needs to be notarized

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/spaggi&gt;@spaggi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, we can't comment on Catalina since it's unreleased. But you may have to disable some of the security settings in System Settings -&gt; Security and Privacy, at least until libgrpc is updated for Catalina.
Leaving this issue open for our reference as Catalina becomes available.

		Thanks for your response &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ervteng&gt;@ervteng&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. You can disable this check by disabling Gatekeeper with the following terminal command:
sudo spctl --master-disable
Everything works again once this is done.
However I would advice to update libgrpc_csharp_ext.x64.bundle before Catalina becomes public, as every Mac user will face this issue then.
I'd love to help but this is beyond my knowledge unfortunately - I don't even understand what this bundle is....

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/spaggi&gt;@spaggi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Looks like we will need to code sign these binaries for use on macOS Catalina.  We'll update you when we have done so.  Thanks for the report!

		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/spaggi&gt;@spaggi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I now have Catalina installed on my machine and have not run into these issues.  If you can still reproduce this issue, please reopen this issue. Thanks for your input.
