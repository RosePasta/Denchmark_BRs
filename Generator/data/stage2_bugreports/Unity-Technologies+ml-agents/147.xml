	<summary>tf.miltinomial does not work in Android</summary>
	<description>
tf.miltinomial does not work in Android, though it works in Unity editor and Standalone in mac and linux. The error message is below. I tried this in tensorflow 1.0, 1.2 and 1.3 and Android APK 23 and 24. I dont know if this error is due to ml-agents. I also reported this as an Issue of tensorflow &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/14150&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

		HI @matsui-k20xx,
Thanks for pointing this out. It is likely that the TensorFlow binary for Android does not contain the  op. It is possible to build TensorFlow on Android manually with the desired set of ops. See here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/android_build&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/android_build&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Given that  is used in our PPO implementation, it is something we will add to the default TF Android binary.

		Resolving this as we have fixed this in v0.3 of ML-Agents. Let us know if you have any questions.
