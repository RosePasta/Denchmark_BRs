	<summary>Tensorflow error.</summary>
	<description>
Hi. Does anyone know what is this problem and how to correct it? It happens after I train my agent and set the *.bytes on the brain.
ArgumentException: start

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/satansama6&gt;@satansama6&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I have unfortunately not seen this error before. Can you share a little more about the specific environment you trained?

		I can't test it atm but could the problem be that the batch size is &gt;= buffer size? I was messing with the values and randomly got the error. When i reduced the batch size the error went away.

		batch-size should definitely not be larger than buffer-size. Though, I am not sure why it would give a TensorFlow error.

		I don't know what caused it but it is resolved for now. If i get it again I will try to document it better. Thank you.
