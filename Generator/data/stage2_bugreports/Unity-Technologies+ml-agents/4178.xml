	<summary>Detactable Tags in Ray Perception Sensor3D are not working</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I would like to use Raycast for deteching one thing however it collides with every collider in the scene.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1.Clone &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Hsgngr/Pandemic_Simulation.git&gt;https://github.com/Hsgngr/Pandemic_Simulation.git&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

2. Open the project with Unity  Path: Pandemic_Simulation\ml-agents-release_3\ml-agents-release_3\Project
2. Click on 'Assets/PandemicSimulation/Scenes/T1'
3. Inpect PandemicArea&gt;PandemicAgent.RayPerception Sensor 3D
4. See the error.
Screenshots
The agent's ray perception sensor (blue one) hits another cubes sphere collider which I only want to use for triggering certain actions. I dont want to detect that. There is another collider which I would like to reach.

My agent has 2 colliders. SphereCollider is for triggering some actions and the other one is a cube collider which is attacthed to a child of this agent. This child object has ColliderCube tag and in my Detectable Tags: I am only giving wall and ColliderCube

Desired Behaviour

It hits directly to the box collider (I deactivate other sphere collider)
Environment (please complete the following information):

Unity Version: Unity 2019.40f1
OS + version: Windows 10
ML-Agents version: mlagents Release 3
TensorFlow version: 2.2.0
Environment: FoodCollector

		I solved the problem by using Layers. I added a new layer for the agent prefab and only added this to the parent object. I took the cube collider and put that as a child. Then I changed only parent's layer. I closed IgnoreRaycast from Project Settings/Physics (InfectionLayer is the agent layer)
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32769732/86138640-6442a880-baf7-11ea-83d4-98e74d411583.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I unchecked the Ray Layer Mask &gt; InfectiousLayer in RayPerceptionSensor3D
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32769732/86138664-6b69b680-baf7-11ea-9831-302536a197c3.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and voila. Now it hit as it should.
