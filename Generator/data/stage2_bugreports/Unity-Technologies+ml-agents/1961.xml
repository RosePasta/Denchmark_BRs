	<summary>"UnityActionException: The episode is completed." with --num-envs &amp;gt; 1</summary>
	<description>
Running v0.8.1 I get the following error when --num-envs is greater than 1. The error happens at the step where AcademyReset() should be called (30k steps in our case).

mlagents.envs.exception.UnityActionException: The episode is completed. Reset the environment with 'reset()'```
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/WHiT3R4bBiT&gt;@WHiT3R4bBiT&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I was able to reproduce your bug. I modified the  environment Academy script this way :
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using MLAgents;

public class Ball3DAcademy : Academy
{
    int numToReset = 10;
    int numStep = 0;
    public override void AcademyReset()
    {
    }

    public override void AcademyStep()
    {
        numStep ++;
        if ( numStep &gt; numToReset){
            Done();
            numToReset = Random.Range(100,200);
            numStep = 0;
        }
    }
}
This error seems to arise when the the environments do not need to reset at the same time. One of them needs to reset but not the other. In this situation, a STEP command might be sent while one of the environment was expecting a reset leading to the error you saw.
This is a bug, thank you for posting this issue. We will look into it. In the meantime, I would recommend not using Academy.Done at all in your environment and rely on Academy max step or Agent.Done.
