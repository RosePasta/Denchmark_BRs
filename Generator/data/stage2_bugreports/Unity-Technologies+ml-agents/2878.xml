		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/droidXrobot&gt;@droidXrobot&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
This is a known issue if you’ve opened the project with unity 2019.2.x or later.  I’ll try to find the issue to link back to.  In the mean time, the work around is to hook up the brains manually.  We hope to fix this in the coming weeks.
I will close this issue for now and update it when the fix is available.  Cheers.
