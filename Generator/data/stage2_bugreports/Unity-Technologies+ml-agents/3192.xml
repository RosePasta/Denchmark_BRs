	<description>
All the gpu memory is occupied in the beginning of training if I experiment with mlagents 0.13.0.
This phenomenon didn't happen until 0.12.1.
I experimented with 3DBall example on CentOS7, tensorflow 1.13.1.
I both tried PPO and SAC.

		Do you know if you are using the tensorflow cpu or the gpu version? Also are you using the xvfb or no graphics mode or xserver to render?

		I'm using tensorflow gpu version.
I'm experimenting on my local linux machine.
It happens in both '--no-graphics mode' is turned on or off.
