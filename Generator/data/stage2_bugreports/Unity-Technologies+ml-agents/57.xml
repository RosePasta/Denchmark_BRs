	<summary>Issues with Basic example</summary>
	<description>
After train Basic agent with PPO.ipynb and sending back the bytes file to Unity, console shows this error:
UnityAgentsException: Expects arg[0] to be int32 but float is provided CoreBrainInternal.DecideAction () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/CoreBrainInternal.cs:240) Brain.DecideAction () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Brain.cs:312) Academy.DecideAction () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:250) Academy.RunMdp () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:337) Academy.FixedUpdate () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:260)
I have checked that the Action space type is Discrete, any ideas?
&lt;denchmark-h:hr&gt;&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Try to use BasicDecision.cs return this error in console:
NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object BasicAgent.AgentStep (System.Single[] act) (at Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/Basic/Scripts/BasicAgent.cs:25) Agent.Step () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Agent.cs:209) Brain.Step () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Brain.cs:324) Academy.RunMdp () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:346) Academy.FixedUpdate () (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:260)
Easy fix replacing line 9 with this:
return new float[1]{ 1f };

		Thank you for testing this part of ML-Agents. Both the issues you raised are bugs that need to be addressed. I made a change in the development branch . The fix you made for the second issue is the right one I believe because the error you were getting is because the default  is null.
If you want to fix the first error, you can implement what I did in this commit &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/commit/16c12f5e7cfefb49355d64a36c3002f0e56982d3&gt;16c12f5&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Basically, the state is a  by default that needs to be converted into an  if the state space type is discrete. I hope this helps.
