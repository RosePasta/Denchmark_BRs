	<summary>AcademyReset called twice</summary>
	<description>
When Academy is done, I found that AcademyReset function is called twice every done condition.
Current episode count: 2          &lt;--- print(GetCurrentEpicode())
UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:print(Object)
RobotAcademy:AcademyReset() (at Assets/Scripts/ReinforcementLearning/RobotAcademy.cs:24)
MLAgents.Academy:EnvironmentReset() (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:597)
MLAgents.Academy:EnvironmentStep() (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:572)
MLAgents.Academy:FixedUpdate() (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:605)
Current episode count: 3
UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:print(Object)
RobotAcademy:AcademyReset() (at Assets/Scripts/ReinforcementLearning/RobotAcademy.cs:24)
MLAgents.Academy:EnvironmentReset() (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:597)
MLAgents.Academy:ForcedFullReset() (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:506)
MLAgents.Academy:EnvironmentStep() (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:542)
MLAgents.Academy:FixedUpdate() (at Assets/ML-Agents/Scripts/Academy.cs:605)
One from normal EnvironmentReset() and the other is in ForcedFullReset().
I also found episode count is count up twice in every Done condition.
Is it possible to call AcademyReset function just once in Done condition?

		I am having the same issue, when I am training with default mlagents-learn script. This does not happen when I set the Brain Type to "Player". I believe the ForcedFullReset() is invoked by the mlagents-learn script.

		Hi, can you confirm you are still having this behavior on v0.6 ? The environment might reset twice in a row at the beginning of the simulation when connecting to the python process. This is because the first command that is being sent by python is a reset command.

		This is still happening for me on v0.6a.
At the start it's only called once via ForcedFullReset() under else if (!firstAcademyReset).
Then every time my Academy hits Max Steps I get two AcademyReset() calls, one via the if(done) in EnvironmentStep() and then one fixed update later one via ForcedFullReset() under if (brainBatcher.GetCommand() == CommunicatorObjects.CommandProto.Reset)
This may be related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/1687&gt;#1687&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which is also my project. We're using On Demand decisions in case that helps.

		When we do training with mlagents-learn, we call reset manually when the Academy is done. I think this is what is causing the problem. The Academy resets once because its done flag has been set to true and then the python process calls a reset manually. This way of reseting the environment is sub optimal indeed, is it causing problem in your environment? My guess is that it should only messes up the counting of the episodes. Am I wrong ? Is it causing other issues ?

		I haven't seen any other issues caused by this.

		In my case, I have two screens (VideoPlayer) showing different videos (e.g. Video A on Screen 1, and Video B on Screen 2) and I want to swap the videos (Video A on Screen 2, Video B on Screen 1) between the two screens at the end of each episode (when AcademyReset() is called). But since AcademyReset() is called twice, the videos are swapped twice, and as a result the same videos are played on the same screens.

		Hi all. For the next release of ML-Agents we are cleaning up some of the logic in Academy, and this issue should be resolved. As such, I am closing this issue.
