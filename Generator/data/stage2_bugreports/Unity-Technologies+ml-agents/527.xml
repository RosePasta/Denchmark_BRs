	<summary>Unity sends wrong Type for Vector Action Space -----Training not working</summary>
	<description>
hey, I am just starting to use this repository. After I went succesfully through the 3DBall sample (with Jupyter Notebook and learn.py) I wantet to use the framework in my own project. This is the error I am getting:

Can anybody tell me what it means? In my game I only did some float obervations therefore I cant see where there could be a "type error".
Thanks =)

		well... I found the problem but don't know how to solve it:
in the line:
self.vector_action_space_type = ["discrete", "continuous"][brain_param["vectorActionSpaceType"]]
the last part brain_param["vectorActionSpaceType"] is an enum in Unity, which should return 0 for discrete and 1 for continues Mode.
This would make the above statement for continues mode to:
["discrete", "continuous"][1] which takes the second Element "continues" from the list.
In my case Unity sends an string ('continues' or 'discrete') to Python Api what results in a Type Error.
I added a print statement of the brain_parameters in the Python API to show it:

Any ideas? =)

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/freiSMS&gt;@freiSMS&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, have you tried our latest master branch which uses learn.py for training?
