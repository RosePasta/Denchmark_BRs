	<summary>Timeout exception when launching with docker</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I use UnityEnvironment to train my agents on 3D_Ball by passing it a path to the Unity executable. When building and launching both on windows 10, everything works fine and I'm able to train well. However, when building a linux image from windows and launching the training with the same config with a docker on a linux machine, I get a timeout exception:

mlagents_envs.exception.UnityTimeOutException: The Unity environment took too long to respond.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Pull docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:2.1.0-gpu-py3-jupyter
Install all else as in https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/Dockerfile
Build the environment from windows for linux
Try to create the gym environment

mlagents_envs.exception.UnityTimeOutException: The Unity environment took too long to respond. Make sure that :
	 The environment does not need user interaction to launch
	 The Agents are linked to the appropriate Brains
	 The environment and the Python interface have compatible versions.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment (please complete the following information):

OS + version: Windows 10 &amp; Ubuntu 18.04
ML-Agents version: 0.14.1
Unity version: 2019.3.3f1
TensorFlow version: Doesn't matter as I train with the gym wrapper, but it's 2.1.0
Environment: 3D_Ball

What I've tried:

Running the environment with docker_training=True
Exposing the port 5005
Building in headless mode (server mode)

		HI &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ReinforcedMan&gt;@ReinforcedMan&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, currently our docker feature has been deprecated. As you could imagine with various version of OS and tensorflow version and training configuration and gym versions, it would be super hard to maintain.
The error you get means the unity environment didn't get connected to the python process within a certain amount of time, but the reason behind it is unclear without further digging into it.
