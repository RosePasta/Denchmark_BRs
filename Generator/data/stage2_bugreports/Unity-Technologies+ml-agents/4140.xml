	<summary>SOLVED_ Release 3 issue - Trainer config must have either a "default" section, or a section for the brain name</summary>
	<description>
with the past release everything was working fine, now i got this message
File "c:\users\dj\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\trainer_util.py", line 100, in initialize_trainer
f'Trainer config must have either a "default" section, or a section for the brain name ({brain_name}). '
mlagents.trainers.exception.TrainerConfigError: Trainer config must have either a "default" section, or a section for the brain name (Frogger2AI). See config/trainer_config.yaml for an example.
i also tried with "Frogger2AI" instead of default, but nothing changes... i copied the config file from the new ppo folder
this is my config file:
