While I try to train my agent on tensorflow, Unity freezes during training. Here is profiler:

		Does this happen with the provided example scenes? If not, the problem is likely due to a bug in your code. If you post it, I can try to help debug it

 Thank you for your help, I found that my code was responsible for the freezing. I used recursive function for calculation it was working while playing normally, yet it produces freezing while training.
