So I've tried to run the learn.py program using the following command:
mlagents-learn /config/config_trainer.yaml --train --run-id=test
However, it keeps returning this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "c:\users\jpste\anaconda3\envs\ml-agents\lib\runpy.py", line 193, in _run_module_as_main
"main", mod_spec)

from trainer_controller import TrainerController
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'trainer_controller'
I followed the instructions as told multiple times, restarting a few instances, yet I keep getting this error. I'm honestly lost as to what I did wrong at this point...

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TrollOfAllTrolls&gt;@TrollOfAllTrolls&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Can you let me know what platform you are using, and how you installed the mlagents python package?
		</comment>
		<comment id='2' author='TrollOfAllTrolls' date='2018-10-20T13:58:20Z'>
		Oh right, I should have clarified that I'm using windows. I used Anaconda to install the mlagents python package, first creating the ml-agents environment. I then installed all the necessary content from the requirements file in the ml-agents folder

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/TrollOfAllTrolls&gt;@TrollOfAllTrolls&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

We have updated our installation process for v0.6, could you try it using the new system and see if the error persists?

		Hello,
Excuse me for jumping in, but, this is wigging me out.  I also have an Anaconda, tensorflow  installation and I went back to 2017.4.18 which seems the safest.  I was working with 2018.2.14 and actually had better luck in that in one shining moment I was able to connect with 3DBall environment but could never get it to repeat the trick.
Here's a python log which has me in a choke hold :
(ml-agents) c:\Users\msi\Downloads\ml-agents&gt;mlagents-learn C:\Users\msi\Downloads\ml-agents\config\trainer_config.yaml --env=3DBall --train

Any pointers or comments would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!

		I was planning on doing a reinstall in order to compare the results.  I

difference is I used 'pip install -e .'

		Voila !!!..I was able to connect to the 3Dball scene build...this is after
running  pip install pypiwin32, of course.  See below.  One item which
surprised me was that I did not get the build results
I expected , i.e. the learning brains are in scene but not the build.  I
must have missed something there?
