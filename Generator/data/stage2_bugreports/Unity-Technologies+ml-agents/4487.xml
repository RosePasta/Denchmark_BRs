	<summary>Actuator folder not present when installing from Package Manager</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I wanted to explore the available Examples but I  can't use the library whenever I install from the package manager as the Unity.MLAgents.Actuators namespace is never downloaded.
To Reproduce
Just download the latest version using the unity package manager.

Environment:

Unity Version: Unity 2019.3.13f
OS + version: Windows 10
ML-Agents version: 1.0.4 but it also happened with every package version I tried (every single one available except the preview ones)

		The IActuator interface was added after the 1.3.0-preview release. You'll need to install from the master branch, or wait for 1.4.0-preview, which should be out this week.
