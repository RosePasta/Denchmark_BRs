I am getting an AttributeError while running the 3rd cell of the PPO jupyter notebook. Not sure what is causing this. Please help.

		A easy workaround is removing the lines 10, 88, 89, 99 and 100 from /python/unityagents/environment.py. That's not a nice solution but at least it is working this way.

 is a duplicate of this.

		This should be addressed now with recent push to master: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/9&gt;#9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please let me know if this works for you.
