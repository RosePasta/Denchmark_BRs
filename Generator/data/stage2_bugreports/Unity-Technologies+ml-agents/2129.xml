	<summary>Demonstration Recorder not functioning properly</summary>
	<description>
When I record my gameplay and then exit play mode in the editor, the demonstration files don't show up immediately. I then switch tabs and come back and find the demo files. These files, though, are corrupted and were not saved properly. This issue happens also when you're playing and you switch tabs and come back: the script can't open the file because it's "already open".
With short experiences, this will sometimes work. Other times, it doesn't. I haven't figured out how to splice the data files yet so I have a couple hours of demo files that can't be used.

		Update:
I found out a bit more information. Whenever the file is over ~15kb the system fails to read the file. This may not be the recorder's problem but the file reader. Here is the error log:
  File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\runpy.py", line 193, in _run_module_as_main "__main__", mod_spec) File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\runpy.py", line 85, in _run_code exec(code, run_globals) File "C:\Users\Figur\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\Scripts\mlagents-learn.exe\__main__.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt; File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\learn.py", line 262, in main run_training(0, run_seed, options, Queue()) File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\learn.py", line 95, in run_training tc.start_learning(env, trainer_config) File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\trainer_controller.py", line 205, in start_learning self.initialize_trainers(trainer_config) File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\trainer_controller.py", line 149, in initialize_trainers self.load_model, self.seed, self.run_id) File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\bc\offline_trainer.py", line 44, in __init__ self.policy.sequence_length) File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\demo_loader.py", line 46, in demo_to_buffer brain_params, brain_infos, _ = load_demonstration(file_path) File "c:\users\figur\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages\mlagents\trainers\demo_loader.py", line 82, in load_demonstration brain_param_proto.ParseFromString(data[pos:pos + next_pos]) google.protobuf.message.DecodeError: Error parsing message

		After extensive testing, I found the solution to the problem with saving the demo files: when the "Demonstration Name" field is set to anything with a length over 18, either the file won't be formatted correctly or it won't be read correctly. Length 19 will never work, but other length 26 and length 23 can work sometimes.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Abahu&gt;@Abahu&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks for pointing this issue out. It is actually a known issue that will be addressed in the next release of ML-Agents.

		This issue was fixed with 0.8.2. Closing this issue for now, feel free to open it again if it's still an issue.
