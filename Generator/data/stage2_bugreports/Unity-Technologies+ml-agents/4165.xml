	<summary>Roller Ball Decision Requester issue and policy update</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I have few questions about the decision requester. When I increase the period of decision in the RollerBall tutorial, it speeds up the game. Why is it happening ?
I also wanted to know if a policy adjustment for a PPO trainer is what we call a decision taken by the agent.
If we set the decision requester period to 1, a decision is going to be taken at each steps ? Does it mean the PPO policy is going to be updated at each step ?
Or, is the PPO policy updated only at the end of an episode ?
Thank you for your help !

		Closing since I assume this was moved to the forums before it was assigned to me.
