	<summary>UnityTimeOutException: The Unity environment took too long to respond.</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
I cannot run training in Unity editor. When Issuing command mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --train I get

mlagents_envs.exception.UnityTimeOutException: The Unity environment took too long to respond. Make sure that :
The environment does not need user interaction to launch
The Agents are linked to the appropriate Brains
The environment and the Python interface have compatible versions.

When running via same command but by pointing to build .exe file(mlagents-learn --env=../foo.exe config/trainer_config.yaml --train), all works fine.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run Unity and open Project using ml-agents
Open windows command line and issue command mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --train

		I'm having this issue but I have only installed ml-agents via Pypi in the instructions. I haven't tried the ones included in the repo.
Edit: I couldn't get it to work with the alternate installation method: pip3 install -e ./ml-agents and ml-agents-env
I will try to make a fresh python env and retry all that.
Edit: a fresh python environment didn't work via PyPi

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/RaStall&gt;@RaStall&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I'll try to reproduce your error.

		I tried just pressing play in the Unity editor when I was waiting for the timeout and it began training.

		<comment id='4' author='RaStall' date='2020-03-26T18:17:45Z'>
		Shouldn't mlagents display a message in the console with the prompt to Press play?

		<comment id='5' author='RaStall' date='2020-03-26T21:11:04Z'>
		It used to, maybe it was removed.  Did you get it to work?

		I see the print out is still there



ml-agents/ml-agents-envs/mlagents_envs/environment.py


         Line 132
      in

 f"Start training by pressing the Play button in the Unity Editor." 





If you press play in the editor after you launch mlagents-learn, you should see it work.

		Yeah, I was able to get it running by pressing play after launching mlagents-learn, but it's really confusing without the print, as most tutorials state that I should wait for "Start training by pressing the Play button in the Unity Editor." print in the console.
