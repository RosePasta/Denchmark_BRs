	<summary>Wrong WallJump demo curriculum json filenames in 0.6</summary>
	<description>
Just to let you know that in 0.6, the curriculum JumpWall demo config files have wrong names "SmallWallBrain" and "BigWallBrain". Python expects it to be "SmallWallJumpLearning" and "BigWallJumpLearning" according to the brain names in the Unity project.

		By the way, I'm having a blast playing with ML-Agents. I'm training racing vehicles to avoid obstacles and getting really good results. Thank you so much for your work!
