	<summary>Hallway example scene fails to build "Failed to create Physics Mesh from source mesh "WallsOuter" (New Unity versions)</summary>
	<description>
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Try to build the Hallway example scene with the latest 2020.1 Unity version

Result:

Build fails with error:
"Failed to create Physics Mesh from source mesh "WallsOuter". One of the triangles is too large. It's recommended to tesselate the large triangles.
UnityEngine.GUIUtility:ProcessEvent(Int32, IntPtr, Boolean&amp;)"

Note: this is a regression from the Unity side. In previous Unity builds this would fail silently, after error handling update it will stop the build, so it should be fixed from the ML-agents example project side.

 I replaced the wall mesh with primitives. Can you try this branch and let me know if it fixes this?
