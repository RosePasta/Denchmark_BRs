	<summary>Sample project tennis learning is slowly training, need fixing script?</summary>
	<description>
Hi.
I try to run sample project "tennis learning" but agents seems to be trained slowly.
The below result was obtained with the original hyper parameters.
[terminal's output]
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;INFO:mlagents.trainers: tennis-0: TennisLearning: Step: 1000. Mean Reward: 0.009. Std of Reward: 0.038. Training.
INFO:mlagents.trainers: tennis-0: TennisLearning: Step: 10000. Mean Reward: 0.030. Std of Reward: 0.053. Training.

INFO:mlagents.trainers: tennis-0: TennisLearning: Step: 30000. Mean Reward: 0.085. Std of Reward: 0.112. Training.
INFO:mlagents.trainers: tennis-0: TennisLearning: Step: 40000. Mean Reward: 0.978. Std of Reward: 0.927. Training.
INFO:mlagents.trainers: tennis-0: TennisLearning: Step: 45000. Mean Reward: 1.332. Std of Reward: 1.000. Training.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I noticed that both agentRb and ballRb refer to Agent's Rigidbody in  TennisAgent.cs.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/Tennis/Scripts/TennisAgent.cs&gt;Here original script link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Line 28   agentRb = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody&gt;();
Line 29   ballRb = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody&gt;();
Line 30   var canvas = GameObject.Find(CanvasName);
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Line 29,  " ballRb = ball.GetComponent(); " is correct ?
According to the script context, agent needs ball's velocity to decide next action.
Fixed script gave below results, maybe this is going well.

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Thank you.
