	<summary>Model is only created for one training run</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
if I use more than one run (e.g. --num-runs=10 --run-id=run), I expect each run to output a model.
However, only one model is saved throughout all sessions.
With the given run-id, I'd expect 10 sub-directories in the models directory named like this:

run-0-Brain
run-1-Brain
...
run-9-Brain

It works as expected for the summaries.
I observed this behavior for v0.7.0 on Windows and Ubuntu 16.04.

		Can you please redirect me to a tutorial describing how to use unity inference engine? I am new to unity and I don't know where to start to integrate my deep learning model in unity.

		In learn.py:52 I changed
model_path = './models/{run_id}'.format(run_id=run_id)
to
model_path = './models/{run_id}'.format(run_id=run_id) + '-' + str(sub_id)
to fix this issue.

		Since we've deprecated --num-runs option, this bug no longer exist, so I'm going to close it for now. Feel free to reopen if you find more issues with it.
