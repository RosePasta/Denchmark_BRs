	<summary>Can't get mlagents-learn to use Tensorboard-gpu</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
So I'm trying to get the 3DBall example learning with my GPU instead of my CPU. In the tutorial provided you say that I need to uninstall Tensorflow and install Tensorflow-GPU (1.7.1). If I do that and run mlagents-learn I get an error saying it there's no module called tensorflow. Installing both just makes Tensorflow no longer recognize my GPU.
To Reproduce

Uninstall tensorflow
Install tensorflow-gpu (1.7.1)

		Can you try this:
Change parameter in the ml-agents/ml-agents/setup.py:
"tensorflow&gt;=1.7,&lt;1.8" -&gt; "tensorflow-gpu&gt;=1.7" then install that setup.py with  pip install -e . And make sure you installed CUDA and CUDNN.

Just tried this, still uses the CPU. Should I also uninstall regular TensorFlow?

I made a mistake in pip -e . it must be pip install -e . Then i tried, both versions installed and there was no problem. Make sure you saved everything after changing setup.py

I just ended up assuming you meant pip install -e ., and yes I did save the file. I just checked the setup.py and saw it was still changed to tensorflow-gpu.

		Have you resolved this issue? I'm getting the exact same error when running mlagents-learn, after uninstalling 'regular' TF and installing the TF-gpu as mentioned in the Installation-Windows doc

I have not, no. Could be an issue with TensorFlow 1.7
