	<summary>"Decision Frequency" property name is confusing</summary>
	<description>
This is different from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/779&gt;#779&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
The higher the "Decision Frequency" the lower the actual frequency at which decisions are made.
The property should be called "Decision Period" instead.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/danaugrs&gt;@danaugrs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , this is kind of confusing from your perspective. However 'Decision Period' seems more confusing.

		Personally decision period makes more sense to me.

 this is confusing from the perspective of anyone who understands what &lt;denchmark-link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency#Definitions&gt;frequency&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 means. The "Decision Frequency" property measures the interval of time between decisions (i.e. the period),  as its name suggests!
If I increase the "Decision Frequency" property value, it will lower the actual decision frequency.
If I lower the "Decision Frequency" property value, it will increase the actual decision frequency.
The period is the reciprocal of the frequency, and that's the quantity measured. The current name is not just confusing - it's plain wrong.
Another idea for the new name is "Decision Interval".

		Hi all. I agree that `Decision Frequency' is not a good name. We will meet and come up with a new name to use.

		My 2 cents: Decision Interval is better than Decision Period.
Interval means: "an intervening time or space."
Period implies that it takes that long to make a decision, where in fact, the decision still happens in one simulation step no matter what the frequency/period/interval is.
