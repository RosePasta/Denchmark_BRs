	<summary>Issue with barracuda and 'Compute' worker on not supporting gpu mobile</summary>
	<description>
Describe the bug
During barracuda runtime I get the following message:
"compute shaders are not support on current platform. falling back to csharpfast"
To Reproduce
Run barracuda on mobile device using Compute worker type.
Environment (please complete the following information):
Huawei Honor running on Kirin 620, emui 4.1.3.
Barracuda 0.2.4
Android
NOTE:
The barracuda worker works with CSharp as I select it manually.
It seems like it tries to change the worker to CSharpFast, but it doesn't work afterwards.
As much as I'm acknowledge with barraduca - it CSharpFast have changed to CSharp,
I would suggest that fixing this reference would solve the problem.

		Hi Ervin,
Barracuda works with Editor (Windows) and both Android and iOS builds. It
tested with different devices, but this specific phone model didn't work
with "Compute" worker, so I had to change it to "CSharp".

 Kirin 620 comes with old generation Mali450 GPU, which doesn't support OpenGL ES 3.1 / Compute Shaders, so Barracuda won't work on this GPU.
