	<summary>Installation issues</summary>
	<description>
After following the installation documentation and installing Python 3.7.9, pip's newest version, pytorch, and mlagents I get an error (see Screenshot) when running: "mlagents-learn --help" to see if the installation was successful. I hope someone can help me with that issue. I am sorry if I post this issue in the wrong section here - I am kind of new to this.

OS + version: Windows 10
ML-Agents version: 0.22.0

		Also to add something: there were no errors while installing pytorch or mlagents with pip. Also, I can execute the line "from torch._C import *" (last line indicated by the error traceback) without any errors when I run python normally in the console.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Krephix&gt;@Krephix&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Can you verify that numpy was correctly installed, and that you only have one version installed on the machine?

I had numpy previously installed outside the virtual environment with version 1.18.1. After your message I checked the installed numpy version inside the virtual environment and for some reason 1.19.4 was installed, which must have been done by either pip install pytorch or mlagents, because I didn't do anything else in the virtual environment. Even while 1.19.4 was installed pip install mlagents --use-feature=2020-resolver didn't throw any errors and also didn't reinstall numpy with a different verion. Maybe because of the installed numpy outside the virtual environment?
running: pip install numpy==1.18.5 manually solved the issue now and I can correctly see the output from the command "mlagents-learn --help". Thank you for pointing me in the right direction.

		Glad you were able to get things fixed. Having multiple numpy versions on the same machine can sometimes conflict with one another, which was my hunch.
