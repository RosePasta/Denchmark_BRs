	<summary>Imitation Learning Error</summary>
	<description>
I am getting the following error when training imitation learning. I have added the complete terminal log below. The game starts as expected, but it ends as soon as I take the second action (for the agent with "Teacher" brain). On running the game in the Unity, I am able to control the agent with "Teacher" brain.  Broadcast is checked for the "Teacher" brain.

I would greatly appreciate any help. Thanks.

		I think you found a bug. I will try something about it. Can you try something for me ? In python/unitytrainers/bc/trainer.py replace lines 188 to 189 :
Replace
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;                if info_teacher.text_observations[idx] != "":
                    info_teacher_record, info_teacher_reset = info_teacher.text_observations[idx].lower().split(",")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;                if stored_info_teacher.text_observations[idx] != "":
                    info_teacher_record, info_teacher_reset = stored_info_teacher.text_observations[idx].lower().split(",")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Let me know if that does the trick.

		I was able to reproduce the bug by setting the decision frequency of the banana teacher to 2 instead of one. The above code seems to fix it. Let us know.

		Yes, it works now. Thanks!

		I am not certain that this directly related but it is very similar. When trying to tensorboard, I receive the following message :
(ml-agents) C:\Users\msi&gt;tensorboard --logdir=summaries

 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
This occurs after an apparently(no reason to think otherwise) successful training in 3D Ball Learning.
Thanks
