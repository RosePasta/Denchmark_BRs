	<summary>Importing ml-agents doesn't include its scripts within Unity</summary>
	<description>
Hi all,
I've been experimenting with ml-agents, tested the example environment, and was able to run and train the balancing project.
However, when I try to build my own project from scratch, ml-agents doesn't seem to get imported correctly.
When for instance,

create empty project
drag the UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents folder into my project's Assets folder
3 make an Empty gameObject and try to put the ml-agents c# brain script in it as a component, unity doesn't find it:

What's going wrong?

Unity version: 2019.2.9f1
OS + version: Mac OSMojave
ML-Agents version:  0.11.0

		I was following this tutorial, but I noticed that i can still just inherit from ml-agents classes. I guess the video was doing this in an archaic way. Closing this for now
