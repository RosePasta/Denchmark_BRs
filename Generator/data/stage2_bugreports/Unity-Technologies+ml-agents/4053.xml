		why should you use 2019.1.0a8 ? can't you at least try with a stable release like Unity 2019.1.14 ?

		From the stack trace, it seems like the Agent script is missing from your agent. In 3DBall, this is called Ball 3D Agent. Is this true?

		The problem is solved with the Unity 2018.4.17.   I am new to Unity and don't realize the incompatible between versions
