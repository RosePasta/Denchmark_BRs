New installation of 0.9.2 with new conda py env.
-using the UnitySDK and running the 3DBall
-player brain on one of the agents Learning brain on the rest, academy with two brains (player and learner)
Nothing unusual with the setup or command (mlagents-learn config\online_bc_config.yaml --train --slow)
Obviously I changed the brain to imitate line in the default onlineBC yaml file to 3DBallPlayer

Windows 10 ML-Agents 0.9.2 3DBall
Any ideas?
Just tried 0.9.1 with the hotfix and can get offline training working, then switched back to 0.9.2 and tried the same (with the correct env) and received the attrib error again.

Same error with offline training using the basic model and a demo file.

		Fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/pull/2498&gt;#2498&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - during a refactor, the step initialization got moved to  instead of  which explains why it didn't affect PPO training.
We'll work on some more automated testing to make sure there's better coverage on the BC Trainer code.
