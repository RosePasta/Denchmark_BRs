	<summary>Training proces slow down over time, is it normal ? + Masking doesn't work</summary>
	<description>
Hello !


I am new to Unity ML, i am not sure this is a bug but there is a problem that it got so far: It run very fast at the beginning, but then it take significantly longer and longer to run x amount of steps. When i stop the training and resume, the same thing happen again (fast at first, then slow down).


I checked my environment, did some scanner and snapshot during the test and nothing seem wrong, CPU/RAM/Player Loop/number of Object ... all seem normal. Also if my environment is the problem, it should take longer bit by bit for every loop, not a huge change at some random point. I am making a simple Blackjack game, not something crazy with visual or gameplay.


Here is the report, please take a look at the time elapsed.


Also Discrete mask doesn't work in my case too. I check it with my code and got it.




In CollectDiscreteActionMasks: mask 2 if CanDouble = false
  if (CanDouble == false)
      actionMasker.SetMask(0, new int[] { 2 });     



In OnActionReceived: Still choose 2 after mask 2
  if (CanDouble == false &amp;&amp; vectorAction[0] == 2)
      Debug.Log("Mask 2 doesn't work: ");



Thank you in advance.

----------------------- As you can see, before this point, training only take under 10 seconds to run 5000 step. After this point, it take significantly longer. Like 70s =&gt; 90s =&gt; 100s...
