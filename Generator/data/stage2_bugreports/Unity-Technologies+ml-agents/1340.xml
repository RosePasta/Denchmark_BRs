	<summary>Two environments with the same seed bug</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
I think there's a bug in the Python API (or maybe just with the Gym wrapper). If I create an environment with the seed 0, and then try to create another environment with the same seed (in a different application) this will cause the first environment to crash. I think the bug was introduced with the version 0.5.
It's really a big issue, for example if you're training an agent with python, the training crash when you launch your environment in the Unity Editor. Here's the error that I get:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;  File "/home/cyrili/gym/gym/core.py", line 330, in step
    return self.env.step(action)
  File "/home/cyrili/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gym_unity/envs/unity_env.py", line 131, in step
    info = self._env.step(action)[self.brain_name]
  File "/home/cyrili/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mlagents/envs/environment.py", line 384, in step
    self._n_agents[_b] = len(s[0][_b].agents)
KeyError: 'Brain'

&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cyrilibrahim&gt;@cyrilibrahim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I just tested this out on my own machine using v0.5, and was not able to reproduce this bug. It is possible to launch multiple concurrent instances of an environment on the same machine. Doing so however requires that the worker_id parameter be unique for each instance of the environment. This parameter corresponds to the port used for communication, and as such using the same value for multiple environments will lead to conflicts.

		Thanks for the quick answer!
Yes I agree that each environment should have a different worker_id on the same machine, but if by error I launch another environment with the same worker_id, I'll loose my first environment. The new launched environment should crash and the first one continu to run no matter what happened in other applications. But the inverse happens, the first one crash and the new one continu to run.
Maybe it's just a problem on my machine since you can't reproduce it.
Thanks again !

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cyrilibrahim&gt;@cyrilibrahim&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , yes this is currently the case. If you launch the second environment with the same worker_id as the first one, the first one will crash without saving the model. We will mark this bug and try to fix it in later version.

		We have since fixed the issue where a subsequent environment launched with the same worker_id will cause the first to crash.  Closing this issue.
