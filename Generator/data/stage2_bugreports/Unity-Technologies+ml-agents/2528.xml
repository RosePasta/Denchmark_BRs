	<summary>Cannot run --train on Mac OS</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
I cannot run any --train command on my Mac OSx.
Environment
Mac OS X (Mojave 10.14.5)
Unity 2019.2.0f1
ML-Agents version 0.9.3 [Also replicated with  0.9.2]
Python 3.6.8 [Also replicated with  3.6.1]
Tested using "UnitySDK" Project folder, as well as a custom Environment/Project in Unity.
Description
I successfully installed ML-Agents after some troubles.
I tested a pre-trained model on Unity and I'm now attempting to train my own model.
When I try to run
mlagents-learn ../config/trainer_config.yaml --run-id=firstRun --train
as well as
mlagents-learn ../config/trainer_config.yaml --env=../myExecutable.app --run-id=firstRun --train
I get the following error(s):
socket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known
mlagents.envs.exception.UnityWorkerInUseException: Couldn't start socket communication because worker number 0 is still in use. You may need to manually close a previously opened environment or use a different worker number
raise EOFError EOFError
mlagents.envs.exception.UnityCommunicationException: UnityEnvironment worker: recv failed.

After updating python to 3.6.8 the last 2 errors came up, before (Using python 3.6.1) I only got the first 2.
It looks like it might related to this &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/1505&gt;ISSUE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, the difference is that I cannot run --train even once. Moreover the API and usage seem to be changed substantially.
I tried to use Jupyter as well and the same issue come up.
On Jupyter, using the "getting-started" file, I tried to add on the step 3, a parameter worker_id=2 as follow
`env = UnityEnvironment(file_name=env_name, worker_id=2)
Set the default brain to work with
default_brain = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[default_brain]`
The console changed the index on the string, but the same error occurred.
Using the terminal and adding  resulted in not having the --train command processed, as it looks like to be removed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Migrating.md#migrating-from-ml-agents-toolkit-v07-to-v08&gt;HERE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Again, using the terminal and adding --base-port =5040(or any other number) returns the same error, where the initial console info showed a different base-port.
Not being an expert in python and socket communication, I'm quite stuck and I do not know where to start to close a port, or any other possible fix.
Hopefully someone can help me out and guide to a resolution.
Thanks.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/robertsolero&gt;@robertsolero&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
I think this is a different underlying error than &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/issues/1505&gt;#1505&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - in that issue,  raised  but yours raises . I think we're incorrectly treating this error with .
I'm not sure the best way to debug this, but it seems like there are some related stackoverflow questions, e.g.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39970606/gaierror-errno-8-nodename-nor-servname-provided-or-not-known-with-macos-sie (same error, but thrown from different place)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50376329/s-bind-nodename-nor-servname-provided-or-not-known
https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253817/cannot-ping-my-local-machine

Can you try some of the diagnostic steps there and see if you can get any socket binding (outside of mlagents) working first?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chriselion&gt;@chriselion&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
,
Thank you very much again.
I've been able to solve the issue, which isn't ML-Agent related, but due entirely to my machine.
To anyone that might face the same issue here what I did.
Before I couldn't run
ping localhost 
but
ping 127.0.0.1
worked as expected.
I followed these suggestions &lt;denchmark-link:https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/253817/cannot-ping-my-local-machine&gt;HERE&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

and tried the following:
Changing my local hostname, using System Preferences &gt; Sharing &gt; Edit.
sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
dscacheutil -flushcache
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
Then I changed my hosts file:
sudo nano /etc/hosts
Back up my old file contents.
Removed everything expect
127.0.0.1 localhost
Rebooting.
ping localhost 
Now works as expected.

		Glad that helped. I'll make an issue to try to make the error messages clearer in this case (since UnityWorkerInUseException isn't really appropriate)
