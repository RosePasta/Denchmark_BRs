Image.save() doesn't seem to be working properly on python 3.6 . Same lines of code with same SFrame work properly in 2.7.13 but not in 3.6

		I was able to repro this issue with turicreate 4.3.2, but not with turicreate 5.0 (which we released a week or so ago). If you are on turicreate 4.3.2, try upgrading to turicreate 5.0!
If you still see this issue on turicreate 5.0, please reopen, as something more interesting is going on!
