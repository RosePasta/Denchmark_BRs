 what version of Turi Create and OS are you using? I'm unable to reproduce this error with Turi Create 5.8, Python 2.7 (as above), on macOS 10.15.1.

		I am able to reproduce this on Linux. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/znation&gt;@znation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Is this feature expected to work on Linux also? The documentation doesn't say it's Mac only.
