	<summary>.explore() results in blank window on Linux</summary>
	<description>
From &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/baizhenmao95&gt;@baizhenmao95&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
:

If I run "data.explore()" on my PC, I could only see a blank window. And the icon of the turi create visualization is a red prohibition symbol within a rectangle.
My PC Information:
Ubuntu 17.10
Inter i3-7100
8GB
turicreate 4.3.2/5.0b1
(no GPU)


But if I run it on the computer in my laboratory, I could see the data and the images.
But there are also a question. When I use the object detection and put the cursor on the thumbnail, I could just see a some image. It's too small to see it clearly. I have no idea how to enlarge them.
This computer's information:
Ubuntu 16.04
Inter i7-7700K
16GB
turicreate 4.3.2/5.0b1
(NVIDIA GEFORCE 1080Ti,but I didn't use GPU because I have no idea on installing CUDA)
