	<summary>Model Evaluation Doesn't Steal Focus</summary>
	<description>
Calling model.evaluate(test_set).explore()does correctly open an explore window. However that window load in the background the user needs to alt-tab to the correct window to see it.
This is particularly confusing if it's the first time the user has called explore or if the user already as several explore windows open.
