	<summary>Trying to select two entire rows in table view ends up selecting many more...</summary>
	<description>
On macOS High Sierra under Debug build. It works if I end at the second column but I can't select two entire rows (including row numbers) regardless of whether I start at the top left or the bottom right. Image attached.

Fixing these issues would require a rewrite of TC. Prioritizing the scroll behavior over the selection behavior. Removing Selection wouldn't allow individuals to copy and paste, prioritizing that functionality.
