	<summary>median in int column in SFrame summary not correct</summary>
	<description>
Import turicreate as tc
sf=tc.SFrame({'A':[1,2,3,4],'B':['a','a','b','b']})
sf.show()
Expected:
Median for “A” is 2.5.
Actual:
Median for “A” is 3.

 This seems by design, can't tell if this is better or worse
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import turicreate as tc
sf=tc.SFrame({'A':[1,2,3,4],'B':['a','a','b','b']})
sf.show()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

shows median of 3 because its float
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import turicreate as tc
sf=tc.SFrame({'A':[1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0],'B':['a','a','b','b']})
sf.show()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

shows median of 2.5 because its float
I don't find that unreasonable.

		Agreed - according to &lt;denchmark-link:https://math.stackexchange.com/a/47806&gt;this StackOverflow post&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, there isn't really consensus on what integer median should mean when there are an even number of integers in a set (and in the case where there is an odd number of integers, clearly one of the integers is exactly the median). Closing this issue as By Design.
