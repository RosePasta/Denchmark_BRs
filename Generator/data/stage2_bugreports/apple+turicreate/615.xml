	<summary>Turi create memory error-&amp;gt; MemoryError: std::bad_alloc  in GPU &amp; CPU machine</summary>
	<description>
I have trained turi create model in CPU machine for 4k dataset and got memory error
Total dataset size : 103.7 MB, Single image size in KB only .

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5689804/40827195-875f7c62-659a-11e8-9dff-1de2a0a6507b.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have referred memory error already posted in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/267&gt;#267&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and updated batch_size parameter as 32 and still got same issue

		I have run turicreate script in GPU (AWS Deep learning -&gt; g2.2xlarge configuration) and got bad alloc error for same dataset. PFA

Analyzed object_detector code for batch_size, it seems value is updated as 32

Please let me know anything needs to be done

 The batch size you modified was for image classifier. You need to do it for OD. Can you try it with
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = tc.object_dector.create(dataset, 'annotation', _advanced_parameters = {'batch_size': 16})
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		I don't think this is a batch size issue, since this happens before neural network training begins. I think the issue is that you have large images in the SFrame, and we are not handling that as well as we should. A temporary work-around is to try to resize them before passing them into create. The network takes images in the size 416x416, so having your images around that size is ideal. Obviously, we are actively looking for a better solution. Sorry for the inconvenience!

		I just saw that you said single images are on KB only, so they are not large after all (at least not in file size). That is a bit more surprising. Let me ask you this then. What is the largest image in terms of width x height area in the dataset? That is, it can be small in file size, but large in dimensions (an example of an image that could fit such description is an image with large flat regions, with lots of potential to compress the image).

 Thanks for the info! These are not particularly large images indeed.
Not sure if this will help, but &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/384&gt;#384&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 has some discussion around memory errors and suggests the following:
tc.config.set_runtime_config('TURI_FILEIO_MAXIMUM_CACHE_CAPACITY', 2*1024*1024*1024)
Let me know if you find any success adjusting this value. Thanks!

		I think to reproduce this and related memory issues, the key is probably the environment as opposed to the specific dataset. I will set up an environment with less RAM and see if I can repro.

Meanwhile I like to share list of issues, I had faced during turicreate training process in GPU.
Run turicreate with 859 images and itâ€™s successfully completed and generated coreml model

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5689804/41145577-321ba490-6b1e-11e8-9ed5-41c3ea04abb1.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Then I increase dataset (~1900 images) and got different issues mentioned below at each time run turicreate python script
It keeps on loading for long time (~1 to 2 hours )

&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5689804/41145586-3b453b6c-6b1e-11e8-9a0c-347451916d3d.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Summary :
Area:

Expected Results: It will create coreML model at the completion of turicreate training process.
Actual Results: Turicreate training is not proceed forward after few iterations(say 91 iteration)
Version/Build: Turi version 4.3.2 (stable version)

 Really sorry you are having so many issues. I think I spot two distinct issues that I can guess the cause for:

It seems to fail shuffling your SFrame, which we know has high memory overhead (#608). In that other issue, did you try turning off shuffling? Did it help?
It looks like you might be running out of memory training on the GPU. Do you know how many GB of memory your GPU has? You can check this with nvidia-smi. Right now, I believe we require 4 GB, but we do not check this explicitly so that we can handle it more gracefully (we should). Ideally, we should automatically re-configure the batch size to make it fit. For now, you can try things like create(..., _advanced_parameters={'batch_size': 8}) (the default is 32, try lowering until errors disappear), but we can't guarantee the max iteration selection will be appropriate in this case.

 thanks ! I have checked GPU memory using watch nvidia- smi command. It created python process and memory percent increase and decrease for sometime. After that it utilizes CPU process with memory less than 50 %. As of now I can able to create model with less accuracy without any issue by disable shuffle option in create function.

		if we disable shuffle option as false, it will created coreML model, but it is not accurate and detect all the objects when compared to model created with shuffle option as true.
If we enable shuffle option, still we get same memory error mentioned below

  (GPU) Based on my observation turicreate trained  dataset up to 1094 images and can create coreML model, if we train more than that, it return memory error
Do you have any update on this issue ?

 We are looking into this, but it doesn't have a quick fix so it might take some time until we roll out a fix. Apologies for this!

 Do we have a repro for this?

 Not yet. I have tried with an ubuntu VM where I could control and reduce RAM. I still could not repro this even with only 2 GB RAM and a large SFrame.

		I faced the similar issue while training for ~7k images. After analysing I found that there was a mismatch of the class labels provided during training with the labels in data set that was present in .csv file which I used for creating sframe. After fixing the label in dataset I recreated sframe and it worked for me.

 That's interesting - thanks for reporting this! I'm not sure why mismatching the labels would lead to a memory failure like this. So, the only difference between the two datasets was that one had effectively random labels and the other one had correct ones? Were there any other changes?

 Could you clarify what you mean by
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;mismatch of the class labels provided during training with the labels in data set that was present in .csv file
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We are still trying to repro this issue.

 Just as an update, we still haven't been able to repro this specific issue. We did repro &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/608&gt;#608&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and fixed it with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/904&gt;#904&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which is now merged into master.
This issue looks very similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/608&gt;#608&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from the logs and we think it may be fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/904&gt;#904&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Could you try building Turi Create from master to verify that? We also plan to release Turi Create 5.0beta3 soon so if you want to wait for the Turi Create wheel, that works too!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dhgokul&gt;@dhgokul&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ,
We just released Turi Create 5.0 beta 3, you can find the wheels on the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/releases&gt;release page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. We think this should be fixed now but please let us know if you can still repro the issue and we'll reopen it!
