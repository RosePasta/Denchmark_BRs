	<summary>libRecommender should have a single dylib for all platforms</summary>
	<description>
Related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/799&gt;#799&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/822&gt;#822&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
: the reason we renamed the dylibs (which breaks runtime loading, apparently) was because we have multiple architectures (x86_64 and arm64), in separate files. The right way to do this is instead to use bitcode, and/or a "fat" binary, containing all the necessary code for multiple architectures. This would allow users to share a single .dylib across iOS, macOS, and hopefully also iOS simulator.

		We should look into whether we can build in &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31486232/how-do-i-xcodebuild-a-static-library-with-bitcode-enabled&gt;bitcode&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If not, we may be able to build each platform we want to support into the same dylib explicitly.

 Is this now fixed? It got auto-resolved with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2835&gt;#2835&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 but it sounds from your comment like more work may be needed here.
