	<summary>Bools rendered as Ints in accordion</summary>
	<description>
True and False are rendered as 1 and 0 respectively on the accordion in data.explore()
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;a = [True, True, False, False, True]
b = ["hello", "it's", "me", "i", "was"]
c = [9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
d = ["wondering", "if", "after", "all", "these", "years?"]
e = ["hello", "from", "the", "other side"]
f = [True]
g = [False]
h = [3.14156197823, 2.7165727, 9.801893812, 78213, 908.0]
we_are_one = tc.SArray([a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h])
we_are_one.explore()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Actual:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14062641/38649429-632d8530-3dab-11e8-82d2-fcf3efe482d4.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Expected:
True instead of 1, False instead of 0, in the first, sixth, and the seventh columns.

		By Design - we don't actually have a boolean type in SFrame, so upon ingestion into an SArray, the True/False values are represented ints (0/1).
