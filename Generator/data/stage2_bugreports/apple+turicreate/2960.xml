 - can you share more details? Sounds like you're using Linux and GPUs. What version of Linux? What version of Python are you using? Are you able to share the dataset? If not, approximately how large is your dataset?

		Does the segmentation fault happen all the time or is it intermittent? Are you using a fresh virtual environment just for TuriCreate, or have you installed other python packages (ex: TensorFlow) in the same python environment?

  We tried in both venv by install as fresh turicreate version and upgrade exiting turicreate version from 5.8 to 6.0. we got this issue

		TuriCreate 6.0 now uses TensorFlow for deep learning. I would assume that when you install TuriCreate, TensorFlow 2.1 gets installed, but please check which version of TensorFlow gets installed. Then see if you have the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu&gt;right versions of cuDNN and CUDA installed for your version of TensorFlow&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.

 Thanks! will check and update you .Object detection will use darknet yolo or tensorflow model in turicreate 6.0?

 - Internally TuriCreate's object detection toolkit uses a TensorFlow implementation of darknet-yolo.

@TobyRoseman Thanks! any performance improvement in latest turicreate 6.0 object detection ?

I don't believe we saw a significant improvements (or regressions) from TuriCreate 5.8 to 6.0 for object detection.

		This is likely the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/3003&gt;#3003&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We have identified an issue with the Object Detector when TensorFlow 2.1 is installed. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/3003&gt;#3003&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for details.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dhgokul&gt;@dhgokul&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - What version of TensorFlow are you using?

 - I haven't heard back from you, so I'm going to close this issue. I strongly suspect this is the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/3003&gt;#3003&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please reopen this issue if you are in fact using TensorFlow 2.0.0 or 2.0.1 in your environment.
