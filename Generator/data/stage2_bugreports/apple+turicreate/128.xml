		Thanks for trying out turicreate and sorry for the trouble. Unfortunately, that was a typo in our documentation. I'll keep this up until we fix the documentation.
We have a bug in our S3 reader for certain regions which got handled in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/57&gt;#57&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. So you might have to wait for the point release (which should happen soon) to get the fix in to use S3 reliably with good documentation too.

		This is a duplicate of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/57&gt;#57&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, which is tracking updating the documentation for setting AWS credentials. The code fix to make buckets work (once credentials are set) has gone in already and will come out in the next release.
