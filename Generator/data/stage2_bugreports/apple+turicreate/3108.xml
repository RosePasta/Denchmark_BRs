	<summary>Saving to S3 assume key prefix already exists</summary>
	<description>
If I try to save an SFrame doing this sf.save('s3://my-bucket/myFolder/mySFrameName'), that will only work if the key prefix "myFolder/mySFrameName" already exists in my bucket.
The best behavior here isn't clear to me, but certainly the current behavior is not right. If only s3://my-bucket/myFolder/ exists than it should still have the SFrame.
I think we may want to be even more accepting, but I'm not sure. I think if the myFolder key prefix doesn't even exist, we should still save it to 's3://my-bucket/myFolder/mySFrameName'. Do other people have thoughts here?

		Yeas, for your case here, myFolder must exist.
