	<summary>Each iteration took different amount of time depending on `max_iterations` in Style Transfer</summary>
	<description>
I trained a style transfer model with one content and one style.
Without setting max_iterations(or explicitly setting as 5000), it took about 30s per each iteration.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Using 'image' in style_dataset as feature column and using 'image' in content_dataset as feature column
Setting max_iterations to be 5000
Using CPU to create model
Analyzing visual features of the style images
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| Iteration    | Loss         | Elapsed Time |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| 1            | 8.172        | 8.7          |
| 2            | 8.166        | 36.1         |
| 3            | 8.154        | 64.3         |
| 4            | 8.137        | 95.4         |
| 5            | 8.116        | 124.8        |
| 6            | 8.091        | 152.9        |
| 7            | 8.063        | 181.7        |
| 8            | 8.032        | 210.8        |
| 9            | 7.999        | 238.2        |
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, when I set it as 5, the first iteration took 30s, and I couldn't get a response of the second iteration for 10 minutes. (I stopped the run after then.)
model = tc.style_transfer.create(styles, content, max_iterations=5 ) # 2:43PM
# No response @ 2:53PM
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Using 'image' in style_dataset as feature column and using 'image' in content_dataset as feature column

| Iteration    | Loss         | Elapsed Time |

| 1            | 8.172        | 31.4         |
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I think the user usually set the max_interaction to control the amount of time to train with expecting the same (similar) amount of time per iteration. The attached is the images I used for the style and the content.
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Content&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Style&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

		I met the same problem as you, after testing, I believe that it is because the function tc.style_transfer.create() has no parameter of max iterations,or not the same order. But I have no answer now.

		You need to have more contents images, minimum 4, I think.
Similar "bug" I was experiencing:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/636&gt;#636&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

PS: I still cannot get style that is more VGG, too much Resnet at the moment...
