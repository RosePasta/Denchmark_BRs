	<summary>mxnet &amp;lt; 1.4.0 brings in an unsupported requests version</summary>
	<description>
Current mxnet versions (prior to 1.4) bring in a version of requests that is unsupported and has reported vulnerabilities. We should upgrade our max dependency to 1.4.0 to fix this.

		We should also take out the requests dependency that the coremltools source drop brought in. This one is not even used anywhere.
