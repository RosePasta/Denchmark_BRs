	<summary>object detector presenting errors</summary>
	<description>
Hi guys, I've been getting this error when I run my training script after updating. The code hasn't changed at all. The only thing that's different is the update to Turi create.
here's the error that I got:
File "train.py", line 16, in

I looked at the documentation and I noticed the train_data property wasn't anywhere in the create method for the object detector. Did you guys deprecate it in 5.0?
Thanks

		train_data is an SFrame. Its part of your data.  Can you share the MXNet version that you have?

		I have MXNet 1.0.1
I get this error message every time I try to clean install Turi Create:
mxnet 1.1.0.post0 has requirement numpy&lt;1.15.0,&gt;=1.8.2, but you'll have numpy 1.15.1 which is incompatible.
mxnet 1.1.0.post0 has requirement requests&lt;2.19.0,&gt;=2.18.4, but you'll have requests 2.19.1 which is incompatible.

 We no longer support MXNet 1.0.1 with Turi Create 5.0. As of 5.0, you'll need . See &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/src/unity/python/setup.py#L181&gt;https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/src/unity/python/setup.py#L181&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Please reopen this issue if you are able to repro with an MXNet version in that range. Note that the warnings you're getting about required/compatible versions of numpy and requests can probably be safely ignored; both Turi Create and MXNet are likely to still work in that case.

 it's happening again with mxnet==1.1.0.post0

		Reopening as this now seems to repro with a supported mxnet version.

		Are you still encountering this error? It looks like it might be a corrupted MXNet params file. By now, the locally downloaded copy of the pre-trained model has probably been deleted, but if necessary we can clear it out to force a fresh download

		This is ultimately an MXNet issue. Since we no longer use MXNet, I'm going to close this issue.
