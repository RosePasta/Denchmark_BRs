	<summary>SArray.show() is not working in Jupyter Notebook</summary>
	<description>
Here is my code in Jupyter Notebook
import turicreate as tc
products = tc.SFrame('amazon_baby.gl')
products['name'].show()
Above code shows nothing but a string ''Materializing SArray''
products.show() is working fine.

		Thanks @The-Code-Killer for reporting this. I was able to reproduce the issue.
Here is a more minimalistic way to reproduce the issue:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import turicreate as tc

sa = tc.SArray(["&amp;quot;Firsts&amp;quot;"])
sa.show()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We'll look in to it.
