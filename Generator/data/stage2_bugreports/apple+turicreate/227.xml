	<summary>csv header parsing problem with BOM UTF8</summary>
	<description>
I'm using Python 2.7.13 with turicreate version 4.0 shown by "pip show turicreate".
To recreate the bug,


Write character 'a' to "buggy.csv" in UTF-8 encoding.


Run the following code:
import turicreate as tc data1 = tc.SFrame('buggy.csv') print data1['a'] 


Expected output:
[]
Actual output:
RuntimeError: Column name a does not exist.
I used a debugger and found that the corresponding column in data1 for 'a' is '\xef\xbb\xbfa', which means that the BOM is incorrectly parsed as header.

 - Does it work if you do: ? This is the intended way to read CSV files.
What you're doing should probably give an error. I'll take a look at that. Please attach buggy.csv to this issue.

 result is the same
You can remove the ".txt" for the csv file.

		Good find. Interestingly, the column name is parsed incorrectly
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [13]: data1
Out[13]:
Columns:
	a	str

Rows: 0

Data:
	[]

In [14]: data1.column_names()
Out[14]: ['\xef\xbb\xbfa']
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We'll investigate
