	<summary>libRecommender in release bundle is labeled as x86_64 but seems to be compiled for arm64</summary>
	<description>
I'm building a Mac app with a recommender model. But the libRecommender downloaded from the release section (release 6.1) doesn't seem to include a proper x86_64 binary.
The build log is showing that the compiler is ignoring the linking:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1548127/77848773-86aaea00-71c7-11ea-897c-f4eadf06a571.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Lipo output of the framework binary:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1548127/77848790-9e826e00-71c7-11ea-9376-0306a55dd4b0.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

The symptoms are same as in this issue: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2148&gt;#2148&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 - I've confirmed this issue. Sorry about this. It's my fault. I must have mixed up the x86_64 and arm64 files that are named the same thing when I was packaging the  release artifact. This issue is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/3004&gt;#3004&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
; we need to automate this release process in order to prevent these types of errors.
Here is a recent &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/files/4405998/artifacts.zip&gt;artifacts.zip&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 generated from master. It contains the x86_64 dylibs for both the Recommender and the Sound Classifier

 - thanks again for pointing out this issue. This has been fixed in our last two releases. I'm going to close this issue.
