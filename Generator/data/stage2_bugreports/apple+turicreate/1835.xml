	<summary>Process crash with wrong flexible_type::get&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</summary>
	<description>
Repro steps:

Use the C API to call a function that expects (i.e.) an SArray of dicts, and pass in an SArray of string.

Expected:
An exception is thrown from C++, goes through the C API mechanism of error handling, and the function populates the tc_error pointer and returns.
Actual:
In debug:
The assert(false) is hit, and takes down the process immediately.
In release:
Weird and bad things happen because of an unsafe reinterpret_cast. Likely to crash in the immediate future after the assertion would've happened in debug.
Discussed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hoytak&gt;@hoytak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, and we think the perf hit from potentially throwing on .get won't be too bad (and in the places where profiling says it's a perf hit, we should either plumb through an  separately, or refactor to avoid calling  in a tight loop).
