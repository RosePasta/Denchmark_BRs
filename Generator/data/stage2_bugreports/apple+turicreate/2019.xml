	<summary>One-shot OD hangs for 5+ minutes while preparing augmented data</summary>
	<description>
The one-shot OD toolkit gives no user output while doing augmentation; this can take at least 5 minutes, and up to about an hour. During this process, there is no indication anything is happening and the Python prompt appears to have hung.
We should use a table_printer with progress to give progress output here.
