	<summary>Wrong git SHA in egg/wheel</summary>
	<description>
tc.version_info.git_sha seems wrong.
In [1]: import turicreate as tc

In [2]: tc.version_info.version
Out[2]: '4.1'

In [3]: tc.version_info.git_sha
Out[3]: '54b25133c1d8b8d84e2e580f546a23348f3c6796'
However that doesn't seem to even be a commit in this repository:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/commit/54b25133c1d8b8d84e2e580f546a23348f3c6796&gt;54b2513&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I would expect it to match the SHA listed here (): &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/releases/tag/v4.1&gt;https://github.com/apple/turicreate/releases/tag/v4.1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Hmm, thanks for checking on this. Looks like our build system logic around git sha is a bit messed up.
