	<summary>Performance Issues in TC5  xgboost</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
We've (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/guyinbar&gt;@guyinbar&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 and I) noticed performance degradation in the TC5 versions.
You can run the zipped Python script under multiple environments using tox, and you'll see it too. On 1M rows the differences are ~10s in TC4, 20s in all TC5 variants. But this is not a matter of import times, etc - when you raise the number of rows/columns you'll see more clear differences.
