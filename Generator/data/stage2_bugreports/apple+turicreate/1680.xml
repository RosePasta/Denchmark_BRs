	<summary>Configure still checks for OpenMP; resulting Linux builds require it</summary>
	<description>
There is a legacy dependency on OpenMP, which ./configure &amp; cmake still check for. As a result, we end up with a dynamic link dependency on Linux for libgomp1, if it was present at build time, even though we don't seem to be using it.
We should remove the build time checks and dynamic linking.

		Seems the check and the requirement are coming from two different places (unrelated):

CMakeLists.txt prints out that it's checking, but doesn't actually check for or link against OpenMP.
At runtime, import mxnet on Linux depends on OpenMP, and we depend on mxnet.

 - It looks like the erroneous CMakeList.txt print statements has been removed; at least I can't find it. Given that we no longer depend on mxnet, can this issue be closed?
