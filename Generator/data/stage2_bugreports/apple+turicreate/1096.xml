	<summary>Tuples get parsed as arrays which are unhashable</summary>
	<description>
Right now, even if I have an SArray of dictionaries with tuple keys, displaying it doesn't work because tuples automatically get interpreted as arrays. This is calamitous because arrays are not a hashable type. Furthermore, if I try to save/create/explore this SArray/SFrame, I don't get any errors but the data structure is pretty unusable.
I think the true solution to this would be to support tuple types in Turi Create.
Minimal Repro:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;d = {(0,0):"lol"}  
arr = [d]
sa = tc.SArray(arr) # works
sa.save("no_error.sarray") # works
sa.explore() # works
print(sa[0]) # uh oh
print(sa) # uh oh
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Tuple types are supported; the C++ types don't match up one-to-one to the python types, so the main solution to this seems to be to have the translation from C++ into python depend somewhat on the context.
