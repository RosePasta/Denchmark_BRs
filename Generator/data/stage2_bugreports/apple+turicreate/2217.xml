	<summary>oneshot detector segmentation fault or kernel dies</summary>
	<description>
Model creation fails if tested on more than a few images. Tried macOS (16 GB RAM), CentOS 9 (28 GB RAM), Ubuntu 18 and 19 (28 GB RAM), but I always get Segmentation fault or kernel killed; tried a combination of python 2.7 and 3.6, same result. I run it against 10-30 images. Sometimes memory usage is high, sometimes not. Tried it with different image sets. Example image set: &lt;denchmark-link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jq8XD1N48YeBF6OxCYPoi4H3_g2e6v0f&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jq8XD1N48YeBF6OxCYPoi4H3_g2e6v0f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Turicreate is 5.6 (current master).
Code is:
python
import turicreate as tc
starter_images = tc.load_images('./')
starter_images['label'] = starter_images['path'].element_slice(2,-4)
model = tc.one_shot_object_detector.create(starter_images,'label')

		This seems to be a dupe of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2038&gt;#2038&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. At the very least, we should see if the fix for that issue resolves this one.

 - &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2038&gt;#2038&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 is still open. So there isn't a fix yet. This issue was closed as a duplicate. Please subscribe to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2038&gt;#2038&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
