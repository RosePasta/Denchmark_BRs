	<summary>Going to the last row followed by trying to go to row 0 causes an infinite scroll from 0 downward</summary>
	<description>
On macOS High Sierra in the Debug build.
Repro: In the cats and dogs dataset, there are 24769 rows (0-indexed). When I try to go to row number 24769 (which doesn't exist), it takes me to row number 24712 (Known issue filed as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/461&gt;#461&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ).  Repro attached for text in bold. Note that the repro was infinite, but I only recorded the first few seconds.
