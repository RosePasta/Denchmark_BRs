	<summary>Unclear error message in apply method when most values are None</summary>
	<description>
When all rows used by the apply method for type inference return None, then the resulting SArray defaults to float.  I know this can be solved by specifying dtype but the error message should be clearer, especially when considering lazy operations.
Running:
import turicreate as tc
a = tc.SArray(list(range(100000)))
b = a.apply(lambda x: None if x &lt; 1000 else str(x))
b.materialize()
Results in:
TypeError: Cannot convert 41666 to float
I suggest something along the lines of TypeError: Cannot convert 41666 of type XXXX to float which is the type of the SArray. If this is not the correct type try specifying it during creation
