	<summary>Empty strings showing up oddly in sketch summaries</summary>
	<description>
Observed Behavior:
The Most frequent items table printed by SArray.sketch_summary() for a string-type SArray will include an odd column name (Xn) if one of the values is an empty string. The reason is probably that it couldn’t use an empty string for a column name when unpacking the freq_count, but this is very confusing.



import turicreate as tc;tc.SArray(["a", "b", ""]).sketch_summary()
+------------------+-------+----------+
|       item       | value | is exact |
+------------------+-------+----------+
|      Length      |   3   |   Yes    |
| # Missing Values |   0   |   Yes    |
| # unique values  |   3   |    No    |
+------------------+-------+----------+



Most frequent items:
+-------+---+----+---+
| value | a | X3 | b |
+-------+---+----+---+
| count | 1 | 1  | 1 |
+-------+---+----+---+
Expected Behavior:
Use some sense-making name for an empty string. Usually an empty string means something as bad as a None so it deserves special treatment. Definitely don’t output X6, X7… etc as it confuses users.
Steps To Reproduce:
import turicreate as tc;tc.SArray(["a", "b", ""]).sketch_summary()

		This should be printed differently. Column names shouldn't be used to represent values; we should have something more like:
&lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Value | Count&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

""       |  1
"a"     |  1
"b"     |  1
