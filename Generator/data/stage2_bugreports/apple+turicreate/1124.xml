		Never seen this issue. Have you tried to run it on Python 3.6? Could be that this doesn't help, but, if it's easy for you to switch could worth a try.

		Can you share the PNG that caused the issue. I suspect it might be a grayscale image.

		Based on the backtrace, this is a dupe of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/1046&gt;#1046&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, caused either by a RGBA PNG image or a CMYK JPEG. With the fix for that bug, we'll convert 4-channel PNG appropriately, but libjpeg doesn't support CMYK -&gt; RGB
