	<summary>Reading CSV: newlines in quoted text should be ignored</summary>
	<description>
Reading the following CSV will result in an error:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;id,title
11,"this is fine"
12,this is also fine
13,"this is 
not fine!"
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Also the title value for the last row will be just this is.
Expected result: no error and the final title value is this is\nnot fine!.
