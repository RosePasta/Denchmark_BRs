		The value of max_iterations that you passed was 0 or None?

		I was not using anything. Sorry, I should have made a clear repro step in the original bug report as I am unable to repro it now on current master. This may have been fixed. If you can verify that default and 0 both works on current master then please close this issue.

		It works for me for default and 0. It does not work when you pass None. I think it breaks appropriately as it can only take int as input (mentioned in API docs). Hence, I am closing this issue.
