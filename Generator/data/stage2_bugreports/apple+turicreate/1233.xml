	<summary>Unclear error message when calculating jaccard and weighted_jaccard distance</summary>
	<description>
For both jaccard and weighted_jaccard distances the following produces an unclear error:
a = {'k': 'df'}
b = {'j': 1}
tc.toolkits.distances.jaccard(a, b)
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ToolkitError: stod: no conversion
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I would expect something similar to:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ToolkitError: at least one of the dictionary values could not be converted to a number.
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

This is especially confusing when using jaccard distance which does not consider the values of the dictionary.
