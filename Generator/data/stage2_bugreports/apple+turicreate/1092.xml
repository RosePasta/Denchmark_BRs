User guide page: &lt;denchmark-link:https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/supervised-learning/regression.html&gt;https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/supervised-learning/regression.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

“The following figure depicts a sample supervised learning model where the training data (depicted in blue) is used to learn a function (depicted in pink) which can then be used in the future to make predictions.”
No figure on page

Figure to be present on page.
Figure properly appears on old user guide version: &lt;denchmark-link:https://turi.com/learn/userguide/supervised-learning/regression.html&gt;https://turi.com/learn/userguide/supervised-learning/regression.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		I believe the root cause of this is that we're not loading the  library which prevents us from drawing the charts. After research into the way Gitbook builds projects from the Markdown source, I can't find a simple way to include something like . &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/znation&gt;@znation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hoytak&gt;@hoytak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 do you know if I can get access to the git repo at the old &lt;denchmark-link:https://turi.com/learn/userguide/supervised-learning/linear-regression.html&gt;Turi site&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to check how we're building it there?
