 - I'm not able to reproduce this issue. When I run  in a virtual environment, I am able to successfully .
This looks like the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/634&gt;#634&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 which was fixed in 5.0b2. So I would expected you to get this error if you are using 5.0b1 but not 5.0b2.
Please verify that you are using 5.0b2 by running: . Also I would recommend using a virtual environment, as mention in the Installation Section of our &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate&gt;README&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
If this doesn't resolve your issue, please let us know what operating system version you are using.

		I am using
macOS Sierra 10.12.6 with all security updates
Xcode 9.2 with command line tools installed
Python 2.7.10
pip 10.0.1
turicreate==5.0b2
coremltools==2.0b1
Should I upgrade to macOS High Sierra in order to use turicreate ?

 I'll take a look. Upgrading is likely to fix the issue for now, but Turi Create is intended to still run on 10.12 in 5.0. The code that built the 5.0b2 release should work in 10.12, but something may have gone wrong in building or packaging that results in errors when using it in 10.12.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/javacom&gt;@javacom&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I've confirmed on my machine with macOS 10.12.6 with all the latest updates, that  does fix the issue. Please confirm that you're importing turicreate from the correct environment, and that you have 5.0b2 installed; if you are still able to repro this with 5.0b2, please reactivate this issue, thanks!
