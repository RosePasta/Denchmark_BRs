	<summary>recommender model.export should explain TCRecommender dependency</summary>
	<description>
Repro steps:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;# make a recommender model with tc.recommender.create on some data
model.export_coreml('my_model.mlmodel')
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Expected:
Some explanatory text/warning is printed out, explaining that there is a dylib dependency needed for Core ML integration, and where to get it.
Actual:
No additional help text is printed; the user is on their own to figure out that they need this additional dependency.
