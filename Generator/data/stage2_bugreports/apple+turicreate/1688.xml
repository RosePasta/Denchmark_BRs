	<summary>load_audio(...) should always glob path input</summary>
	<description>
If you are in a directory with wav files, load_audio('.') will correctly load the audio files. However doing load_audio('./*') will not load any of the audio files.

		What does load_images do with file globs?

		Surprisingly (at least to me) load_image doesn't seem to support file globs at all. For consistency load_audio and load_images should behave the same. Does anyone have a strong opinion about if we should support file globs or not in load_image and load_audio?

		Well, file globs, like ~, aren't a file system thing, they're a shell thing. As such, they're not very portable. In general, our C++ APIs don't support these things. For ~, we've manually inserted the conversion at the Python/C boundary, IIRC.
So we should try to be consistent with how the rest of the package uses these things, really. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hoytak&gt;@hoytak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 Do you have additional context? (Corrections on my understanding above?)
