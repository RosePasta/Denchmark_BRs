	<summary>draw_bounding_boxes can give different colors for the same label</summary>
	<description>
Right now, colors are based on hash values, so that a string label will always be associated with the same color, regardless of what other classes are in a dataset.
I have noticed this not working. I don't think the hash function is reliable for this. It also different between Python 2 and 3. This can be replaced with a simpler and consistently working hash function.

		This seems to be a Python 3 issue, where hash gives different values depending on the Python session (this also affects apply).
