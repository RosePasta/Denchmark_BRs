	<summary>Weird error message on SFrame.read_csv with HTTP 404: Not implemented: compiled without support for http(s):// URLs.</summary>
	<description>
When a URL gives a 404 response, the error message from SFrame does not make sense, and refers to being compiled without networking support (this is not the case). With Turi Create 5.4:
import turicreate as tc

# This URL loads correctly
sf = tc.SFrame.read_csv('https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/turicreate/datasets/tc-clang-format-results.csv')

# Change the suffix to ".404.csv" -- this URL gives the following error:
sf = tc.SFrame.read_csv('https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/turicreate/datasets/tc-clang-format-results.404.csv')

IOError: Cannot open https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/turicreate/datasets/tc-clang-format-results.bad.csv for read. Not implemented: compiled without support for http(s):// URLs.

 Thanks for volunteering to fix this! I think it may already be fixed in latest master, so try to repro it first.
