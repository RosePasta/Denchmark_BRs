	<summary>Core ML: Predicted feature named '___' was not output by pipeline</summary>
	<description>
I successfully exported a Boosted Trees Classifier model to a Core ML model and imported it into a Xcode project. All seemed well until I tried using it in Swift. Whenever I run the predict function (even with valid inputs) I receive an error: "Predicted feature named 'room' was not output by pipeline" where room is my target name. Is this a Core ML issue or did I export it wrong from Turi Create?
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sf = tc.SFrame.read_csv('all.csv')
model = tc.boosted_trees_classifier.create(sf, target='room')
model.export_coreml("Model.mlmodel")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

For context, the top 10 lines of the SFrame:

 Could you please provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue? I tried with the following steps, with synthetic data based on what you pasted above: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/files/1549403/repro.txt&gt;repro.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

# Create the model
import turicreate as tc
sf = tc.SFrame.read_csv('repro.txt')
model = tc.boosted_trees_classifier.create(sf, target='room')
model.export_coreml("Model.mlmodel")
# Make predictions
import coremltools
model = coremltools.models.MLModel('Model.mlmodel')
model.predict({'b1': 1, 'b2': 2, 'b3': 3, 'b4': 4, 'b5': 5})
Gives output with no error:
{u'room': 3L, u'roomProbability': {3L: 0.5, 4L: 0.5}}

		Oh, Python is not the problem. Running it with coremltools works fine, but importing into an Xcode project is where it fails to predict

		Interesting. Let me see if I can repro the issue there.

 I'm still unable to repro. In Swift in Xcode, I tried the following:
let model = Model()
let output = try! model.prediction(b1: 1, b2: 3, b3: 43, b4: 2, b5: 10)
dump(output)
And it gives me:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;▿ repro.ModelOutput #0
  - room: 3
  ▿ roomProbability: 2 key/value pairs
    ▿ (2 elements)
      - key: 3
      - value: 0.5
    ▿ (2 elements)
      - key: 4
      - value: 0.5
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

What version of Xcode are you using, and what version of macOS are you running? It's possible this bug is specific to a particular version.

		I am on 10.13.2 using Xcode 9.2. I tried using your repro.txt and it worked just fine, but using the same code but with the expanded dataset I again encountered the error. Any reason you rounded the numbers in repro.txt?

 Interesting, I see! Not sure when or how the numbers got rounded (somewhere in copy/paste the way I made a CSV) but I doubt that would affect it. Can you by any chance share your full training data (or a subset of it that also results in the same issue), in CSV format, as a  file here so I can reproduce the issue? Thanks!

, I'm able to reproduce the issue with the model trained on . I'm not sure yet what the cause is but I'm able to see that this model gives predictions in Python but gives errors when called from Swift. I'll investigate further.

		I might be confused, but after upgrading to 4.1, regenerating the mlmodel, and replacing it in my project, I am still experiencing the same error:
&lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2834973/36001667-14ce8880-0cf5-11e8-8004-ebc78c9339bc.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/johnlev&gt;@johnlev&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, looks like this did not in fact get fixed in 4.1. Sorry for the miscommunication. I'll reopen and we'll make sure the fix gets into 4.2.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/znation&gt;@znation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Looking forward to using Turicreate in my project once this is done

 We have traced down the bug to the presence of a byte-ordered mark in your file. This is corrupting the read_csv of SFrame resulting in columns that contain non-ascii characters
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;sf.column_names()
['\xef\xbb\xbfb1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'room']
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

The simplest work around is for you to remove the marker from the file which you can do with a simple sed script.
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;awk 'NR==1{sub(/^\xef\xbb\xbf/,"")}1' all2.txt &gt; all2_byte_ordered.txt
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

We will be fixing the underlying issue in  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/227&gt;#227&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Hopefully that should unblock you to use Turi Create in your application.
