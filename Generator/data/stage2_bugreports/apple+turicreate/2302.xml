	<summary>libbz2.so.1.0 missing?</summary>
	<description>
Since 5.7, I've been getting the following on my OracleLinux 6.9 (kinda like Centos) machines:
ImportError: libbz2.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
 shows me that  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/bzip2-devel-1.0.6-13.el7.x86_64.rpm.html&gt;the relevant library&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) is installed, yet this still happens.
Perhaps this is related to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2097&gt;#2097&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , which somehow made  no longer statically compile with the rest of ? (a tip I got from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hoytak&gt;@hoytak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
!)

		This should be fixed with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2835&gt;#2835&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.  A quick test shows that:
On OSX, otool -L *.dylib | grep bz2 finds no dependency on bz2.
On Linux, the same with ldd also finds no dependency on bz2.
(In addition, it appears this was caused by installing libbz2-dev on some of the build machines, which is no longer the case.)
