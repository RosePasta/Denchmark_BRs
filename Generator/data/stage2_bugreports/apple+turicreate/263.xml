	<summary>Make sure wheels reflect macOS versions that are supported</summary>
	<description>
Right now wheels suggest that Turi Create supports macOS 10.5+, which will cause pip to try to install Turi Create on those versions. However, it only support 10.12+ and that should ideally be reflected in the wheels.

		Closing. Looks like this hasn't been an issue since 4.2 (as of 4.3, we are specifying 10.12 as the minimum OS version in the package name).
