		Only item similarity models can actually even do recommend_from_interactions, which is the API we expose in Core ML. Other types of recommender models rely on recommending to specific identified users, which doesn't really fit the Core ML deployment paradigm (new users, or those whose data aren't stored directly within the model, won't get any better recommendations than by looking at popularity).
For the other types of recommenders, we should update the error message given on export_coreml, and fix the bad formatting that it's currently giving:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;ToolkitError: factorization_recommenderExporting to Core ML is not currently supported by
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
