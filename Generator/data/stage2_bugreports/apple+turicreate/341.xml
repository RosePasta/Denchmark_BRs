	<summary>Seems to require numexpr==2.6.4</summary>
	<description>
I install turicreate under python=3.5 and while 'import turicreate' it keep reporting that ImportError /lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.21 not found, but I have installed 'GLIBCXX_3.4.21', after tried a lot ways I found the solution is just upgrade the numexpr to version 2.6.4 pip install 'numexpr==2.6.4', then the problem disappeared.

		Thanks for reporting this. We'll look into it and upgrade our instructions accordingly.

		The symptom shown, , seems to be what is expected on older Linux distributions that don't meet our minimum requirement for libstdc++ (which provides the GLIBCXX version symbols). See the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/LINUX_INSTALL.md#ubuntu--1404&gt;Ubuntu 14.04 installation instructions&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for more details on the expected resolution.
I'm not sure how upgrading numexpr (which as far as I can tell, we have no dependency on or relationship with) can affect this. I'm going to close this issue as I expect it's resolved by the Linux installation instructions linked above, but please reopen if there are consistent repro steps and/or you do find a clear link between numexpr and libstdc++.
