	<summary>one shot object detector seems unusable on an iMac with 24GB!</summary>
	<description>
training starts after 30min without the time measured for downloading background data.
Annotation uses all the ram and afterwards, my iMac is swapping for about 30 minutes before training starts.
Training time seems to be like 8 hours for my 12 test classes - which is in the range of expectations.
-- hmm maybe not - cpu and gnu usage is nearly non existing during the training - while hd io is high.
update: training speed is nearly non existing due to heavy hd io.....
Maybe you should not test turicreate only on iMac Pros with 64 GB of ram.
