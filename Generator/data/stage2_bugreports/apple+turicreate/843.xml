	<summary>libTuriCreate.dylib does not contain the right symbols.</summary>
	<description>
After running build_capi.sh, it does not look like the right symbols are being exported in libTuriCreate.dylib or in the framework. For example, the following command finds nothing:  nm target/capi/libTuriCreate.dylib | grep -i sarray. Looking at nm target/capi/libTuriCreate.dylib seems it's missing pretty much all of the symbols.

		This was an issue as far back as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/commit/f3c5ea1a13db7a40fb4491e6ae329fb14af2a8c2&gt;f3c5ea1&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

It was working in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/commit/acd1422e82e4dabd6da7a3f82771dbf2f0474b1b&gt;acd1422&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Assigning to you per our conversation - let me know if the shared-from-static approach doesn't seem to work.
