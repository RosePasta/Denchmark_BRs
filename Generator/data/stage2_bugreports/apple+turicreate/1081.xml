	<summary>Potential CoreML export error on watchOS 4</summary>
	<description>
From &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/1016&gt;#1016&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I would like to chime in here. I have a turicreate model in production (via conversion to CoreML) on the App Store, and it works fine on iOS 11 / watchOS 4 and older devices.
However, the same models do not work on iOS 12 / watchOS 5 devices. My model is an LSTM that predicts activities based on accelerometer in the Apple Watch, and when I run the app in the latest Xcode on a watchOS 5 device, the output is constantly bogus and makes no sense (my hand is still yet it predicts I am doing an activity that requires a lot of motion).
The same exact model with the same exact build of the app works fine on my watchOS 4 device. I am certain this is a model conversion issue.

		Is there any way I can share my model with you via email? Don't really want to make it public for competitive reasons.

		I have confirmed that there is no issue in the export. Still waiting to confirm what the issue is with CoreML. I'll close this issue if its a CoreML issue.

		Identified to be an issue not related to CoreML.
