	<summary>Object detection should give a better error message when it fails on &amp;lt;10.14</summary>
	<description>
A macOS version check seems to missing in the detector's export_coreml that will make sure it isn't trying to save a NMS model with macOS older than 10.14.
We should error out and offer the following suggestions:

Upgrade to 10.14
Add include_non_maximum_suppression=False

We could also automatically fall back to the latter and write a warning, but I don't think I like that option as much.

 I agree with the error message and suggestion of the 2 things.

 This issue doesn't quite make sense to me. Shouldn't we be able to export with NMS, even on 10.12 or 10.13, or Linux, so long as the runtime target is macOS 10.14+ or iOS  12+?
Also, isn't this really the same issue as &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/701&gt;#701&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ?
