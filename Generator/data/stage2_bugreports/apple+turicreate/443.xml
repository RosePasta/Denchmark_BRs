	<summary>Explore scrolling jumps around</summary>
	<description>
As I scroll down (and hit the bottom):

First, the scrollbar hits bottom and the last visible row (99) appears at the bottom. This seems fine.
A half second or so later, the scrollbar jumps (which is fine), and the rows jump (row 99 is now up a couple from where it was) - this part seems like a bug.
Briefly in between, it jumps to about row 138 (then back to 91). This also seems like a bug.

See video for repro:
