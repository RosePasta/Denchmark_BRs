	<summary>tc.config.set_runtime_config should error if given bad alternative SSL cert path</summary>
	<description>
The following code completes without error even though the file doesn't exist.
 import turicreate as tc                                                                                                                                                                                                               

tc.config.set_runtime_config("TURI_FILEIO_ALTERNATIVE_SSL_CERT_FILE",
    "/this_file_does_not_exist")                                                                
Expected: it should provide a helpful error message about the file not existing.

		This same code also does not expand ~ and does not work with relative paths.

		Hi Toby,
I would like to work on this bug. Do you want the code to work if the user provides a path with ~ or a relative path? Or should the user get an appropriate error message?

 - Thanks for your interest in fixing this issue. I've assigned this issue to you.
Ideally it should work if the user uses a ~. However I'm fine if we want to make that a seperate issue.

 Thank you! I am interested in contributing more but I am having trouble figuring out which issue to contribute to next. I would like to stick to Python though. Do you have recommendations?

 - Although not ideal, it's probably a good idea to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&gt;look at issues which are tagged as "good first issue"&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Either &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2697&gt;#2697&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/1688&gt;#1688&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 might be good choices for you.
