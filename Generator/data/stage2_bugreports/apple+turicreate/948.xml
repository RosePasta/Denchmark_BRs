		I've seen this warning before and I don't believe it's anything to worry about. However we should investigate and hopefully stop what is causing the warning.
I believe this is a Python 3 only issue. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Digital-Rabbit&gt;@Digital-Rabbit&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - what version of Python you are using?

		Looks like this is due to &lt;denchmark-link:https://bugs.python.org/issue27364&gt;https://bugs.python.org/issue27364&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. I'm guessing we need to update our code to either explicitly double-escape with , or use  for "raw" strings.
