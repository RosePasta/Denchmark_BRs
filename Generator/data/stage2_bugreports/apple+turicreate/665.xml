	<summary>Style transfer: make coreml model to have flexible shape input/output</summary>
	<description>
First, it's not clear from the docstring whether it is (width, height) or (height, width). Internally, we often use (height, width) for implementation details. However, in for instance tc.image_analysis.resize the width argument precedes the height argument. So, we should first think about which is the most appropriate from a user point of view and then make this clear in the docstring.
We could also try to avoid this issue by separating into separate width and height parameters.

		We can keep default image_shape=(255, 255) and extend the coreml model to have flexible input and output shape
