		It might be worth identifying if we can hide all the logs for TF in 6.0

		This line is from coremltools not TensorFlow:

		Yes, that particular line from coremltools is not a regression from 5.8 but the other lines are from TensorFlow (the ones below)

		I believe even that line getting printed is a regression from 5.8. It was not getting printed in 5.8 because we were not using TensorFlow in 5.8. We should probably silence output of that line too.

		And I am supressing log from tensorflow and I had picked verbosity level to be error i.e. warnings should not be showing.

 Can you tell me which python were you using?

		Python 3.6 and Python 2.7. Do you not see this on master?

I see strange stuff in create not in export_coreml.

		I use to get this before WARNING:root:TensorFlow version 2.0.0 detected. Last version known to be fully compatible is 1.13.1 . I think it was because I had tensorflow==1.13.1 and then I upgraded to tensorflow==2.0 without ./configure --cleanup.
Also using
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '1'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

I can suppress most of it but not all of it.

		You will see things when TF launches the first time. Let's suppress as much as we can. We can only hope TF uses the log level appropriately :)

		That means I need to suppress it everywhere it is imported?
