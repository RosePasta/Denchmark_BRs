	<summary>Lapack not properly detected on build</summary>
	<description>
When building on ubuntu 16.04, the build process does not error out if lapack is not present.  Everything compiles fine, but the use of most of the machine learning algorithms results in std::logic_error: solve(): use of LAPACK must be enabled.

		We should make sure that:

We error out at compile time if lapack is not present
We error out at runtime if lapack is not present

 I know you hit this recently; want to see if there is an easy way we can error out in  or during the build, if lapack is missing?
