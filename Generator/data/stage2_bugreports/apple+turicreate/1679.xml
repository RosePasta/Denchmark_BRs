 if gram.context != _mx.cpu(0): 





Hardcoded the context.
Could this be slowing down the training. Every time the gram matrix computation is done in the training loop, are we going back to the CPU.
Follow up question. Are the ND-Array computations done on the GPU or the CPU?

		Non Issue. We cast back to ctx later. It's a one time setup cost.
