	<summary>Assignment to SFrame column with a scalar value differs in behavior from `add_column`</summary>
	<description>
Repro steps:
import turicreate as tc
sf = tc.SFrame()
sf = sf.add_column(5, 'x') # note that sf is len(1)

sf2 = tc.SFrame()
sf2['x'] = 5 # note that sf2 is len(0)
Expected:
sf and sf2 are equivalent
Actual:
sf2 contains no data (and the value 5 was dropped).
