	<summary>Linking errors building turi C API via build_capi.sh on CentOS 6.6</summary>
	<description>
Hi, I am trying to build the C API from master branch on CentOS 6.6. I am running the following command: cuild_capi.sh -r -j 1
There are many linking errors of duplicate symbols, all the clashes are with openssl.o:(BIO_s_bio).
I've attached stdout and stderr the script outputs.
&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/files/2730509/stdout_capi.txt&gt;stdout_capi.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/files/2730510/stderr_capi.txt&gt;stderr_capi.txt&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		We now included our own copy of Open SSL under deps. Is this still an issue?

		I haven't not heard back here. So I'm going to close this issue since it's likely already fixed. Please reopen if it's still a problem.
