	<summary>Cmd+Q doesn't quit Turi Create Visualization</summary>
	<description>
Affects all keyboard shortcuts that should do something outside the web view, whenever the web view window is focused. Appears to be caused by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/1781&gt;#1781&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. Now, even the keypresses that should do something, don't. (An exception to this is when the window is not focused but the application is, and then keyboard shortcuts work as expected.)
