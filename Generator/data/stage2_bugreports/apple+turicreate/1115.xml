	<summary>object_detector.create freezes when using multiple GPUs</summary>
	<description>
My specs are:
Turi Create: 5.0b3
CUDA: release 9.0, V9.0.176
mxnet: mxnet==1.1.0     mxnet-cu90==1.1.0
GPU: Nvidia Tesla K80 (8 of them)
How I reproduce the issue:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import turicreate as tc
mySframe = tc.load_sframe(filename='/mySframeFile/')
sampleModel = tc.object_detector.create(dataset=mySframe, feature='image', annotations='annotations', max_iterations=1, batch_size=512)
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;


Downloading https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/turicreate/models/darknet.params
Download completed: /var/tmp/model_cache/darknet.params
Setting 'batch_size' to 512
Using 8 GPUs to create model (CUDA)

I have also tried setting batch_size=0 which has the same result.
Update: using only 1 GPU made things work!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/SoroushKadineh&gt;@SoroushKadineh&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we are working on this but haven't been able to reproduce this on a toy dataset. 1. Are you able to reproduce this on a toy or programmatically created dataset?
2. If not, is the dataset that you face this issue with, publicly available?
Looking forward to hearing back from you!

: the issue was due to the virtual machine (I was using) not being able to handle multiple GPUs. I forgot to put an update, my apologies.
