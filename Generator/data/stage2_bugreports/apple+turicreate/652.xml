	<summary>Turi Create Visualization in 5.0b1 broken on macOS 10.13</summary>
	<description>
The visualization app seems to have been built for a macOS 10.14+ target. It refuses to run on 10.13 in 5.0b1.

		Still is not working for me. I am trying to visualize ~150 images.
turicreate: 5.1
MacOS: 10.13.5

 What happens for you on 10.13.5? If you see a loading screen indefinitely, you are probably hitting &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/88&gt;#88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 instead of this one.

		I think that was the issue. When I changed the shape of my image SFrame it seemed to work. Might be nice to have an error instead of indefinite loading.

		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/zoecarver&gt;@zoecarver&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 - we'll continue to track that issue in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/88&gt;#88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. It's proven to be very difficult to reproduce; once we are able to reproduce it, we should be able to load correctly (rather than erroring, or loading indefinitely).

 Thanks for the info. I will let you know if I find a good way to reproduce it.

 I'm trying to build an example (&lt;denchmark-link:https://becominghuman.ai/machine-learning-your-first-object-detection-58581795c246&gt;https://becominghuman.ai/machine-learning-your-first-object-detection-58581795c246&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) using turicreate on my Macbook Pro 13", but I'm running in to this issue with visualization. Is there a solution or a workaround meanwhile?

 I assume you are referring to the loading screen, as in issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/88&gt;#88&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
? So far, we have not found any workaround or fix, and I have been unable to consistently reproduce the issue. Keep an eye on that thread for any updates as we learn more.
