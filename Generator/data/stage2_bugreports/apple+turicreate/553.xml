	<summary>Configure failure: missing include symlink for Python 2.7</summary>

&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Configure failure: missing include symlink for Python 2.7
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Steps/Code to Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

unzip master.zip
cd turicreate-master
./configure
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Expected Results&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

Configure completes normally
&lt;denchmark-h:h4&gt;Actual Results&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

When running ./configure in preparation to build, it fails saying

/opt/turicreate-master

linux_patch_sigfpe_handler
[[ linux-gnu == linux* ]]
targfile=deps/local/include/pyfpe.h
echo '#undef WANT_SIGFPE_HANDLER'
cat - deps/local/include/pyfpe.h
cat: deps/local/include/pyfpe.h: No such file or directory


And higher up we see this has happened:


mkdir -p deps/local/lib
mkdir -p deps/local/include
pushd deps/local/include
/opt/turicreate-master/deps/local/include /opt/turicreate-master
++ ls '../../env/include/python2.7/'
ls: cannot access '../../env/include/python2.7/': No such file or directory


By that time the script has made .../deps/env/include and put a symlink in there to /usr/include/python3.6m called python3.6m but it needs to also create one to /usr/include/python2.7 called python2.7. Create that symlink by hand, go back up to the distribution root and do ./configure again and it will work. This is on Gentoo Linux and its order of preference for Python is currently 3.6, 3.4, 2.7, and 3.5.

 I'm guessing this is caused by lack of virtualenv (I suspect we don't really check for its existence, we just rely on it and fail to error out early enough if it's missing). The fix might be to check for virtualenv earlier and error out with a useful message.

		Nevermind, this is what you get if you don't have virtualenv:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;6692b6d7aa2a /turicreate # ./configure
Installing python toolchain.
python version = python2.7.
/turicreate /turicreate
+ set -e
+ [[ -z '' ]]
+ VIRTUALENV=virtualenv
+ PIP=pip3
+ PYTHON_FULL_NAME=python2.7m
+ [[ python2.7 == \p\y\t\h\o\n\2\.\7 ]]
+ PIP=pip
+ PYTHON_FULL_NAME=python2.7
+ virtualenv /turicreate/deps/env
./scripts/install_python_toolchain.sh: line 19: virtualenv: command not found
6692b6d7aa2a /turicreate # 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		Oh, I think this is what happens if you don't have libpython2.7-dev.

		Ok, I think the root cause of the issue here is that nothing is checking whether  supplied to  (or lack thereof, which is 2.7) matches the actual Python version. I think we should be using the &lt;denchmark-link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/#cmdoption-p&gt;--python=&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 option on virtualenv to make the environment's Python version match our  script.

		Looks like this will be fixed with the fix for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/494&gt;#494&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
