	<summary>turicreate.load_audio broken with home directory present.</summary>
	<description>
The following code generates a dataset that has no entries:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [13]: import turicreate as tc
    ...:
    ...: data = tc.load_audio("~/data/ESC-50/audio/")
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

However, the same code where the ~ is replaced by the absolute path name works fine.

		A ~ in the path also doesn't work with tc.load_images. It does however work for tc.load_sarray and tc.load_sframe.

		A ~ also works in the path for tc.load_model and tc.load_sgraph. So this just needs to be fixed in tc.load_audio and tc.load_images.
The functions that do this properly all seem to use the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/6709d22b2a904aafad7f93ac10d4762d75e60020/src/python/turicreate/util/__init__.py#L99&gt;_make_internal_url&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 method. It seems like using this will also fix other issues too (e.x. S3 paths).
