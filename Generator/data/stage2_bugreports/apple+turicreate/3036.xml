	<summary>Style Transfer Does Not Work</summary>
	<description>
The code included: &lt;denchmark-link:https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/style_transfer/&gt;https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/style_transfer/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 does not at all. It throws the following exception.
failed assertion `MTLTextureDescriptor has height (65536) greater than the maximum allowed size of 16384.'
Even though the image size for test, content and style images are 256 X 256.

 - I just ran the style transfer code from the user guide on macOS Catalina. It works fine  for me. Could you please provide the full output/stack-trace? Also it would be helpful to know some details about your dataset.
