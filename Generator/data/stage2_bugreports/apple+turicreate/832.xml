	<summary>TCRecommender uses string keys to refer to int item IDs</summary>
	<description>
The TCRecommender implementation always returns a dictionary with string keys, even if the model used int item IDs. So for models trained with int item IDs, the resulting Core ML model will throw (unwrapping optional nil) when accessed from Swift, since the cast to [Int64: Double] will fail.
