The functionality of prediction_id column given as output of predict when making prediction per window is not clear in documentation. The output given at the moment is the following.

 I don't think it should be solved with docs though. I mean the column  has no use if it just like the index/row number of the SFrame.

		From offline discussion, sounds like this is an occasion where the code is wrong, and needs to be fixed to match the intent captured in the user guide

 Is this fixed in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2431&gt;#2431&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. If so, can this be closed?

		If the  has been &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2431/files#diff-eca1b17099e6523db8cc3aedf37c1ddbL449&gt;removed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 from the output, then we'll also want to update the &lt;denchmark-link:https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/activity_classifier/&gt;docs&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 to match this.

		No, our end goal was not to remove prediction ID but to implement it correctly (starting over from 1 within each session). In &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2431&gt;#2431&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 we punted on doing it correctly and just removed it temporarily.
