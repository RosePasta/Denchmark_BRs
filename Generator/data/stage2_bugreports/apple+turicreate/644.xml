	<summary>Creating image classifier on a folder with hidden thumbnails file crashes</summary>
	<description>
Training an IC model on a main dir, containing sub dirs with images per class.
If the main directory had a .ds_store file - the training just crashed with an error (not warning).
It happened during a lab at WWDC. I'll repro the scenario and add the exact error and repro steps.

		I am not able to reproduce this issue in 5.0b1.
When the images are loaded. I do the following warning: Unsupported image format. Supported formats are JPEG and PNG	 file: /tmp/data/.DS_Store.
The image classifier model gets created fine.
