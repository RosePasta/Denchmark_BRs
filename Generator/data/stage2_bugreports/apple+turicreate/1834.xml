	<summary>Delay from .show until window appears in the foreground</summary>
	<description>
From when .show or .explore are called, it takes up to (what feels like about) a half second or so before the window appears. In some cases (not sure how to repro) it seems not to appear at all, until I switch to it.
I think we may be able to use  to fix this. See &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/1740423&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/1740423&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
