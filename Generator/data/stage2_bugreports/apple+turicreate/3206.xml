	<summary>Can not load audio, in non-minimal package</summary>
	<description>
Calling tc.load_audio, results in the following error message being printed for each file that it should load:
Could not read &lt;FILENAME&gt;: module 'scipy' has no attribute 'io'
Where &lt;FILENAME&gt; is the filename.
The return SFrame is empty.
It looks like this was broken by the fix for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/3195&gt;#3195&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
