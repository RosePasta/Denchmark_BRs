	<summary>`dropna` followed by `unpack` is not lazy.</summary>
	<description>
We observed that right before object detector training, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/master/src/python/turicreate/toolkits/object_detector/object_detector.py#L315&gt;this line&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 forces materialization of the SFrame. The expectation is that the code should execute lazily.
The dropna implementation creates a lambda function over all the rows and does the selection in the lambda function itself.  This means that the unpack call ends up cycling through all the images in the dataset instead of just the annotation columns.
