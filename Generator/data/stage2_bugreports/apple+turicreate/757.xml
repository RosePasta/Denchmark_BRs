	<summary>Inconsistent naming with supervised learning</summary>
	<description>
In supervised learning, there are a lot of inconsistent names printed.  For example, with logistic regression, it prints:
Step size | Elapsed Time | Training-accuracy | Training-log_loss  | Validation-accuracy
These should all be consistent, e.g.
Step Size | Elapsed Time | Training Accuracy | Training Log Loss | Validation Accuracy
