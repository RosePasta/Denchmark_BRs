	<summary>SArray == doesn't work for tc.Image types</summary>
	<description>
Using turicreate 5.6 the following code:
import turicreate as tc

i = tc.load_images('./test/images/sample.png')
i = i['image']

print("Images are equal: " + str(
    i[0] == i[0]
))
print("SArray indexes equals: " + str(
    i == i
))
Produces:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;Images are equal: True
SArray indexes equals: [0]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

So == works when comparing instances of tc.Image directly but doesn't work when they are inside an SArray.

 Hi, i am looking forward to fix this, i have a doubt, do we need to run ./configure and then build using "make" everytime we do a change? And is there any discussion platform for this repo?

 - you do not need to run  with every change. You just need to run . Currently we don't have a discussion platform for turicreate. If you have specific questions, feel free to open a GitHub issue for it.

		I have tracked down the comparison logic to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/037e112032c40c330885bf9cb7ba136d7a61e020/src/core/storage/sframe_interface/unity_sarray_binary_operations.cpp#L527&gt;unity_sarray_binary_operations.cpp&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 where the equality is performed by address comparison for every type. The fix would be to use image comparison if both elements are images. Are there any other types that would require special handling other than image?
