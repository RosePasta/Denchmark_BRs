		Just use the movieID column of the exclude_pairs SFrame, and the movieID column of ob as well.
The real bug here is that the recommend_from_interactions should not accept user information as part of either parameter and should instead error out.  Essentially, all the user data is dropped and not handled consistently, which is causing this issue.

Thanks for your reply!As shown below, recommend_from_interactions still can't rule out movieid 14.
Also,I would like to make a personalized recommendation system，if I don't use the userId，dose the result of recommendation have personality? Please help me...
