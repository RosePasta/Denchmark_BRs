	<summary>Build fails for want of xxd</summary>
	<description>
Need to include the xxd command as a dependency shown in BUILD.md. In Gentoo Linux it's provided by app-editors/vim; other distros may vary but I suspect it's the case across the board.

, this is a known issue. I'll add it in BUILD.md.
