	<summary>Object Dection Visualization Error in Turicreate Explore</summary>
	<description>
Hi All,
I have been recently exploring the object detection library, YOLO, for classification using Apple's Turicreate. However, while following this tutorial from Apple's GitHub: ### &lt;denchmark-link:https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/object_detection/&gt;https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/object_detection/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

I have been experiencing errors in the TuriCreateVisualization. When I run my program I am outputted with a box but I can't read the prediction accuracy and what it has predicted since the text is too small. Is there a way around this bug or problem, to see what the prediction and accuracy is?
I have attached a screenshot of the problem that is occuring. Please let me know if you have any solutions. &lt;denchmark-link:url&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

Thanks,
Yash

		I think this is happening because of the size of the input images, and is definitely a bug. Either very small, or very large images may render the text badly when bounding boxes are drawn. We should accommodate different sizes of images.
