	<summary>Magic string breaks SArray.explore()</summary>
	<description>
I had an SArray which broke explore(). Eventually tracked the problem down to a single string value: \\x.
Running:  tc.SArray(['\\x']).explore() causes the following to get printed:
Got error: "The data couldn’t be read because it isn’t in the correct format." while trying to read: {"data_spec": {"values": [{"__idx": "0","SArray": "\x"}]}}. A visualization window is create but it never finishes loading.
It seems that having \\x any where in the SArray causes explore to break. We get the same behavior with this code: tc.SArray(['a', 'b', 'foo\\xbar', 'x', 'y', 'z']).explore().

		The cause for this is that \x is one of the special character for unicode that needs to be followed by hex number, e.g. \x23, but we didn't detect and add special escape \x character before we pass it to the swift UI.

 - Thanks for figuring that out. Are there any other special characters that we should be escaping but aren't?

 Assuming that the special characters are in Swift (where the error was previously thrown), there are ,,,,,,  and  (&lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/StringsAndCharacters.html&gt;https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/StringsAndCharacters.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). I have tested all of them with two  characters and they all work properly.
