	<summary>read_csv with mismatched quote characters fails silently.</summary>
	<description>
The following (bad) file should error out; instead it fails silently.
Test.csv:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;a, b
"a", "b"
"c", "d
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Then gives this output:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [7]: X = tc.SFrame.read_csv("Test.csv")
Finished parsing file /Users/hoytak/Test.csv
Parsing completed. Parsed 1 lines in 0.035703 secs.
------------------------------------------------------
Inferred types from first 100 line(s) of file as
column_type_hints=[str,str]
If parsing fails due to incorrect types, you can correct
the inferred type list above and pass it to read_csv in
the column_type_hints argument
------------------------------------------------------
Finished parsing file /Users/hoytak/Test.csv
Parsing completed. Parsed 1 lines in 0.005156 secs.

In [8]: X
Out[8]:
Columns:
	a	str
	b	str

Rows: 1

Data:
+---+---+
| a | b |

| a | b |
+---+---+
[1 rows x 2 columns]

In [9]: cat Test.csv
a, b
"a", "b"
"c", "d
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Note that this also drops all subsequent lines:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [12]: X = tc.SFrame.read_csv("Test.csv")
Finished parsing file /Users/hoytak/Test.csv
Parsing completed. Parsed 1 lines in 0.028732 secs.
