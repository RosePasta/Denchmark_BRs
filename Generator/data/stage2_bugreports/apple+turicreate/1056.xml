	<summary>VisionFeaturePrint - Screen or Scene?</summary>
	<description>
Everywhere in the Create ML documentation, the feature extractor is termed the scene print feature extractor, but everywhere in the Turi Create documentation it is termed screen print. Is this interchangeable, is one of them incorrect, or are they actually different extractor types?

		This is a typo. It should be scene. We will fix it in the next release along with all the documentation.
