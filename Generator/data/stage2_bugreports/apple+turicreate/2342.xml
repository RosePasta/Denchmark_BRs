	<summary>Importing Turicreate Version 4.1 with Python3.6</summary>
	<description>
Hi,
We have been trying to work in a virtual machine at work to convert our Python 2 jobs to Python 3. Whenever we were using turicreate4.0 with Python2.7 we had no issues. When we switched to Python 3 we keep seeing this error:
"Traceback (most recent call last):
File "src/features/build_features.py", line 5, in 
import turicreate as tc
File "/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/turicreate/init.py", line 30, in 
from turicreate.data_structures.sgraph import Vertex, Edge
File "/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/turicreate/data_structures/init.py", line 18, in 
from . import sframe
File "/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/turicreate/data_structures/sframe.py", line 16, in 
from ..connect import main as glconnect
File "/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/turicreate/connect/main.py", line 13, in 
from ..cython.cy_unity import UnityGlobalProxy
ImportError: libpython3.6m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
We have searched a lot for this same error and the instructions were mainly focused on either using sudo, or installing some other packages via apt-get. We do not have any of the necessary privileges to do any of those fixes, and also the same package is working in the same machine in a Python 2.7 environment. Could you please help us how to get rid of this import issue without suggesting to use any sudo or apt-get. We can install packages to the virtual environment through pip; but we cannot use sudo.
Thank you for your time!

		Hi,

We are already using a virtualenv. I forgot to mention that. We create a python3.6 virtual environment and still see the same error.

Kind regards,
Murat.

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/gamemania&gt;@gamemania&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, I think this may be fixed in later releases of Turi Create. I'm not sure exactly which release it would have been fixed in, but could you try upgrading to a later (5.x) release and see if it works (both for your use case, and if it fixes this issue in particular)?

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/znation&gt;@znation&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 thank you very much for the suggestion. Here is the error I get when we have turicreate5.7.1:
"ImportError: libbz2.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory".
When we use turicreate 4.0 with Python 2.6, we are not seeing any error. I am not sure why is this problem occurring in Python 3.x (we tried on 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7), and turicreate &gt;= 4.1.0.
Thank you all again for all your help!

		The most recent issue (i.e. the libbz2.so.1.0 issue) looks like a dup of &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2302&gt;#2302&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Closing this issue. The original problem has been fixed and we have another issue (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/2302&gt;#2302&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
) for the new problem mentioned here.
