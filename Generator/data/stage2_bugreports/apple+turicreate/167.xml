	<summary>Histogram of ints should have integer bin boundaries</summary>
	<description>
See screenshot. When computing a histogram of integers, the bin boundaries should also be integers. Currently they are floating point (and may not align to the int values in the dataset).

		For this, we probably want to revisit how we compute the histogram in the first place. The streaming histogram logic as it is may depend on the ranges being floating point.

		We can't fix the tick alignment until we have Vega 5.0, which brings proper support for this (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/1582&gt;#1582&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
). This issue will track the bin boundary alignments specifically for int histogram. (It's hard to tell from the screenshot in this issue, but the underlying issue here is actually that the bin boundaries themselves aren't int-aligned.)
