	<summary>load_images with relative paths broken in unity_sframe</summary>
	<description>
Loading of images with relative paths going through the load_images path in unity/lib/image_util.cpp has several issues, causing relative paths of the form "../&lt;dir&gt;/image" to not work, IMAGE.jpg to match image.jpg, and it's very slow when the directories are large.  This code needs to be made more robust and performant.

 Can you please give repro steps for each of the issues here with expected/actual behavior? Relative paths should already work (having been somewhat tested already), and case-sensitivity sounds like a filesystem-level issue (the default FS on macOS is case-insensitive) so perhaps by design.

		Went over this in-person with &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hoytak&gt;@hoytak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. From code inspection, it looks like the issue is there are some relative path handling problems with , and possibly case sensitivity issues. We should more thoroughly unit test this code path and address issues there.

Could you &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/hoytak&gt;@hoytak&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 point me how to reproduce it?

		Ah, I misunderstand this problem. I can load CAT.png as well, which shouldn't be loaded.

mac fs and hdfs is a case insensitive file system. Need extra logic to wrap stat.

load relative directory also works.
