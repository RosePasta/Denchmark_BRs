	<summary>Toolkits are missing __repr__</summary>
	<description>
Currently, we get the following output with some toolkits in 6.0 master (using DC as an example).
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [31]: model
Out[31]: DrawingClassifier_beta
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Close this issue when all boxes are checked:

 Drawing Classifier (#2669)
 Object Detector (#2671)
 Style Transfer (#2711)
 Activity classifier (#2680)

 Can be all fixed in one PR since it's probably the same template that needs to be moved from 5.8

		This is a little more nuanced than just a copy-paste. State variables need to be added/modified, and the summary struct needs to be modified in some places too. I suggest breaking this up into separate issues (and PRs, albeit small) by toolkit. What do you think &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/srikris&gt;@srikris&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

		Based on offline conversations, I think it might make sense to put it into a single PR. It should be a pretty small PR.

		On second thought, doing it by toolkit would actually be simpler and easier to review. It would also ensure we don't have any regressions.

		Per offline discussion, updated this issue to track all toolkits and will put up PRs per toolkit.
