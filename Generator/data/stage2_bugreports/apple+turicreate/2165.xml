RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment. Consult &lt;denchmark-link:https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/python3/&gt;https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/python3/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 for mitigation steps.
This system supports the C.UTF-8 locale which is recommended.
You might be able to resolve your issue by exporting the
following environment variables:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
export LANG=C.UTF-8
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

		We should just remove that line and make sure all the tests pass.  I believe that was a workaround for something that is no longer an issue.
