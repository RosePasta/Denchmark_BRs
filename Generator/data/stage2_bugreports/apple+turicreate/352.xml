	<summary>When converting SArray of strings to float, strings starting with inf will become float('inf')</summary>
	<description>
Hello,
If your str-typed SArray contains only strings starting with 'inf' and you are trying to convert it to float, what you will get instead of a raised exception is an array of the 'infinite' float.
This happened to me while I was going through my columns and using try/catch to see which ones I could convert to float. Not a very common use case, I admit, but still...

Out[2]: '4.2'

In [3]: float('inf')  # the expected result
Out[3]: inf

In [4]: tc.SArray(['inf', 'infamous', 'infrequent', 'INFINITE']).astype(float)  # some actual mishaps beside it
Out[4]:
dtype: float
Rows: 4
[inf, inf, inf, inf]

In [5]: tc.SArray(['foo']).astype(float) # what I expect
...traceback omitted...
RuntimeError: Unable to interpret foo as the target type.

		This is a side effect of an unfortunate simple direct use of strtod.
More generally, this is occurs for strings prefixed with numbers as well
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;In [5]: tc.SArray(["2hello","2.3world"]).astype(float)
Out[5]:
dtype: float
Rows: 2
[2.0, 2.3]

In [6]: tc.SArray(["2hello","2.3world"]).astype(int)
Out[6]:
dtype: int
Rows: 2
[2, 2]
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
