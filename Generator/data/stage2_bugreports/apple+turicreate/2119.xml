	<summary>Reconcile Vega.js versions and upgrade to Vega 5</summary>
	<description>
The current &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/vega/vega/releases&gt;latest release&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 of Vega is 5.4.0.
Currently in Turi Create, we are using the following versions:

3.2.1 in Turi Create Python (web based rendering).
4.4.0 in Vega Renderer (macOS native/C API rendering).

They give slightly different behavior, and 5.x has features we'd like to adopt. We should upgrade.
