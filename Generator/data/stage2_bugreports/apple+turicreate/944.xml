	<summary>style_transfer not working in beta 3</summary>
	<description>
Error when I run python script:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;    model = turicreate.style_transfer.create(content_images, style_images, max_iterations = 5)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'style_transfer'
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Python code:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;import turicreate
 
# Use all GPUs (default)
turicreate.config.set_num_gpus(-1)
 
# Use only 1 GPU
#turicreate.config.set_num_gpus(1)
 
# Use CPU
#turicreate.config.set_num_gpus(0)
 
# Load data
content_images = turicreate.image_analysis.load_images("content/")
style_images = turicreate.image_analysis.load_images("style/")
 
# Create a model
model = turicreate.style_transfer.create(content_images, style_images, max_iterations = 5)
 
# Save the model
model.save('MyStyles.model')
 
# Export for deployment
model.export_coreml("MyStyles.mlmodel")
 
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

Environment:
OS macOS 10.14 (18A347e)
turicreate 5.0 b3

		I am not able to repro this.
Can you double check the version?
import turicreate as tc
print(tc.__version__)

		I switched back to 5.0b1 to do some experimenting. Will need to switch to current beta to check. Sorr about the delay!

		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/talyn&gt;@talyn&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
, have you had a chance to check whether this repros for you in 5.0b3? Thanks!

		Finally figured this out. I was seeing this:

mxnet 1.1.0.post0 has requirement requests&lt;2.19.0,&gt;=2.18.4, but you'll have requests 2.19.0 which is incompatible.

So I installed requests 2.18.4, and now it works. Sorry about the false alarm!

		The problem was this:
mxnet 1.1.0.post0 has requirement requests&lt;2.19.0,&gt;=2.18.4, but you'll have requests 2.19.0 which is incompatible. 
Once I downgraded requests to 2.18.4, it worked fine.
