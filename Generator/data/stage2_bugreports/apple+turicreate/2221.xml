import turicreate as tc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

sa = tc.SArray(range(10))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
d = {1:1}

sa.filter_by(d.keys())         # Does not work 
sa.filter_by(d.values())       # Also does not work

# of course this can be solve by doing: 
sa.filter_by(list(d.keys()))
sa.filter_by(list(d.values()))
This issue is only effecting Python 3. This issues should also be fixed for sframe.filter_by.
The fix here could be quite similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/1723&gt;#1723&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
. However we should consider doing something more general, rather than special casing each possible type. We probably want to allow any iterable type as input. Determining if an object is iterable &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952464/in-python-how-do-i-determine-if-an-object-is-iterable&gt;is not straight forward&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
.
