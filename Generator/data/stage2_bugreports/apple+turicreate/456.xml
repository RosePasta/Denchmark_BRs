	<summary>Initial window size for canvas should be at least as big as the plot that appears</summary>
	<description>
I tried to make a heatmap and the plot was bigger than the initial canvas size. I would expect the initial canvas to resize based on how big of a plot it's about to render. This is on macOS High Sierra, here's the repro:
&lt;denchmark-code&gt;x = tc.SArray(range(1,3000000))
y = tc.SArray(range(5,3000004))
heat = tc.visualization.heatmap(x,y)
heat.show()
&lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
