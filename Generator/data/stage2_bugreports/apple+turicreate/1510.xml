 - I think you should fix this one. Let's fix this for the next release.
You could just change vectors to list(vector), but if it works, it's probably better to use copy.copy. Also would be great to have a unit test to cover this bug.

		I am deploying a solution and can you tell me which turicreate version I should use meanwhile which doesn't have this bug?

		 turicreate==5.2.1 works fine for me.

		I ended up going into the image_classifier.py source code found in the error and turning vecs into a list with "list()" before hand and all worked. This was in turicreate 5.5.
