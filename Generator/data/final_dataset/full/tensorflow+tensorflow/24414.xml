 A recent commit (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/10ef7edc881ee715eaae48656fcb431fe128441f&gt;10ef7ed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) changed the default contraction kernel to be MKL based. Code was added for non-intel platforms to avoid MKL, but it has an error.
 Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before running into the problem
 Basic build: bazel build //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
 Any other info / logs
 Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;ERROR: /home/jenkins/workspace/TensorFlow_PPC64LE_GPU_Build/tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD:610:12: Illegal ambiguous match on configurable attribute "deps" in //tensorflow/core/kernels:eigen_contraction_kernel:
 //tensorflow:linux_ppc64le
 //tensorflow/core/kernels:no_mkldnn_contraction_kernel
 Multiple matches are not allowed unless one is unambiguously more specialized.
 ERROR: Analysis of target '//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package' failed; build aborted:

 //tensorflow/core/kernels:no_mkldnn_contraction_kernel
 Multiple matches are not allowed unless one is unambiguously more specialized.
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 There ends up being multiple matches in the select call:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;defines = select({
         "//tensorflow:android": [],
         "//tensorflow:arm": [],
         "//tensorflow:ios": [],
         "//tensorflow:linux_ppc64le": [],
         ":no_mkldnn_contraction_kernel": [],
         "//conditions:default": [
             "TENSORFLOW_USE_CUSTOM_CONTRACTION_KERNEL",
             "TENSORFLOW_USE_MKLDNN_CONTRACTION_KERNEL",
         ],
     }),
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Either the arch-specific entries in the select call should be removed, or the no_mkldnn_contraction_kernel entry should be removed for this to work.
 I'll follow up with a proposed patch set.

 		The fix for this issue was reverted with:
 [Temporarily disable MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default] &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ca8791fc6db991c6c7406f3274ca742d867e0c6b&gt;ca8791f&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 Temporarily, but its been almost a month.
 I had suggested a fix that made sense to me: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/24416&gt;#24416&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 But it wasn't accepted.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/penpornk&gt;@penpornk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  What is the plan for this setting in the .bazelrc ?  If the idea is to switch it on and off regularly, please know that it breaks all non Intel builds.
 Please advise.

 		The problem is  is only ever defined if on x86_64. So setting it at all (on or off) is a problem for other arches. My attempted fix in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/24416&gt;#24416&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  was to let that be defined for other arches too, so that disabling it will have an effect.
 If I could get clarity on what was unacceptable in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/24416&gt;#24416&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  perhaps I could change it so this setting would work for everyone. Any feedback?

 		I'm so sorry for the inconvenience! I forgot that disabling the feature would reintroduce this issue.
 
 @penpornk What is the plan for this setting in the .bazelrc ? If the idea is to switch it on and off regularly, please know that it breaks all non Intel builds.
 
 We planned to leave it on indefinitely. I switched it off to debug an issue.
 
 If I could get clarity on what was unacceptable in #24416 perhaps I could change it so this setting would work for everyone. Any feedback?
 
 I apologize that we didn't explain properly. Back then, we were about to turn the feature on (i.e., not matching with no_mkldnn_contraction_kernel). The following targets don't support the feature so we had to keep them to prevent matching with //conditions:default
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;        "//tensorflow:android": [],
         "//tensorflow:arm": [],
         "//tensorflow:ios": [],
         "//tensorflow:linux_ppc64le": [],
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 I'll delete these targets for now and add them back when I re-enable the feature.
 If you'd like to contribute to a permanent fix, the conditions are
 
 Never match with //conditions:default for //tensorflow:android, //tensorflow:arm, //tensorflow:ios, and //tensorflow:linux_ppc64le, regardless of the no_mkldnn_contraction_kernel target.
 If none of the above four target matches, match with no_mkldnn_contraction_kernel iff --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0 is set.
 
 Thank you again for raising this issue!

  makes sense to me. I'll give it a shot on ppc64le to confirm.

 		Confirmed. No dual match on ppc64le when  is set.
 Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/penpornk&gt;@penpornk&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
