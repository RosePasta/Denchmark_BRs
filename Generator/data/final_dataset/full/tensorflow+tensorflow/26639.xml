 	<summary>Nasnet models don't support custom image sizes even if include_top is set to False</summary>
 	<description>
 The general idea for fine-tuning pre-trained models with a custom image size is to set the include_top parameter to False when loading the models. However it doesn't seem to be working with the Nasnet models in tf.keras so far. All other models including Inception are working fine.
 Note: I was using tensorflow 2.0 alpha so I'm not sure if that is the problem.
 I believe maybe some issue somewhere in checking dimension size along with the include_top flag but I might be wrong.
 Following is the stack trace.

 		Hi, it's mentioned in the previous comment, reposting here again separately.
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;nasnet = tf.keras.applications.nasnet.NASNetLarge(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', 
                                                   input_shape=(100, 100, 3))
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		That is just random initialization of weights, the whole point of using this is to do transfer learning with pre-trained weights obtained from imagenet. Using weights=None defeats the purpose of doing that. That's the same like building your own CNN and copying the layers from Nasnet.

 		I understand.but then you see in practice, nasnet was requiring fixed image size after loading imagenet.whats the solution to that besides dumping imagenet?-------- Original Message --------Subject: Re: [tensorflow/tensorflow] Nasnet models don't support custom image sizes even if include_top is set to False (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26639&gt;#26639&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 		fixing the API so it is consistent with the other pre-trained models I guess?

 		The problem is not with the TensorFlow itself, but with the  module. The reason for such behavior of NASNet is described &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/keras-team/keras-applications/pull/62&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . So it's more likely a bug than a feature, however, I think that documentation should be updated.

 		I just ran into this, agree the documentation should be updated - both the tensorflow and keras documentation say that you should be able to set input_shape to something other than (331,331,3).

 		The documentation for loading weights with correct input_shape has been updated. Thanks!
