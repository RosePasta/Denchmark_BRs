 	<summary>It seems that Tensorflow needs a check for the unreasonable parameter `input_dim=0` in the layer `Embedding`.</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;System information&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 
 Have I written custom code (as opposed to using example directory):
 OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows 10 &amp; Linux Ubuntu 18.04
 Tensorflow version：2.1.0-cpu (using 'pip install TensorFlow' to download directly)
 Python version: 3.6.9
 CUDA/cuDNN version: -
 GPU model and memory: -
 
 &lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Describe the current behavior&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 When I build the model with an illogical parameter input_dim = 0in the layer Embedding, Tensorflow uses this unreasonably parameter to build and even save the model. The detailed performance in building the model is shown in the following picture。
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46860123/77224293-27355480-6b9f-11ea-9d96-df3e852ca4b3.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 &lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Key insights&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 To sum up, input_dim or output_dim = 0 are unreasonable corner cases. ** Tensorflow seems to lack in checking this corner case**. This may lead Tensorflow users to create and even save a wrong model, which will bring potential risks in the subsequent usage.
 &lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Code to reproduce the issue&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 import numpy as np
 import tensorflow.keras.layers as L 
 from tensorflow.keras import Model, Input
 import tensorflow
 import os
 
 print(tensorflow.__version__) 
 
 kwargs = {
     'input_dim': 0, # you can also set input_dim to 0 to test
 	'output_dim': 18,
 	'mask_zero': True
 }
 input = (10 * np.random.random((32,10)))
 layer = L.Embedding(**kwargs)
 x = Input(batch_shape=input.shape)
 y = layer(x)
 bk_model = Model(x, y)
 model_path = os.path.join('./', 'mode.h5')
 bk_model.save(model_path, bk_model)
 print('finish')

 		The code you have written is not correct you are not passing any input to the model.TensorFlow creates a static graph and the checks for the correct dimension during execution
 Write you code then at the end writebk_model(input) .You will see some error this is because the dimension of your tensor is (32,10) now change 'input_dim': 0 to 'input_dim': 10 and run again,it will work.

 Hello! Thank you for your reply!
 I have tested the code with the change you said. And when I set the  ,it did make a normal prediction.  But as I described above, 
 I saw on the TensorFlow document &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . On this page, it mentions that the inputdim should be greater than zero, but it seems that we can still build the model with .
 I want to emphasize that , thus the corner case like can be used to build a model by TensorFlow and save a corresponding model----even if this model is just a static graph. This may confuse users.
 Additionally, adding a check for the illogical parameter is not a difficult job. As shown &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1e102f63964365d82d7f22402b7ba21e0e0e64fe&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , Tensorflow has previously fixed a similar problem that people can build a model when using

 Thank you for your reply!
 I wonder if you are using a wrong &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1e102f63964365d82d7f22402b7ba21e0e0e64fe&gt;link&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 in your reply, because this link is the same as the one in my comments and it is related to the conv layer, not the Embedding.

 Oh sorry, I meant to close another issue
