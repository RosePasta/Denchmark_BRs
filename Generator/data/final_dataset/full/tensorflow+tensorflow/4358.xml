 	<summary>Wrong example script in the docs for preprocessing data</summary>
 	<description>
 I was reading the &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/reading_data/index.html#preprocessing&gt;docs for preprocessing&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , which is a small paragraph linking to the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10.py&gt;CIFAR-10 network&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  as an example. However, that script does not perform any preprocessing. Do we have a better example illustrating preprocessing steps like data normalization, distorting images, etc?

 		This is a question better suited for StackOverflow. Please ask it there and tag it with the tensorflow tag."

  Are you sure? I'm mainly pointing at a "bug" in the docs. I'm not asking for anything, my question was just to suggest a way of improving the docs.

 		Ah ok. I took that last sentence you wrote " Do we have a better example illustrating preprocessing steps like data normalization, distorting images, etc?". As a general question.

 		The folder holding the file referenced in the docs has, e.g. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_input.py&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.10/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_input.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , which does contain a  routine, is this what you're looking for? If so, then the easiest fix is just to change the link in the docs to point to the cifar10_input.py file instead of the cifar10.py file that imports it (line 47)

 		Thanks. Yes, I think that would be suitable. Do you want to create a pull request? Otherwise, I can do that.
