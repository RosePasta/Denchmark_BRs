 	<summary>tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v3.preprocess_input documentation not according source code</summary>
 	<description>
 In &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/mobilenet_v3/preprocess_input&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/mobilenet_v3/preprocess_input&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/mobilenet_v3/preprocess_input#returns&gt;Said &lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  that:
 Preprocessed numpy.array or a tf.Tensor with type float32.
 The inputs pixel values are scaled between -1 and 1, sample-wise.
 However in source code in GitHub you find this:
 @keras_export('keras.applications.mobilenet_v3.preprocess_input')
 def preprocess_input(x, data_format=None):  # pylint: disable=unused-argument
 return x
 And if you check it in a notebook you see that as source code state it is doing nothing. Do not scale and do not change dtype to float32 of the input.

 		Thanks for reporting the issue.
 To give more context, the preprocess_input() was a standard method for all models to normalize the input data. However, it is quite common that user forget to call this method before they feed the data to model, which result into poor result. When we realized this problem, we move the preprocessing logic from this method to the model itself for some new models (like mobilenet_v3). In order to keep the alignment between old and new model, we still keep this method for new model, but as an empty shell, so that user can easily switching between different version of models without changing much code.
 I will update the docstring for this method to make it align with the implementation detail.
