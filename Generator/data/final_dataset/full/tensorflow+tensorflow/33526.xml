 Describe the current behavior
 Unable to import tf.broadcast_weights in TF 2.0.
 Describe the expected behavior
 Should be able to import tf.broadcast_weights in TF 2.0
 Code to reproduce the issue
 Provide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
 Method 1: Plain python + TF 2.0
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;import tensorflow as tf     # version 2.0
 tf.broadcast_weights
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 throws ** AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'broadcast_weights'**
 Method 2: Codelab
 I found this error in a recent TF 2.0 + Keras tutorial - &lt;denchmark-link:https://colab.sandbox.google.com/drive/1UCJt8EYjlzCs1H1d1X0iDGYJsHKwu-NO&gt;https://colab.sandbox.google.com/drive/1UCJt8EYjlzCs1H1d1X0iDGYJsHKwu-NO&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  Thanks for finding the bug in the doc. Could you point us to the source of the notebook. Where did you find this notebook? Thanks!

  I found this issue while trying out a recent tutorial published by Fran√ßois Chollet

 Search for "tf.broadcast_weights" in this tutorial.
 Usage 2:
 This API is also used in the TF website here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/Metric&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/Metric&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  Thanks for the links. First link is already updated by the author. We will work on updating link in the . Thanks!

  I think we need to update &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/Metric&gt;this page&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . The issue is in this line
 sample_weight = tf.broadcast_weights(sample_weight, values)
 where tf.broadcast_weights throws AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'broadcast_weights'.
 I don't think this tf.broadcast_weights is exposed to the public. Thank you!

  I confirmed all the codes of the tf.broadcast_weights in 
 ,
 
 
 
 tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/metrics.py
 
 
          Line 23
       in
       9590c4c
 
 
 
 
 
 
  from tensorflow.python.ops.metrics_impl import * 
 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
 tensorflow/tensorflow/python/ops/metrics_impl.py
 
 
          Line 35
       in
       9590c4c
 
 
 
 
 
 
  from tensorflow.python.ops import weights_broadcast_ops 
 
 
 
 
 
 And these all seem fine. But still, tf.broadcast_weights throughs Attribute error.

 		tf.broadcast_weights does not work and is still referenced here (&lt;denchmark-link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/Metric&gt;https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/Metric&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 		The issue is that tf.broadcast_weights is not exposed through tf_export, wondering if it makes sense to expose this API given it is referenced in multiple places?

 		I think we need to remove the reference to tf.broadcast_weights from the documentation.

 		I take a look at the usage of tf.broadcast_weights in docstring. The related docstring is just an example,  and broadcast_weights by itself is just to make sure it follow a subset of broadcast rules than tf.multiply. It actually makes sense to remove this line as it does not add much to be an example in docs:
          sample_weight = tf.cast(sample_weight, self.dtype)
 -        sample_weight = tf.broadcast_weights(sample_weight, values)
          values = tf.multiply(values, sample_weight)
 Created a PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/39161&gt;#39161&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  for the fix.
