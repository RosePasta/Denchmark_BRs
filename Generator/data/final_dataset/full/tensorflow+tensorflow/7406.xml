 	<summary>Should check whether n_class is zero before calling sample_n() in mixture.py</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Problem Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Mixture model first use categorical to sample how much samples it need for each mixture components (this is variable  at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/mixture.py#L308&gt;line 308&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , but it actually means ), and then it pass  to .
 The problem is  could be 0 and you can't pass  to , which is used in Beta distribution. (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/distributions/python/ops/mixture.py#L310&gt;line 310&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  in mixture.py)
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 It's easy to reproduce: just create a mixture of Beta + Uniform with 50/50 probability. Half of the time it'll sample from uniform, and half of the time it'll sample from Beta.
 #!/usr/bin/python
 import tensorflow as tf
 ds = tf.contrib.distributions
 
 # Create mixture distribution of Beta + Uniform
 components = [ds.Beta(2., 2.), ds.Uniform(a=0., b=1.)]
 cat = ds.Categorical(p=[0.5, 0.5])
 mix = ds.Mixture(cat=cat, components=components)
 
 # get ONLY 1 sample
 x = mix.sample_n(1)
 
 with tf.Session() as sess:
     sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())    
     # repeats until crash
     for i in range(1000):
         print sess.run(x)
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What other attempted solutions have you tried?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Two possible solutions:
 
 
 Add a conditional branch in mixture.py like this (tested with the above script):
 # INSTEAD OF DOING
 # samples_class_c = self.components[c].sample_n(n_class, seed=seed)
 # DO THIS
 samples_class_c = control_flow_ops.cond(
     math_ops.equal(n_class, 0),
     lambda: array_ops.zeros(0, self.components[c].dtype),
     lambda: self.components[c].sample_n(n_class, seed=seed)
 )
 Just create a zero tensor with shape 0 when n_class is 0 and let the reshape operator at line 330 to worry about the shape.
 
 
 Support shape=0 in random_gamma(shape, alpha, ...). Personally I think it's a bad idea. It already caused InvalidArgumentError exception, which means the one who implemented this might already considered this problem before.
 
 
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Logs or other output that would be helpful&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;

 P.S. The variable name n_class confused me for a while.

 		The bug here is that  doesn't allow zero samples.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/random_op.cc#L306&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/random_op.cc#L306&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  should be fixed to exit early in that case rather than crashing.  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/brianwa84&gt;@brianwa84&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 		Returning a zero shape tensor is OK for the zero sample use-case. Feel free
 to submit the pull request.
