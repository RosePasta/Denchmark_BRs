 	<summary>Photoprism fails with "illegal instruction"</summary>
 	<description>
 I try to setup Photoprism in Docker, and when running it the only output I get is:
 
 photoprism_1        | Illegal instruction (core dumped)
 
 The docker-compose snippet that I use for Photoprism:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;    photoprism:
         image: photoprism/photoprism
         volumes:
             - /mnt/nas/pictures/2019/JPG/:/home/photoprism/Pictures/Originals/:ro
         labels:
             - "traefik.enable=true"
             - "traefik.port=2342"
             - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:pics.hostname"
             - "traefik.docker.network=my_gateway"
         networks:
             - gateway
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 This is running on a 64 bit linux install, what am I missing.
 Unrelated: is there an IRC/Matrix room with users?

 		Same issue here, using latest container. My docker-compose.yml:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;version: '3.6'
 
 volumes:
     photoprism_db:
         driver: local
         name: photoprism_db
     photoprism_cache:
         driver: local
         name: photoprism_cache
 
 services:
     photoprism:
         container_name: photoprism
         restart: unless-stopped
         volumes:
             - '/media/photos:/home/photoprism/Pictures/Originals:ro'
             - 'photoprism_cache:/home/photoprism/.cache/photoprism'
             - 'photoprism_db:/home/photoprism/.local/share/photoprism/resources/database'
         ports:
             - '2342:2342'
         image: photoprism/photoprism
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		I'm having the same issue. It appears that this fascinating and audacious project is not currently quite ready even for beta-level testing, at least from a project infrastructure standpoint; a bit more maturity will lead to automated testing that will catch breaking commits. Absolutely amazed by where this is going, though. The demo looks fantastic.

 		Same issue here - looks like a great piece of software - will keep trying and hoping this is fixed. Running docker on ubuntu server.

 		Sorry for not getting back to you earlier... crazy busy after coming back from vacation. I just pushed a version of the Dockerfile without AVX2 support, that should fix it.

 		Let me know it if works now! You'll have to pull the latest container image from Docker Hub.

 		Hi
 
 Yes, that had fixed the core dump and I can see the UI now.
 
 I am getting a bunch of other errors on indexing, but don't have time to
 look right now.
 
 I will do further tests soon
 
 Thank you for fixing it and letting me know.
 
 Cheers
 
 George
