 	<summary>error install photoprism rpi 4 4gb</summary>
 	<description>
 Hello everyone.
 I have little general knowledge in the area (docker, docker-compose, etc.), for this reason, I apologize for any lack of knowledge of mine, I only know the basics to run what I want and need, always using the most advanced users.
 I am delighted with the Photoprism project, I discovered it just over 4 days ago.
 The idea is great, congratulations.
 I'm looking to install it on rpi 4 4gb, which is running OVM (openmediavault) docker, docker-compose and portainer.
 I have some containers running well.
 When I try to install photoprism, through docker-compose, I have this output:
 root @ server: / home / pi # docker-compose up
 Creating network "pi_default" with the default driver
 Creating pi_watchtower_1 ... done
 Creating pi_photoprism_1 ... done
 Attaching to pi_watchtower_1, pi_photoprism_1
 photoprism_1 | standard_init_linux.go: 211: exec user process caused "exec format error"

 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 0
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 pi_photoprism_1 exited with code 1
 It is the exit table that I have when I try to install something that does not run on the rpi platform (arm64).

 		Thanks for reporting this, I suspect the error is related to our new entry file.
 You should try either using Docker to set the user and group like user: "1000:1000" or set GID / UID via environment variable. Maybe it doesn't work because you did both?

 		Just improved our entrypoint.sh script that runs before Docker starts PhotoPrism.
 UID/GID handling and the exec call have been changed, so it might work. Can you pull our latest image (available in about one hour if the &lt;denchmark-link:https://drone.photoprism.app/photoprism/photoprism/159/1/1&gt;build&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  doesn't fail) and then test again?
 Thank you :)

 		Had to restart the build, but now it seems to work. New image for ARM64 is already available.

 		Good night.
 I must thank you.
 I will try the new image as soon as possible, I believe tomorrow morning. I'm looking forward to it, because I loved the idea of Photoprism.
 I intend to be peculiar within my limitations. Be it with some amount of money (lately the exchange rate is terrifying for my country's currency, about 6 to 1, lol) but I want to contribute and encourage the development of this project.
 I wish you much success and luck.

 First of all, thank you for the effort and everything.
 I checked everything and made sure everything was correct.
 I copied the ".yml" file without making any changes.
 After the "docher-compose up" command, the installation went smoothly.
 I noticed that Photoprism works.
 Tomorrow I will do a wider, more effective scan with my settings.
 This problem has been successfully resolved.
 Once again, thank you.
 Success.
