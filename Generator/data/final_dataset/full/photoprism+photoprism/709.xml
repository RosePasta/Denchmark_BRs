 	<summary>Darktable: Build fails because of unmet dependencies</summary>
 	<description>
 Docker builds currently fail because the Darktable package has unmet dependencies:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
 requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
 distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
 or been moved out of Incoming.
 The following information may help to resolve the situation:
 
 The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 
 darktable : 
 Depends: libexiv2-27 (&gt;= 0.27.3) but it is not going to be installed
 Depends: libilmbase25 (&gt;= 2.5.3) but it is not installable
 Depends: libjson-glib-1.0-0 (&gt;= 1.5.2) but 1.4.4-2ubuntu2 is to be installed
 Depends: libopenexr25 (&gt;= 2.5.3) but it is not installable
 
 E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
