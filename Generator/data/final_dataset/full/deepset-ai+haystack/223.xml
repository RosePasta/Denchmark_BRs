 	<description>
 I get the following error when trying to ask the model a question. My pipeline looks like this:
 def pipeline(docs, questions):
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()
 document_store.write_documents(docs)
 retriever = TfidfRetriever(document_store=document_store)
 reader = FARMReader(model_name_or_path="deepset/roberta-base-squad2", use_gpu=False)
 finder = Finder(reader, retriever)
 predictions = {}
 for question in questions:
 	predictions[question] = finder.get_answers(question=question, top_k_retriever=5, top_k_reader=3)
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;return predictions
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Error message
 File ".../model.py", line 23, in pipeline
 predictions[question] = finder.get_answers(question=question, top_k_retriever=5, top_k_reader=3)
 File "...venv\lib\site-packages\haystack\finder.py", line 57, in get_answers

 Expected behavior
 Return model predictions

 		Did you try doing this:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;for question in questions:
 	prediction = finder.get_answers(question=question, top_k_retriever=5, top_k_reader=3)
         predictions.append((question,prediction))
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		yes, the error is still the same at the "prediction = finder.get_answers(question=question, top_k_retriever=5, top_k_reader=3)"
 argument

 		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Krak91&gt;@Krak91&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  ,
 What versions of Haystack and FARM are you using?
 The error makes me believe that you are using Haystack from latest master + FARM 0.4.6.
 These two versions are not compatible yet (we'll update to FARM 0.4.6 shortly in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pull/172&gt;#172&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  ).
 To resolve this you can do one of these options:
 
 Last stable release: pip install haystack==0.2.1
 Latest code:
 
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;git clone https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git
 cd haystack
 pip install -e .
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 (which will install FARM 0.4.5)
 Let me know if this resolves your issue!

 		Hi, I've installed the right versions of farm and haystack and it worked. Thanks.
 Some more information:
 I've noticed that all the scripts are in the 'haystack' folder of the project. As I'm just trying to add its functionality to my existing project, I simply move that folder to my virtual environment so that the imports in the scripts say valid. A few other things I've noticed:
 
 Always during installation (either by cloning or pip) it shows this error: "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.4.0 (from farm==0.4.3-&gt;farm-haystack) (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2)
 ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==1.4.0 (from farm==0.4.3-&gt;farm-haystack)'. Versions vary depending on release. Need to go install torch manually.
 I always need to modify haystack/indexing/utils line 36 whenever I install the package to avoid errors when trying to open documents with funny characters (encoding='x', errors='ignore'). I like the new functions for passing the document store raw text (dicts of title, text) rather than a physical file's path.

 This should be resolved in the latest version as we upgraded to torch 1.5.1

 Can you please elaborate on what you are exactly changing there? Are you using utf-8 encoding there? What errors come up that you want to ignore?
 As encodings are always a big pain, we could think of adding an arg to convert_files_to_dicts() to specify the encoding or at least put a better default there ...

 		I'm changing with open(path) as doc:  to with open(path, encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as doc:
 It's a unicode error:
 UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x90 in position 24072: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;

 		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Krak91&gt;@Krak91&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , this issue should be resolved by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pull/478&gt;#478&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I'm closing the thread but please feel free to update here if you still face any encoding errors.
