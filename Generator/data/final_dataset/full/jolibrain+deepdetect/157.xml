 	<summary>Output format of confusion matrix (cmfull) is confusing</summary>
 	<description>
 The cmfull output when training a network seems to have strange behavior.
 After discussing on gitter, a compact and simple proposal for the output format is as follows:
 cmfull is an object with two properties: labels and data.
 Labels is a list of strings that determine the edges of the matrix, and data as a list of lists of numbers to represent the rows, where each entry in the row corresponds to the label in the same index.
 E.g. A simple CM with 4 labels and an identity diagonal.
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;{
     "labels": ["label0", "label1", "label2", "label3"],
     "data": [
         [1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 1, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 1, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 1]
     ]
 }
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		Due to internal data structure constraints, the final format cannot exactly fit the one proposed above and discussed earlier. The new proposed format looks like:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;"cmfull":
 {
 
 }
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

            ...
    ]
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Note that the keys in the cmfull array should now always be correctly ordered.
 EDIT: fixed the post, the code is correct, the above format was not.

 		I know that this issue is of importance to some users, so I've made PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jolibrain/deepdetect/pull/158&gt;#158&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  readily available, even before discussion resumes.

 		Wait, can a JSON array have named items? I can't seem to get the example format to validate on jsonlint.

 		It's kind of hacky but how about this:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;"cmfull": [
 {"label1":[1,0,0,0]},
 {"label2":[0,1,0,0]},
 ...
 ]
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Preserve the order of rows through the array, and each row is a super simple object with label as the key and row data as value. Or, it could be even more explicit and be:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;"cmfull": [
 {
   "label": "label1",
   "data": [1,0,0,0]
 },
 {
    "label":"label2",
    "data":[0,1,0,0]
 },
 ...
 ]
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		As discussed, updated my earlier comment, the format should be fine.
