 	<summary>"full" deletion of a service leads to core dump</summary>
 	<description>
 Hello,
 I followed the tutorial "Training a model from text" (&lt;denchmark-link:http://www.deepdetect.com/tutorials/txt-training/&gt;http://www.deepdetect.com/tutorials/txt-training/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ). Creating and training the model works however, it leads to core dump when I am looking to "full" delete the service.
 Step to reproduce (assuming news20 dataset is downloaded and DeepDetect is running):
 
 Create the service (just like the tutorial and specify the model repository):
 
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/services/n20" -d "{\"mllib\":\"caffe\",\"description\":\"newsgroup classification service\",\"type\":\"supervised\",\"parameters\":{\"input\":{\"connector\":\"txt\"},\"mllib\":{\"template\":\"mlp\",\"nclasses\":20,\"layers\":[200,200],\"activation\":\"relu\"}},\"model\":{\"templates\":\"../templates/caffe/\",\"repository\":\".../data/dd_models\"}}"
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 
 Delete the service:
 
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/services/n20?clear=full"
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Result:
 ERROR - 11:52:40 - service n20 mllib internal error: Failed deleting all files in directory .../data/dd_models
 terminate called after throwing an instance of 'dd::MLLibInternalException'
 what():  Failed deleting all files in directory
 .../data/dd_models
 [1]    32215 abort (core dumped)  ./main/dede
 This does not happen when deletion is made with "lib" or "mem"

 		Doesn't crash for me... Tried with both relative and absolute path to the directory. What are the permissions on the repository and what is possibly inside ? What filesystem are on you on ?

 		After some tests I can be more specific.
 The 'dd_models' folder contains the following files and folder:
 
 deploy.prototxt
 mlp.prototxt
 mlp_solver.prototxt
 model.json
 dd_model_folder (this is a folder containing another DD model)
 
 When I try to delete model in 'dd_models' it lead to core dump only if there is sub folders containing other DD models.
 I guess this not a best practice to have sub folders of DD models :)

 		OK thanks, I'll try to reproduce FTR and to provide a fix. But yes, model directories should be managed by DD, and they do not include subdirectories other than the training and testing databases when applicable.

 		Thanks for bug report. The commit above fixes the exception catches and thus the server shall not crash anymore. However, the deletion of sub-directories within sub-directories will report a 500 error as the deletion only operates over a single depth (i.e. no recursivity). This is because in all cases, there shouldn't be the need for a repository that follows the DD structure.
