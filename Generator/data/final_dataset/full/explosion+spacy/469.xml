 	<summary>Noun chunking missing root nouns?</summary>
 	<description>
 When I run the noun chunker over the phrase "100 tacos with a side of rice" it returns "a side" and "rice" but not "100 tacos".
 The word "tacos" has the dependency label (dep_) of "ROOT". I think the problem may be that english_noun_chunks in spacy.syntax.iterators has 'root' as lowercase. See line 5
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;labels = ['nsubj', 'dobj', 'nsubjpass', 'pcomp', 'pobj',
               'attr', 'root']
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 When I add 'ROOT' to labels it works as expected and returns "100 tacos". Of course, there may be a reason that 'root' is different from 'ROOT' that I am not aware of.

 		I put in the change and the test, but when I try to build locally with  I get the error listed at &lt;denchmark-link:http://9.media.readthedocs.io/projects/spacy/builds/3893054/&gt;http://9.media.readthedocs.io/projects/spacy/builds/3893054/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 		Broken build is sadness — I want to make sure this doesn't happen in future.
 Anyway. The problem is fixed for 1.0. Thanks again for the report.
