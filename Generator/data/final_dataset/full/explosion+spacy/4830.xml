 	<summary>spaCy CLI NER fails after several epochs: ValueError: [E024]</summary>
 	<description>
 I am CLI-training a NER model, however, after 3-4 epochs, it crashes with the following error:

 ValueError: [E024] Could not find an optimal move to supervise the parser. Usually, this means that the model can't be updated in a way that's valid and satisfies the correct annotations specified in the GoldParse. For example, are all labels added to the model? If you're training a named entity recognizer, also make sure that none of your annotated entity spans have leading or trailing whitespace. You can also use the experimental debug-data command to validate your JSON-formatted training data. For details, run:                     python -m spacy debug-data --help
 
 I've run debug-data, and no problems were occurred with NER model (no white spaces). Moreover, Parser is not being trained, but only ner. It is also a bit strange, as it crashes after several successful epochs, so the model is capable of learning from data, but then something is happening and then it crashes. Very strange. Thanks in advance.

 		That is indeed quite strange. Which exact command are you using to start the training? Can you share the output of the first epochs ?
 Just FYI: the NER algorithm is implemented in a similar fashion as the parser, both use a Transition-based system. That's why the error mentions "parser" even though you're training NER - so that is not strange by itself (though admittedly a bit confusing)

 		Hi Sofie, it is a fairly straightforward way:
 (spacy) kormilitzin@dataCentre_1stRackFromBottom:/mnt/sdf/andrey_work/projects/med_mimic$ python -m spacy train en ./med7_20DEC_default_40_itr ./data/train_test/train/_med7_train.json ./data/train_test/test/_med7_test.json -b ./med7_20DEC_default/model40 -p ner -nl 0.2 -n 200 
 Where /med7_20DEC_default/model40is the previous model where spaCy had crashed. So I basically continue training from where it crashed before.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20815939/71384136-89e67680-25d7-11ea-9927-ec8ec1348bc0.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 However, as you can see, I put 200 iterations and the model completed only 21 and then crashed. This is the reason I started training with the basis model the one where it stopped previously. I used both, GPU and CPU and the results remain the same. Could it be memory problems?
 Also, the model crashed even if I start with blank en model and en_vectors_web_lg, after 40 iterations it crashed.

 		UPDATE Once I stopped using nl option (--noise-level) it works as a charm without crash. I'm not sure whether they are related, but this simple observations now helps me to train as long as I need.

 		So it appears this happens because of this function &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/gold.pyx#L480&gt;https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/gold.pyx#L480&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  which is called when the noise level is turned on. It basically swaps punctuation for newlines at random, and that could become a problem when the swapped text is part of an annotated entity. This definitely looks like a bug and something we should fix - but training without noise in the meantime is a good work-around.
