 		Seems using SELECT crim,zn,indus,chas,nox,rm,age,medv FROM boston.train TO TRAIN... can solve this problem. And this leads to another enhancement:
 We need to log that which columns are used for training in the notebook so that we would not confuse about what fields are actually used by the training.
