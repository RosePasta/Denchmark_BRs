 	<summary>Segmentation fault when ImageAcquisitionManager is created and quit() is called in interpreter</summary>
 	<description>
 Describe the bug
 When Harvester is initialized and ImageAcquisitionManager is created, exiting the interpreter causes a segmentation fault.
 To Reproduce
 Simply the following code in the interpreter will do:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from harvesters.core import Harvester
 &gt;&gt;&gt; h = Harvester()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; h.add_cti_file("/path/to/cti_file")
 &gt;&gt;&gt; h.update_device_info_list()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; iam = h.create_image_acquisition_manager(0)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; quit()
 Segmentation fault
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Expected behavior
 Python interpreter should be able exit without the segmentation fault.
 Desktop (please complete the following information):
 
 OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4

 		Hi Severi,
 Thank you for the report. Could you tell me which version of Harvester Core did you use?
 PS. I'll privately reply tomorrow to the message that you recently sent to me! Thanks!

 		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kazunarikudo&gt;@kazunarikudo&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 !
 I'm using version 0.post0.dev615. I also noticed that the interpreter sometimes exits with words
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;pure virtual method called
 terminate called without an active exception
 Aborted
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 instead of Segmentation fault.

 		Thank you for making a try! If you don't see the segfault it should be the change that I made for issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/issues/40&gt;#40&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . And yes, I also saw  just a couple of hours ago when I closed the Harvester GUI. Of course, calling pure virutal method is absolutely wrong so there must be something wrong with the design and I would have to investigate it anyway. By the way, you told me "...". Do you mean it's literally sometimes but not always?

 Yes, most of the time the interpreter exits with just Segmentation fault.

 		Okay, so could you please upgrade the Harvester Core and check the situation doesn't change. The latest version is 615. You should be able to upgrade it just typing pip install -U harvesters.

 		It's not necessary to try today but I would like to introduce you how to log the execution of Harvester. I'll attach a logging configuration file but please assume you have already got the file and its name is logging.report.ini. Just copying the file, you will tell Harvester the location where the configuration file is located using an environment variable HARVESTER_LOGGING_CONFIG. To setup the environment variable, just type export HARVESTER_LOGGING_CONFIG=path/to/logging.report.ini. Then you launch your interpreter. In the meantime, you'll see logging messages every code execution. I'll show you a block that I excepted from the example code you introduced.

 		Unfortunately, I have not seen any segmentation fault on Ubuntu or macOS but you would able to reproduce the phenomenon and we could find a clue in the logging message.

 (This file has been zipped because GitHub does not support pasting *.ini file; you'll have to unzip it before you use.)
 Please note that you should remove the environment variable typing unset HARVESTER_LOGGING_CONFIG after the investigation. Otherwise, Harvester will keep growing a log file (it's named harvester.log by default) and I know it's not good for you! ;-)

 		Please excuse me, I had inject a bug at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/commit/53b92260c4d2cc30d8563b0460b4279f6c246a2d&gt;53b9226&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  which crashes Harvester while it's connecting a camera but it's been fixed at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/commit/d05f7d9d2c6f039d87832f6890c54bd07dc5f57a&gt;d05f7d9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Having the latest version, you should be able to log without worries!

 		Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/severij&gt;@severij&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  , I have committed a change at &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/commit/e326309dbb041d384146ab742f3413b5b1530507&gt;e326309&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  and I expect the change fixes the issue you are facing. Please let me know if it didn't work for you. Or please feel free to close this issue once you confirmed it worked. In addition, I have changed an identifier from  to  (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/issues/49&gt;#49&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  about the detail). So you would code as follows:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from harvesters.core import Harvester
 &gt;&gt;&gt; h = Harvester()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; h.add_cti_file('/path/to/cti_file')
 &gt;&gt;&gt; h.update_device_info_list()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; ia = h.create_image_acquirer(0)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; quit()
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 I'm sorry having broken the compatibility. -Kazunari

 I can confirm that your commit indeed has fixed the issue. üëç Thank you!
 
 I have changed an identifier from ImageAcquisitionManager to ImageAcquirer ... I'm sorry having broken the compatibility.
 
 No worries, it was just a small fix. :)
