 	<summary>training-accuracy nan</summary>
 	<description>
 When I was training using my own dataset, the training accuracy was shown to be nan when in epoch 8N-1(e.g. epoch 7, 15,23,31....). This makes me feel puzzled....
 Also, in the example &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks/blob/master/python/how_to/finetune.ipynb&gt;https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks/blob/master/python/how_to/finetune.ipynb&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , the training accuracy falls to be nan in epoch 6. I was wondering how did this happen?

 		because when called get() for a metric, the count is 0, which is often due to reset() is called. it  doesn't not affect model, but sometime annoying.

 		The "Epoch[x] Train-accuracy=xxx" line printed at the end of every epoch gives the impression that the accuracy metric is for the entire epoch. In reality, it is NOT.
 For example if an epoch consists of 101 batches and we were printing metrics every 10 batch because callback was created that way, what will be printed as 'Train-accuracy=xxx' at the end of an epoch is actually just the accuracy from a single batch (101'st batch). Printing this as 'Epoch[x] Train-accuracy=xxx' is very misleading.
 Ideally we should remove &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/62bf9ec16886434d5e4eac279db19cb18c5c9c45/python/mxnet/module/base_module.py#L535&gt;this&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  misleading print statement. But then, I'm sure there is a lot of existing scripts out there that look for this statement. We can't remove this without breaking those scripts. Since this will be a breaking change, let's do it in a major version change.
 For now, to avoid the nan error, we can avoid resetting the metrics when processing callback for the last batch. It will be reset at the beginning of the next epoch anyway.
