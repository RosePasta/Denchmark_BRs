 	<summary>Single Unit Test for One Shot Object Detection Takes Longer than Ten Minutes</summary>
 	<description>
 The following unit test consistently takes longer than ten minutes: test_one_shot_object_detector.py::OneObjectDetectorSmokeTest::test_export_coreml
 Having no progress (i.e. output) for 10 minutes causes Travis CI to fail. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/2036/checks?check_run_id=144613002&gt;Here is an example of such a failure where all three Python build failed&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . This is currently breaking Travis CI builds of master.
 I think there are three possible solutions:
 1 - Don't run One Shot Unit Tests in Travis CI. We're already not running unit tests for object detection and style transfer (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/1031&gt;#1031&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ).
 2 - Speed up the one shot unit tests.
 3 - We could experiment with the  command. This may allow us to get around this problem but I believe we wouldn't be able to see an intermediate output for builds.
 I think in the short term we should go with the first solution. Although in the long term I think the second solution is the best. Thoughts?
