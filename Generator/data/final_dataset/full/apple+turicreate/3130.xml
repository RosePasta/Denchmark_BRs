 		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/pradeek232662&gt;@pradeek232662&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I have assigned the issue to you.
 I just noticed that tc.version_info.build_number is also not getting set.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/ea8873d6fa597d4a9f9a26db3c8e4540eba7efbd/scripts/make_wheel.sh#L360&gt;Here is where the git_sha should be getting set&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . A &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/ea8873d6fa597d4a9f9a26db3c8e4540eba7efbd/scripts/make_wheel.sh#L354&gt;couple of lines above that&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  is where the build number should be getting set.
 I strongly suspect both problems where introduced when we moved to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/psf/black&gt;black&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  style formatting. I think the fix here will be very similar to &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/pull/3077&gt;#3077&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .
