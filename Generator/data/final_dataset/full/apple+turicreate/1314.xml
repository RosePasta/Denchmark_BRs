 	<summary>Object Detector deployed to Vision framework unexpectedly yields confidences at 0.999</summary>
 	<description>
 I've observed that training and exporting an object detector, and integrating into the Vision sample code &lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  yields confidences very close to 1. Training and exporting a model with the same data but without NMS yields confidences that span the range from 0 to 1 (after tweaking the sample code just to output the single highest-confidence box).
 Our docs describe NMS as a filtering mechanism; we don't expect any "merging" of confidence scores. So there appears to be an error in either the docs, the CoreML implementation, or the Vision integration.

 		It turns out the issue is not due to non-maximum suppression,
 instead it is due to the fact that the sample code for Object Detection provided by Apple
 (&lt;denchmark-link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture&gt;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/recognizing_objects_in_live_capture&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 )
 shows a 'normalized' confidence which enforces scores across all classes sum to 1,
 which produce confidence near 1 for the predicted class.
 If you want to get the original confidence score for the predicted class,
 please refer to VNRecognizedObjectObservation.confidence instead.
