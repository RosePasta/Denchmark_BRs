 	<summary>model.save() is silently failing if there's a tilde in the path</summary>
 	<description>
 It seems that model.save() for the AC (and maybe other models??) is not working, and also doesn't produce any error.
 The following code:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;model = tc.activity_classifier.create(train, session_id, target ,features=features,
                                       prediction_window=50, validation_set=test ,max_iterations=10)
 model.save("~/Temp/ilai.model")
 del model
 new_model = tc.load_model("~/Temp/ilai.model")
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 ends up with:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;IOError: Directory ~/Temp/ilai.model does not exist
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		Apparently that was a problem with "~" in the path.
 With an absolute path to home dir - it does seem to work.
 But we should still raise some alarm. This went on silently and I could have completely missed the fact that the model didn't save.

 		The model is being save: the save path is passed without validation into the C++ backend, which treats '~' as a literal path component. On the load side, we have Python code that verifies the existence of the directory at the path; this Python code is presumably performing the tilde expansion
