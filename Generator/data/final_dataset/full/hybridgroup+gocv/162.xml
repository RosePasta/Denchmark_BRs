 	<summary>Make fail on ubuntu 17.10</summary>
 	<description>
 Hi
 make install fails on ubuntu 17.10 and fallback to fedora(?) dnf install. I do know if would make sense to handle this also for ubuntu 18 which is going to  be released
 Also  is unavaliable in ubuntu after 17.04
 A workaround is here &lt;denchmark-link:https://stackoverflow.com/a/48326450/833499&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/48326450/833499&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main"
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install libjasper-dev
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Thanks!

 		I think disabling jpeg2000 support in opencv is a saner solution (nobody uses this format) than modifying the host's apt configuration to fetch from old releases (and not a backport proper).
 Testing locally with sudo apt remove libjasper-dev then doing a full rebuild with WITH_JASPER=OFF

 		Yes I agree, your solution is saner definitely!

 make deps_fedora
 sudo: dnf: command not found
 Makefile:32: recipe for target 'deps_fedora' failed

 		With 18.04 the Makefile seems to think the system is Fedora..... allthought it seems the commands the Makefile uses are still returing correclty.  I was able to modifiy it,and removed the install of of jasper-dev, now stuck on
 /sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libhidapi-libusb.so.0 is not a symbolic link
 /sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/local/lib/libhidapi-hidraw.so.0 is not a symbolic link
 /sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib/libhidapi-libusb.so.0 is not a symbolic link
 /sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib/libhidapi-hidraw.so.0 is not a symbolic link
 comes up for both make deps, and make build
