 	<summary>Profile controller uses project id from user sa for identity namespace</summary>
 	<description>
 /kind bug
 What steps did you take and what happened:
 We have teams in different gcp projects are using a shared Kubeflow cluster.  When I try to use a gcp service account from a different project for gcpServiceAccount field in a user's profile, profile-controller throws an error:
 Identity namespace does not exist (${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog)
 It seems the project id used in identity namespace is inferred from user's gcp service account. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/profile-controller/controllers/plugin_workload_identity.go#L54&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/components/profile-controller/controllers/plugin_workload_identity.go#L54&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 What did you expect to happen:
 I think it might make more sense to use the id of the project where Kubeflow cluster was created in.
 Anything else you would like to add:
 [Miscellaneous information that will assist in solving the issue.]
 Environment:
 
 Kubeflow version: (version number can be found at the bottom left corner of the Kubeflow dashboard):
 kfctl version: (use kfctl version): 0.7.1
 Kubernetes platform: (e.g. minikube): GKE
 Kubernetes version: (use kubectl version): v1.14.8-gke.33
 OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): mac OS Mojave v10.14.6

 		I don't know that we will fix this issue.
 Per &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/1136&gt;kubeflow/manifests#1136&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  I think we are moving away from profiles and bootstrapping namespaces using GitOps and declarative packages.
 We are also moving to using Cloud Config Connector.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/gcp-blueprints&gt;https://github.com/kubeflow/gcp-blueprints&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 So in this new world if you wanted to configure which GCP service account is bound to a KSA you would just modify the K8s resource and if necessary create an IAMPolicyMember to grant the appropriate workload identity on the GCP SA.

 		Tha's OK. We currently use a fork of profile controller (with the fix) as the workaround.
 We will need some migration after Kubeflow deprecates profile in the future, but it should be fine.

 		Removing from 1.1 because I don't think anyone is working on it.

 		Hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jlewi&gt;@jlewi&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , the fix I made has already been merged in master with this PR &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4754&gt;#4754&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . I think we just need to publish a new image and update the deployment manifest. Will that be automatically taken care of in Kubeflow 1.1 release so we can remove our fork? Let me know if there's anything I can help with.
