 	<summary>Notebook Images : Change owner to jovyan of /home/jovyan</summary>
 	<description>
 /kind bug
 We create the home directory /home/jovyan here
 
 
 
 kubeflow/components/tensorflow-notebook-image/Dockerfile
 
 
          Line 90
       in
       296bf14
 
 
 
 
 
 
  mkdir -p $HOME 
 
 
 
 
 
 but we don't change the owner and group to be jovyan and users respectively.
 When using the docker image with Kubeflow notebooks that doesn't matter because we end up overwriting /home/jovyan with a volume that will have user and group set correctly.
 However it can lead to unexpected behavior when people use the image directly; e.g. as the base image with func_to_container_op.

  I believe this is already fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/4867&gt;#4867&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 I believe we still need to build updated docker images and then update the configmap on master to use them.

 		This might not make it into 1.1 as the continuous builds &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/4789&gt;#4789&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  is still in the works.
