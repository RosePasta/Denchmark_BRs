 	<summary>PR template contains checkboxes that are never checked</summary>
 	<description>
 Describe the bug
 The PR template contains a bunch of check-boxes that never get checked, which makes open PRs appear unfinished.
 
 Look at the Pull Requests tab and verify that completed PRs show progress like "1 of 7": &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/pulls&gt;https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/pulls&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 Expected behavior
 Finished PRs should show all tasks checked off. Specific tasks from the contributing guidelines should be listed in the checklist so that people can verify that they've done them without having to read the whole set of guidelines. The type of PR (new feature, bug fix, refactor, breaking change) should be identified with labels instead of check-boxes.
