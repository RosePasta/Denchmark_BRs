 	<summary>Update local testing documentation</summary>
 	<description>
 Describe the bug
 Update the documentation on how to test jina.
 Current used testing framework is not unittest, it is pytest. Plus to run some tests, a test docker image must be built.
 docker build --build-arg PIP_TAG="[devel]" -f Dockerfiles/pip.Dockerfile -t jinaai/jina:test-pip .
 pip install pytest
 pip install pytest-xdist
 pip install pytest-timeout
 pip install pytest-cov
 pytest --cov=jina --cov-report=xml -n 1 --timeout=60 -v tests/unit

 Shall we make a README.md under the tests folder and put this information there?
 
 Seems like a good idea to me

 		Hello &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Curious-Ujjwal&gt;@Curious-Ujjwal&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  ,
 Sure, it is still a good idea to work on this issue for new contributors to know how to run the tests as the CI does.
 You can look at how we use pytest in our CI and write a README.md for it under tests folder stating that we have unit and integration tests
