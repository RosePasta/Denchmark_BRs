 	<summary>npm start fails if conda not available</summary>
 	<description>
 Although it is preferred to use conda, it would be good to be able to run deepforge without it. Of course, dependencies would need to be already installed and would not be able to be automatically installed. Currently, running  results in the following error:

 		I guess this actually is the same as auto-detecting conda support (since we already have support for the -N flag).

 		That's why I added the comment about auto-detecting conda support (since the underlying capability is already there). :)
 Basically, it can be a little annoying that npm start fails when conda is not available. It would be nice to either detect this and print a meaningful error message or print a warning and run without conda support.

 		This specific error is caused by activate not being found in the PATH. In my case, adding ~/anaconda/bin/ to my PATH fixed it:
 export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/anaconda3/bin
