 	<summary>Test failure in runtest.py SerializationTest.testPassingArgumentsByValue.</summary>
 	<description>
 I just saw this test failure, which caused runtest.py to hang.
 Cloudpickle just pushed a new release 0.4.0, so it's probably related to that.

 		I can reproduce this on Ubuntu 16 with Anaconda Python 2.7 by running the following.

 		The problem can be reproduced more easily (without Ray) as follows.
 from collections import namedtuple
 import cloudpickle
 
 Point = namedtuple("Point", ["x", "y"])
 
 s = cloudpickle.dumps(Point)
 cloudpickle.loads(s)
 This gives the error

 		&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/834&gt;#834&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  pins cloudpickle to 0.3.0 in the Travis tests, which should fix the test failures.

 		Closing for now, since the test failure was fixed by &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/834&gt;#834&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , though people with the latest cloudpickle will still run into this problem.
