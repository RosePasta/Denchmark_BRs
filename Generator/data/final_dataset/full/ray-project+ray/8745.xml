 	<summary>[Dashboard] Dashboard doesn't receive pub/sub messages anymore.</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Ray dashboard doesn't update its actor information because it doesn't receive its pub/sub messages from Redis anymore.
 Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
 latest Ray
 MacOS
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
 Create an actor after dashboard is started and see dashboard.

  I think Python code is tightly coupled with Redis for now, and it causes some unexpected errors from random places after it started using GCS pubsub. Could you make sure when you merge GCS PRs that it passes all Python tests? (I know some tests are flakey, but please make sure to run them locally and verify they are indeed flakey) Also, please add one of us to reviewers for GCS PR (so that we can hopefully catch Python erros)! Thank you!!

  I took a look at this issue for some time, and it seems like the issue is that this pubsub is not working anymore. 
 
 It seems like it was origianlly available from table.cc, but GCS table doesn't support this table publication yet in a glance? Can you take a look at the issue?
