 	<summary>[Tests] Format script does not error when libraries are not installed</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 If flake8-comprehensions and flake8-quotes libraries are not installed, then running ci/travis/format.sh does not make the necessary checks. The script should give instructions on how to install the necessary libraries if they are not already installed.
 Ray version and other system information (Python version, TensorFlow version, OS):
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Reproduction (REQUIRED)&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Please provide a script that can be run to reproduce the issue. The script should have no external library dependencies (i.e., use fake or mock data / environments):
 Run ci/travis/format.sh
 If we cannot run your script, we cannot fix your issue.
 
  I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
  I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 		My PR only checks flake8. I believe flake-8-quotes should be also written, and not sure about flake8-comprehensions (since I didn't see this depedency was required when I was setting up)
