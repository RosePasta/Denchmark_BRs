 	<summary>[tune] A worker dies after 1000 samples</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;What is the problem?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Workers crash while testing the Hyperopt example script: &lt;denchmark-link:https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/examples/hyperopt_example.html&gt;https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/examples/hyperopt_example.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  on a larger number of samples with fewer steps. The modified version of the script is attached below. The only changes are reducing the number of steps from 100 to 10 (for reaching the issue faster) and increasing the number of samples from 1000 to 10000. The worker crashes happen just beyond the 1000 samples, but at no fixed point.
 The following error message appears when a worker crashes:

 The main job does not crash but is stuck when all workers are dead. Killing the main job via keyboard results in:

  with the only change being the num_samples increase to 10000 and the steps decrease to 10.
 Save the script as test.py and run python test.py. Expect the workers to start crashing after about 1000 samples. The point at which they crash is not exactly reproducible. However, they fact that they crash is reproducible. I was never able to complete a full run over 10000 sample and on my setup they tend to crash between 1000 and 2000 samples (trials). For example, in the last attempt the workers started crashing just after I saw the message .. 1091 more trials not shown (1091 TERMINATED) on screen.
 
  I have verified my script runs in a clean environment and reproduces the issue.
  I have verified the issue also occurs with the latest wheels.

 		Interesting, maybe the GCS is not cleaning up connections to actors that have died? That would explain why it only happens after a large number of samples (unique actors created).
 If this is true, it should be reproducible just by creating a bunch of actors and removing them.

  How do you start you cluster? When you start can you run with this command? 
 or if you just use ray.init, ulimit -c unlimited; python ...

  to test if the lack of connections cleanup is the culprit do you have any suggestions on a small test I could run?

 The job memory usage doubles at this point and it remains in that locked status until I kill it. Interestingly, the gcs_server.err file still shows the same:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ cat /tmp/ray/session_2020-10-16_18-34-01_829650_62922/logs/gcs_server.err
 E1016 18:34:57.824522905   62941 tcp_server_posix.cc:213]    Failed accept4: Too many open files
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Maybe it has to do with the file descriptors limit? This the ulimit -a command output is as follows:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;$ ulimit -a
 -t: cpu time (seconds)              unlimited

 		Yeah I think ulimit -c unlimited should allow the unlimited number of open file desc (but based on your help CLI, it is probably -n). Maybe you can instead try ulimit -n 65000; ray start...

 		ah yeah. I can see you have 1024 fd limit! I think the root cause is we probably don't properly clean up connections, but this might help you mitigate issues without fixing the root cause

  I was able to get through the initial crash via , thank you for the suggestion.
 The job slows down tremendously after the first few thousand samples. Is that expected from Hyperopt or could this be a consequence of the root cause?
 I noticed this in the output:

 The port listed under loc keeps increasing. Is this normal or is it related to the lack of cleanup? I wonder if this may cause a slowdown in the processing. The first 1000 samples run in about one minute. However, to reach 9000 it took more than two hours.
 A sample of the same output for the first 1000 samples is:

 		In this latest run the gcs_server.err is empty, as expected. The gcs_server.out still shows the following:

 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 talks about a worker failure and the next line about intentional exit. Is this expected?

 		That intentional exit is misleading. I will fix the issue. It should be intentional exit : True / False. I think what's happening is one of your nodes is dead in the middle. Did you see any logs from gcs_server that your node is dead?

 		This actually seems really easy to reproduce. I haven't seen this issue from Tune before, but going to 10k samples can probably cause some problems.

  Is it possible for the Tune team to take this over and confirm the issue is not related to Tune itself first?

 		I'm also suffering from this "Couldn't reconnect to GCS server. The last attempted GCS server address was ..." error. In my case, I'm using hyperopt as well. In some cases the errors start at just over 500 trials out of a planned 2,500 trials. The program gets to the first 500 trials in a few minutes and then keeps running forever without completing any other trials before I have to kill it. Also I am not using a cluster, everything is being run on a single machine.

  since this seems to be confirmed to be a GCS connection leak , is Kai still the right person to work on it?

  So, my understanding / hypothesis here is the initial error was due to a connection leak, but the following errors (&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/11309#issuecomment-710726509&gt;#11309 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ) are just due to Tune? (Or it could be that gcs server is not stable when there are so many actors, but I'd like to make sure it is not a Tune issue before I dig deeper into it)

 		<comment id='21' author='demattia' date='2020-10-20T01:07:57Z'>
 		I'm not sure any errors after the initial one make sense to look into--- once we run out of file descriptors, anything could happen.

  I re-ran another job since the error and that gcs_server.err file has been overwritten. I'll post that log when it happens again though.

 		I've managed to reproduce the error with this simplified script: &lt;denchmark-link:https://gist.github.com/ericl/73dfd011a5c592e65bae66e6fab52052&gt;https://gist.github.com/ericl/73dfd011a5c592e65bae66e6fab52052&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 with ulimit -n 2000
 0.8.5 -&gt; works
 0.8.6 -&gt; works
 0.8.7 -&gt; fails
 1.0 -&gt; fails
 So it's pretty clearly tied to GCS actor manager on by default. Looking into how to fix next.

 		After more investigation, I don't believe this is really a leak of gRPC clients (I added constructor/destructor logging hooks and the number of gRPC clients remains bounded, and we seem to be cleaning up properly in all cases).
 I believe that what's going on is there are a large number of connections stuck closing in TIME_WAIT state: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/3855&gt;grpc/grpc#3855&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  This means that after an actor is destroyed, the sockets used for communicating with it may be active for up to 120s: &lt;denchmark-link:https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux&gt;https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  There are some kernel options to recycle sockets, but I didn't have much success trying them.
 Since 1.0 is managing actors from the GCS server, this at least doubles the number of connections per actor: you need one from the driver-&gt;actor, and another from the GCS-&gt;actor. We also seem to be opening more than 1 connection in the GCS, so the overall number of sockets is now 2-3x it was before, bumping into FD limits.
 I'm not sure the best solution for this, but probably increasing the ulimit is the way to go in the short term.

 		Btw, I've also observed Tune getting pretty slow with a large number of finished trials (&gt;2000). I guess this is a separate bug, please open another issue for it to track.

 		Thanks &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ericl&gt;@ericl&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  and everyone for your help. The ulimit increase indeed seems to solve the issue for now. &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/richardliaw&gt;@richardliaw&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  I will try the reuse_actors=True at the next chance, thanks for the suggestion. I will follow the slowdown on &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/11233&gt;#11233&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  as that is the next bottleneck.
