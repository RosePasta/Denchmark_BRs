 	<summary>BUG Encoding issues</summary>
 	<description>
 I'm getting encoding issues when trying to build the docs (on my laptop [Ubuntu], but not on my desktop [CentOS]). Looks like the reason is that someone has accents in their name...
 One solution would be to explicitly define the source files to be UTF-8 (which they are, from what I understand). Another would be to remove the accents.

 		Right, I think that the necessary header is
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python
 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		Yes, but for one (two?) stinking accents in two files (scattering1d.py and setup.py)? For setup.py, sure, since that exports to PyPI, but for the rest, it seems overkill.
 I suggest removing accents in scattering1d.py and adding the encoding to setup.py.

 		To clarify, "overkill" because if we do it to scattering1d.py, we should be consistent and have it in all source files. setup.py is "different" enough that we can have a different format for it.
