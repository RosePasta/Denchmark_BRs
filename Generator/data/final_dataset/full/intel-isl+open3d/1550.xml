 	<summary>Point Cloud visualization GLFW Error</summary>
 	<description>
 Hello everyone,
 I've been using Open3D 0.7.0 for a while now, playing with point clouds...
 I visualize my pointclouds with open3d.visualization.draw_geometries
 Often when I move the point clouds in the window I get this error:
 [Open3D Error] GLFW Error: Failed to make context current
 even with having this error printed in the console, I could keep working and moving around the point cloud with no issues
 Now, I updated my Open3D to version 0.9.0 and the error is shutting down my script... so now I cannot move and visualize the point cloud as I'd like, it still shows me the point cloud, but as soon as I start moving it, it shuts my program...
 Is there a fix for this? maybe I have to install or upgrade some other library?
 Thanks!

 		Hi, Could you try to install dependencies using the scripts &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/tree/master/util/scripts&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  and build from source?

 		Hello! Same problem here. The same script I'm using now, was working a week ago, with the only difference that I was not getting any error in the console (as far as I remember correctly).
 Win 10, Python 3.7.6 (64bit) and Open3D 0.9.0

 		nope， I'm using it in pycharm, I set GPU to NVIDIA's card and the problem haven't occur so far.

 This is the code:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;pcd  = o3d.io.read_point_cloud('pcd.ply')
 
 print(np.asarray(pcd.points).shape)
 print(np.asarray(pcd.colors).shape)
 
 o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd])
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 No, I'm using Visual Studio Code.
 Sometimes it crashes with the same error, sometimes it works..
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/ZhangLanTao&gt;@ZhangLanTao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  how did you switch to the Nvidia GPU?

 you can refer to issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/issues/1598&gt;#1598&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , It works on my PC.

 Using pycharm with python 3.7

 		Using a good independent Graphics card that supports openGL is an effective solution.

 		Well, I could do that for me. But Im developping an application to deploy in many computers the solution should be more generalistic. Maybe try different version combinations of python and opend3D? Anyone with no independent graphics card working in Windows with no issues?

 		Hi. Like Felipe mentions in the original post, the error is happening in Open3D versions prior to 0.9 as well, but it was failing silently in the  background. Since 0.9  the whole visualizer throws an error and shuts down.
 On the screenshot below, you can see console print outs for running same script with 0.8 and 0.10.0.1 version.
 On the left, GLFW fails several times. The errors are logged, but I was able to continue to use the visualizer (zoom, rotate, etc.) and without the log, I would have not noticed anything.
 On the right, the script shuts down with the first error.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29164793/96128732-05623d00-0ef6-11eb-875d-0e8916b8b1c2.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 I am not sure if this error handling change was deliberate decision or if it is even coming from Open3D code, but since I have a laptop with only internal GPU, the suggested workaround does not work for me and I would appreciate reverting back to the silent fails in background.

  We deliberately changed error logging to throw an exception if the severity is high enough which is why your script no longer continues past the first error. I will investigate if the error could safely be reported as a warning instead.

  Please try latest master. GLFW errors are now logged as warnings so they don't force the program to quit.

  Can confirm that the behavior is the same as with 0.8. Thank you!

 		Yes, the behavior is the same with respect to the logging. GLFW errors are logged to the console but don't stop the program just like in 0.8.

 @FelipeDelgadoR @morejiik @ZhangLanTao How did you use draw_geometries? Are you using in Jupyter Notebook?
 
 Hello, I am using Jupyter notebook to visualize a .ply file with open3d and get the message:
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62543957/101012007-0b25e780-3563-11eb-9723-ff10d64fda62.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 I know it may not be the same exact problem but I was wondering if you would have any ideas on what I could do to fix it?
 Thanks!!

 		I was having the same issue from time to time.
 I have followed this step:
 
 Go to Nvidia Control Panel &gt; Manage 3d settings &gt; select preferred graphics processor. By default you can see auto-select. Change it to your desired GPU.
 
 and it seems to work now. Give it a try
