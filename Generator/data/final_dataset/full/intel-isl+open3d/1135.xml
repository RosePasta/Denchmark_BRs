 	<summary>Build from source fails because of libjpeg_turbo.cmake on some Linux based OS</summary>
 	<description>
 I do not manage to build the current master from source because of an issue with libjpeg_turbo.cmake. In order to reproduce the error you would have to clone the repo, create a build folder, go to that folder and call cmake .. &amp; make.
 My system is Fedora 27, but I assume it is an issue with Linux in general, I assume it might work on other platforms.
 When I build the current master, make crashes with the following error message:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;make[2]: *** No rule to make target '3rdparty_install/lib/libturbojpeg.a', needed by 'bin/ConvertPointCloud'.  Stop.
 make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1309: src/Tools/CMakeFiles/ConvertPointCloud.dir/all] Error 2
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 I managed to compile Open3D by changing line 70 in 3rdparty/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo.cmake from
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;    ${3RDPARTY_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/${CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX}${lib_name}${CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX}
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 to
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;${3RDPARTY_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib64/${CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX}${lib_name}${CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX}
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 (change of lib to lib64).
 I assume that this would break the build on other system such as windows.
