 	<summary>Why does the README not suggest to pass lm and trie files?</summary>
 	<description>
 From the README:
 
 deepspeech models/output_graph.pb models/alphabet.txt my_audio_file.wav
 
 Why does this not suggest to also pass models/lm.binary and models/trie?
 I get much better accuracry when those are passed, compare:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;tearest creature in creation stydy englich pronunciation i wul teacher in my verse sounds like corps cor hors and worse
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 to
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;dearest creature in creation study english pronunciation i will teach you in my verse sounds like corps core horse and worse
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Putting the files into the README instructions might make for a much better first impression when people try DeepSpeech.

  Patches are welcome, it's likely that we are used to doing so, and the command line documents it, so we forgot to update the README on that specific point.
