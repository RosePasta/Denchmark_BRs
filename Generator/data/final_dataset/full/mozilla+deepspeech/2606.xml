 	<summary>Windows 10 might require "Redistribuable Visual C++ 2015 Update 3" for runtime (NodeJS)</summary>
 	<description>
 
 OS Platform and Distribution: Windows 10 (64bit)
 DeepSpeech package: deepspeech (npm)
 DeepSpeech version: 0.6.0
 Node version: 13.0.1
 Sample code: https://gist.github.com/slaypni/695df46d55fcae159105d99fe96b99d8
 Exact command to reproduce: yarn; node main.js
 
 It seems using deepspeech node client fails on Windows. An error is produced as follows when trying to run:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;&gt; node main.js
 internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1041
   return process.dlopen(module, path.toNamespacedPath(filename));
                  ^
 
 Error: A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed.

 I don't know well enough Windows, but deepspeech.node should load libdeepspeech.so. Somehow, it is failing :/

  It looks like you need "Redistribuable Visual C++ 2015 Update 3 (64 bits)" to be installed. Can you try from this link ?
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/details.aspx?id=53840&gt;https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/details.aspx?id=53840&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 Only select the  package. It was enough to get  for me. I'm not sure how we should handle that, I don't know well enough Windows' world.

 @lissyx Thank you for finding a solution. I installed the specified version of vc_redist.x64.exe and tried to run deepspeech, however, the same error occured again.
 
 That's weird, I verified several times with install / uninstall of it, and I would constantly reproduce / fix the issue. That should not be needed, but have you restarted between tests ? It could be possible that the path is not yet updated.
 At that point, maybe you lack some other dep, but it seems like Windows is a bit a moving target, this is not something we had to do before.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/slaypni&gt;@slaypni&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  What's your exact Windows version ? Maybe you need other versions of  as well ?

 Are the only ones missing after uninstalling the redistribuable package. Please check on your side as well ?

  I confirmed all DLLs used from  exist by using &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies&gt;Dependencies&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 Although it also shows deepspeech.node has one missing module libdeepspeech.so, I am not sure if it is a problem.
 
 Check index.js we are supposed to force PATH to ensure that libdeepspeech.so is properly found. It's possible you need to add the path containing it to Dependencies' config.

  Configuring Dependencies' search path enabled to find  as you said. Currently I am copying  onto the current directly (and also a directly under PATH), therefore it should be found on runtime, however, it fails to run. I am wondering if the error is really caused by missing DLLs.

 Are you sure that your Node process has the same PATH ? There should be no need to move the library, please avoid this as it's going to make debugging even more difficult.

 I confirmed all DLLs used from libdeepspeech.so exist by using Dependencies. (Dependency Walker seems not working on my Windows.)
 
 Please re-verify everything. I just checked with this tools, and it indeeds finds the missing redistribuable libs from its own directory. Obviously, not a directory that is known by Node process.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/slaypni&gt;@slaypni&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  On the installed module, can you hack into  and add some  statement to know about  before and after we compute it ?

 		Hello,
 Just tested and it is working for me, the thing is that I have literally all the redistributable versions installed, at the moment I can't remove them to confirm.
 What comes to my mind for now to mitigate the unknown source of the issue is to check that the redistributable is installed by using the regedit key:
 something like:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;var regedit = require('regedit')
 
 regedit.list('HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\14.0\\VC\\Runtimes\\x64', function(err, result) {
      console.log(result['HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\14.0\\VC\\Runtimes\\x64'].values['Version'])
 })
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 We need to check from 10.0 to 15.9 and see if at least one is installed(instead of only 14.0)
 If the Runtime is the source of the issue I think checking the installed version and adding the requirement to the docs should be fine.

  Thank you for suggesting actions.

 Dependencies shows all DLLs linked from libdeepspeech.so are located under C:\WINDOWS\system32\.
 
 On the installed module, can you hack into deepspeech/index.js and add some console.log statement to know about process.env['PATH'] before and after we compute it ?
 
 I printed oldPath and process.env['PATH'] just before require(binding_path) where an error occurs.
 
 oldPath: C:\Python37\Scripts\;C:\Python37\;...
 process.env['PATH']: C:\Users\Kazuaki\Desktop\devel\ds\node_modules\deepspeech\lib\binding\v0.6.0\win32-x64;C:\Python37\Scripts\;C:\Python37\;...
 
 It looks PATH is properly set. (... is just for truncation.)

  Then I'm sorry, I don't know how to debug that further. Out of luck, can you try latest NodeJS v13? This is what I was using (13.3.1 I think ?). Have you ran  against  to check if it depends on anything else than  ?

 It's likely this is hitting not just node users, if it is libdeepspeech.so that is linked against those runtime. I'm not a big fan of doing those checks in the library (and actually, I dont think we can since the linker will not load us).
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/carlfm01&gt;@carlfm01&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  Should we instead package those two deps along with our runtime ? And if so, where should we source those library ? From the builders ?

 Just to be 100% sure, you do have C:\Users\Kazuaki\Desktop\devel\ds\node_modules\deepspeech\lib\binding\v0.6.0\win32-x64\libdeepspeech.so and it is readable by your user, right ?

  I upgraded NodeJS to the latest one (13.5.0), confirmed  exists on the certain path and it is readable, however, loading  still produces the same error. I understand it is hard to investigate the problem further unless reproducing the same error on your environment. I'll see if I can find solutions.

 The character ¥ appears in place of \ when setting Japanese locale on Windows. I understand it is just a matter of font.

 It is Japanese locale. I run node from Powershell and Command prompt.

 It would not be completely impossible this is triggering a bug. It'd be awesome if you could check that:

 try under Powershell with C locale (I don't know how to do that)
