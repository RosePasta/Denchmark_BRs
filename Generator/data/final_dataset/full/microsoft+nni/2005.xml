 TypeError: mul(): argument 'other' (position 1) must be Tensor, not dict
 
 Hey NNI developers,
 I would like to utilize NNI for pruning. However, when I just installed NNI and ran the demo example from here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/examples/model_compress/main_torch_pruner.py&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/nni/blob/master/examples/model_compress/main_torch_pruner.py&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 I came with this error.
 How to reproduce it:
 python main_torch_pruner.py
 nni Environment:
 
 nni version: 1.3
 nni mode(local|pai|remote): local
 OS: Ubuntu 16.04
 python version: 3.6
 is conda or virtualenv used?: Yes
 is running in docker?: Yes. Nvidia-docker
 PyTorch: 1.3
 CUDA: 10.1
 
 Any idea to solve it? If there is something wrong with the demo, there should be bugs in the code.

 		I tracked back to the source code and set a tracepoint at nni/compression/torch/pruners.py", line 116.
 Then, I found that  is a dict, which only has a key 'weight' and  is the mask_dict, of which the type a torch.Tensor and the size is the same as the weight parameter.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37952703/73938900-35971c00-4923-11ea-9589-be8973b4c4b9.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 After that, I modified the code at nni/compression/torch/pruners.py", line 116
 from
  w_abs = weight.abs() * mask
 to
  w_abs = weight.abs() * mask['weight'].
 And the program runs successfully.
 However, I am not sure if this solution would result in other side effects since I am not familiar with NNI.

 @RizhaoCai - could you please submit a PR for this fix? thanks.
 
 OK. I will check if there will be any side effects and then submit a PR.
