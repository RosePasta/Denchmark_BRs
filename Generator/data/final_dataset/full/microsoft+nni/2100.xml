 	<summary>Invalid typeof check in observableTimer</summary>
 	<description>
 Short summary about the issue/question:
 The unsubscribe method is doing an invalid typeof check:
 
 
 
 nni/src/nni_manager/common/observableTimer.ts
 
 
          Line 22
       in
       ff2728c
 
 
 
 
 
 
  if(typeof subscription !== undefined) { 
 
 
 
 
 
 typeof undefined !== undefined
 // true
 
 typeof undefined === 'undefined'
 // true
 Brief what process you are following:
 Nothing, I was just reading through the codebase :)
 Anything else we need to know:
 ESLint is already configured to use the "recommended" preset which has the valid-typeof, so maybe this was introduced before ESLint was setup.

    Thanks for your good catch, will you send a PR to fix it? The intention was to check whether subscription is undefined. It is a mistake.
