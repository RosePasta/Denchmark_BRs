 	<summary>Error in `psd_safe_cholesky` (when data has low noise?)</summary>
 	<description>
 It's possible to hit the &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/blob/9a2fb2ef870bf66efc29775245b8ce6c624e45a5/gpytorch/utils/cholesky.py#L43&gt;return L&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  line in  without  being defined. This happens if  throws a  for both  and  and  is not in the error message. Then the user just gets , which isn't very helpful. I'm not actually sure what error I got that led to this, but perhaps it would be good to change
 if "singular" in e.args[0]:
     raise RuntimeError("Adding jitter of {} to the diagonal did not make A p.d.".format(jitter))
 to
 if "singular" in e.args[0]:
     raise RuntimeError("Adding jitter of {} to the diagonal did not make A p.d.".format(jitter))
 else:  # or skip the else, depending on your coding style
     raise
 This should give the user a more useful error message at least. Or is there anything that would be better to do in this case?

 		I've seen this error before. I think that this typically fails when there are NaNs, which isn't caught by our exception handling.

  - your solution would be good so that we can get better error messages, and try to pin-point the problem more closely.
