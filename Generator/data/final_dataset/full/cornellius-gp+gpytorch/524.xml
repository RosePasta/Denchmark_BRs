 	<summary>Where is `fast_pred_var` moving?</summary>
 	<description>
 I received the following warning when using fast_pred_var:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;/cluster/nhunt/anaconda/envs/bayes_opt/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gpytorch/beta_features.py:17:
 DeprecationWarning: `gpytorch.settings.fast_pred_var` has moved to `gpytorch.settings.fast_pred_var`.
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 It seems that I'm being warned that fast_pred_var has moved to its current location. Was there a typo in the warning about how we should be using this setting now?
 $ pip list | grep gpytorch
 gpytorch           0.2.1

  This seems like a problem with the autogenerated warning.

   now lives in  -- the location you are seeing it at is the correct location.

 		Hmmm yeah I'll see if I can figure out what the issue is. The correct context manager is with gpytorch.settings.fast_pred_var
 (It used to be either gpytorch.beta_features.fast_pred_var an also as gpytorch.fast_pred_var, but these are both deprecated)

 		Ah, I see - I was actually using gpytorch.fast_pred_var, so it was correct that I received the deprecation warning. It was just confusing that in the warning it said gpytorch.settings.fast_pred_var both times (instead of gpytorch.fast_pred_var has moved to gpytorch.settings.fast_pred_var or gpytorch.beta_features.fast_pred_var has moved to gpytorch.settings.fast_pred_var, depending on how it was accessed). Thanks for clearing that up! I'll leave the issue open for fixing the warning message.
