 	<summary>Feature Request: Ability to specify enqueue timeout</summary>
 	<description>
 Since upgrading, I have multiple examples of CycleGAN fail due to enqueue timeout (I think mainly on the test set). There should be  a way to specify the timeout without editing the source code or at the very least the timeout should be increased significantly.

 		It's too bad if it takes &gt;10s for a datapoint. Anyway I'll increase it and provide an option.

 		I think I narrowed down the issue. Model saver + visualizing test set can easily take more than ten seconds. (Since they use different dataflows it thinks the training one has timed out since it hasn't received anything in 10+ seconds). Model saving alone can easily take 10 seconds if you are saving over the network. Maybe you need to add an exception to the timeout for callbacks?
