 	<summary>It may be worth limiting the size of a user's message.</summary>
 	<description>
 Sending an absurdly long message (gibberish or not) results in a correspondingly absurd wait time as Olivia tries to understand what you're saying :) Though she does eventually manage to figure it out!

 Since it's a chat application, it may be worth limiting the user input to a certain reasonable number of characters, like 500 max maybe (I'm not sure what a good number would be).
 This likely won't be an issue in the general use case, but I enjoy breaking things and figured I'd chime in, lol.

 		Very good point, Iâ€™ll limit the size to 500

 		No problem! Though I was thinking more along the lines of preventing the user from entering a large message in the first place by imposing a character limit on the text input widget (basically ignoring input if the size of the entered message is already 500 chars). It may even be good to show a little counter for how many characters are left, sort of like on Twitter. (Just throwing ideas/suggestions out there! :D)
 That way, the app doesn't lag/Olivia doesn't take a long time to respond. Since you're hosting it on Heroku, though, I guess it's (maybe?) not a big deal because it's not your personal server handling it :)
