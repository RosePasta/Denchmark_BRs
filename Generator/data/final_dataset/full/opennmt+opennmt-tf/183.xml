 	<summary>average_last_checkpoints crashes in distributed training</summary>
 	<description>
 1.5.0 (2018-06-08)
 New features
 Training option average_last_checkpoints to automatically average checkpoints at the end of the training
 Reading the new features I found on 1.5.0 an amazing new parameter to automatically do the avg of the checkpoints  but when I try to use I get this message.
 Traceback (most recent call last):

 I went to the console and did the ls inside the folder
 ubuntu@mltraining:~/NaturalLanguageRecognition/NaturalLanguageManager/src/Intent_Classification/model$ ls
 checkpoint  events.out.tfevents.1532590583.mltraining  graph.pbtxt        model.ckpt-369.meta    projector_config.pbtxt  src_word_vocab.txt
 eval        events.out.tfevents.1532591278.mltraining  model.ckpt-0.meta  model_description.pkl  src_char_vocab.txt
 Then I went to the checkpoint file and took a look:
 model_checkpoint_path: "model.ckpt-369"
 all_model_checkpoint_paths: "model.ckpt-0"
 all_model_checkpoint_paths: "model.ckpt-369"
 looks like its trying to find the name inside the checkpoint but its saved with the extension .meta
 The weird thing its the restore training works very well its just when doing the average of the checkpoints

 		Are you using distributed training? I'm not sure checkpoint averaging is correctly supported in this scenario. Thanks for reporting.

 		yes I'm using distributed training , looking to the code, its checking if its a chief machine before doing the avg. Also I tried to run the script manually and its happening the same thing
 Right now I have 3 machines. 1 chief(gpu) 1 worker(gpu) and 1 ps server (cpu)
 I'm not running the script from the same folder as the model. I'm just sending the full path from another path because I have a central python script running all the scripts from there

 		Thanks. Not sure how to handle correctly this case yet so I need to investigate. Feel free to share any insights.

 		I will try to train it without distributed training and see what happens. if I find the fix I will send it to you

 		on the first look. Looks like the files are splitted between chief and ps server ( not sure if I have more than one ps server)
 When doing non distributed training the model folder contains files .index and 0000-of-0002
 and the meta files with the checkpoint file
 but with distributed training
 the chief contains .meta files and checkpoint
 the ps server contains .index and 0000-of-0002
 I will keep investigating

 		non distributed training:
 checkpoints_path = tf.train.get_checkpoint_state(model_dir).all_model_checkpoint_paths
 is returning a list of strings with the path of the file
 but also there is only 1 checkpoint instead all of them. I had 4 saved checkpoints inside the folder
 Instead on distributed:
 is returning an object. RepeatedScalarContainer with the path of the meta files

 		Well Its not a fix but if you setup the chief and ps machine the same. then it will work since it will have all the files on the same machine and the other pc can be setup as workers.
 But I find it weird because its saying Averaging 1 checkpoints... and I had 5 checkpoints to be saved on the config file

 I think that is the expected behavior. I also read that one should consider using a shared filesystem to properly load a checkpoint produced by a distributed training.
 With all this information, I don't think there is anything to change in OpenNMT-tf.

 		Well it will only work if you have on the same machine all files :) but it will not work if you setup a different ps machine to free up gpu memory so you can have a bigger model or bigger batch size. I tried to setup the ps on a cpu machine but it was more slow.
 and I'm not sure if you have more than 1 ps server what will happen jejeje
 The other issue is the code its finding only the last checkpoint not sure why even if there are more than one checkpoint , so its getting the last one, and not doing and avg

 		HDFS could be used to share a filesystem across separate machines. Not sure if it requires code change or not.

 What value did you set to average_last_checkpoints?

 		I see, for the readme I was adding true instead a number :P my mistake! thanks

 		According to me, the only action required by this issue is to better support remote/shared filesystems like HDFS or S3. The PR above improves the support of such configurations for the model directory and data files.
 Closing for now.
