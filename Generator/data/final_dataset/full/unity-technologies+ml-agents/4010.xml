 	<summary>Documentation: unclear how to find "ML-Agents Toolkit"</summary>
 	<description>
 Describe the bug
 There was a small gap in the installation instructions, where going from the installation guide to the getting started page, it assumes you've downloaded ml-agents (I can say this might seem obvious yes, but it was not obvious to me) .
 
 I'm on window. I followed &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_2/docs/Installation.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_2/docs/Installation.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  exactly, omitting the optional step "Clone the ML-Agents Toolkit Repository (Optional)"
 The next recommended page is &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_2/docs/Getting-Started.md&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_2/docs/Getting-Started.md&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 However, all I've done up to this point (following the installation guide to the best of my abilities) are
 *installed unity
 *installed python
 *installed a unity package
 *installed a python package
 I don't have any local files.
 Oh, am I meant to download the ml-agents package from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents&gt;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  if I don't clone the repo?  If this is the case, it'd be helpful if the installation guide said it explicitly something like "either you download a release of this repo, or you clone the entire repo".    It was not obvious to me, and would've saved me some confusion.

 		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/increpare&gt;@increpare&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  as of version Release 1, you technically do not need to install from the Github repo (you install the C# package from the Unity Package manager and the Python using PIP).
 However, you are correct in that it is not clear.  I will update the documentation and copy / paste the PR here.
