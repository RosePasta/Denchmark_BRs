 	<summary>Failing to create and API on Windows</summary>
 	<description>
 Describe the bug
 Failing to create an api on windows ,
 bentoml serve {saved_path}
 To Reproduce
 Steps to reproduce the behavior:
 
 Failing with an error of the  fnctl  was not found
 fixed it by using this and creating a fcntl.py
 
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;def fcntl(fd, op, arg=0):
     return 0
 
 def ioctl(fd, op, arg=0, mutable_flag=True):
     if mutable_flag:
         return 0
     else:
         return ""
 
 def flock(fd, op):
     return
 
 def lockf(fd, operation, length=0, start=0, whence=0):
     return
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 
 Then the  import pwd started failing , for which I dont have any work around till now .
 
 Environment:
 
 OS: [windows 10 ]
 Python/BentoML Version [Python3.6]

 		Thanks for reporting this issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/chetanzope&gt;@chetanzope&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  ! We are working on a fix now, it was because we imported gunicorn which was only supposed to be used when running API server in linux/docker environment.
 Will update with PR soon, and it should go into next release, expecting early next week.

 		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/harashm&gt;@harashm&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , yes we noticed that too - it was reported here: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues/663&gt;#663&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 And we have fixed the issue as well as adding CI test to prevent this from happening in the future: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/pull/665&gt;#665&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 The fix will be released the coming Monday in version 0.7.7
 Thanks!
