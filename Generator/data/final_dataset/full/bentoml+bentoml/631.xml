 	<summary>botocore.exceptions.ClientError</summary>
 	<description>
 Hey BentoML Maintainers,
 I am currently facing an issue deploying my model to AWS Lambda, although i followed the docs completely. I have received the botocore.exceptions.ClientError indicating there's (NoSuchBucket) when calling the GetBuckAcl Operations and InvalidLocationConstraint when calling the CreateBucket Operations. Any tips in regards to this? Is there like a parameter that i can use to create this bucket?

 Thanks!

 		hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/jjneojiajun&gt;@jjneojiajun&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  what is the region you are trying to deploy to?
 There is an ongoing issue on boto3 that create an S3 bucket will fail for region  that I am not aware,  &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/125&gt;boto/boto3#125&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 .  I tested deploy lambda with the  region and received the same error as you did.
 I am working on a fix for creating S3 bucket for the us-east-1 region.
 If you are not deploying to that region, could you provide more info on which region you are deploying to?

 Hi &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/yubozhao&gt;@yubozhao&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , yes I was trying to deploy to us-east-1 region. So I guess this is part of the bug fix that's required. I will close this thread then. Thank you! :)

 		I'm still getting this issue after the first deployment to lambda.
 Running version 0.8.1 or bentoml.
 The first deployment worked for the most part, however subsequent deployments do not.

 		Hi, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/spencersmith&gt;@spencersmith&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , I tested deploying and updating with the quick start example BentoService with  region. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to reproduce the boto3 ClientError about InvalidLocationConstraint error for creating Bucket.
 Can you share your boto3 version and what region you are deploying into?

 		hey &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/spencersmith&gt;@spencersmith&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , are you still experiencing this issue?
 I think this exact issue(InvalidLocationConstraint with us-east-1 region) should have been fixed in 0.8.1, you might be experiencing a different issue (or our fix did not work). Could you provide the exact error logs if you still have it or if you can still reproduce this issue?
