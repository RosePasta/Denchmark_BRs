 	<summary>Broken link in Documentation</summary>

 The Module Index link at the bottom of the main page of the Lightning documentation is broken. This seems to be because the make html command does not create a py-modindex.html file (not sure why).
 If the Module Index page is not required a solution is to remove * :ref: modindex from the index.rst file.
 Additionally, below the Module Index link there is a link to a search page, that is currently empty. Seeing as searching is possible in the sidebar, not sure if the page is required, so could remove * :ref: search as well.
 Not super familiar with Sphinx but think this wouldn't break anything.

 		It's a very minor issue, but seeing as the link is broken and on the main page thought it was worthwhile raising.
 Below is the screenshot (can be found by scrolling to the bottom of &lt;denchmark-link:https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&gt;https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ),

 The Module Index link is broken and the Search Page link leads to an empty page. I believe Sphinx automatically adds links to Index, Module Index, and Search Page to index.rst when first creating the docs (see &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blame/master/docs/source/index.rst#L132-L134&gt;here&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 ). I can send a PR to remove them if you think the links are not necessary.
