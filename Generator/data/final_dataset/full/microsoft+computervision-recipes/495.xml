 	<summary>[BUG] We should guarantee that conda environments are built from a clean slate</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Our current test infrastructure on Azure DevOps is built around the premise that a new, clean conda environment is built from scratch every time.
 As such, we have steps in the test/build pipelines that attempt to clean up newly built environments so that any remaining artifacts from the previous build are cleaned up before the next test/build is run.
 That said, we currently are not doing enough to guarantee that NO artifacts are left over across tests/builds.
 We should add more steps in the build/test pipelines to ensure that the conda environments used for tests are built from a clean slate to prevent prior builds' artifacts from impacting future builds.
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;In which platform does it happen?&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Any non-Microsoft-hosted build agents as we are guaranteed fresh virtual machines each time when using Microsoft-hosted build agents.
