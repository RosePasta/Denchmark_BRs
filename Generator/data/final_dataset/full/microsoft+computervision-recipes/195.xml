 	<summary>Minor improvements to 01_training_introduction notebook</summary>
 	<description>
 
 from fastai.vision import *
 
 importing * is not considered best practice. Consider importing functions/classes you need explicitly.
 
 "we demonstrate training and evaluating a CNN image classification model. "
 
 Consider re-wording to: we demonstrate how to train and evaluate a CNN image classification model”.
 
 We suggest using an Azure DSVM Standard NC6 for an as needed GPU compute resource
 
 Wording is off. Consider changing to “… NC6 as a GPU compute resource”
 
 The helper function downloads and unzips data set to the image_classification/data directory
 
 Change the file path to classification/data.
 
 These are linked metrics that quantify how well the model classifies an image against how it fails.
 
 Wording is off. Consider changing to: “…how well the model classifies an image against a known label, and where it fails”.
 
 Use blackcellmagic extension to format the notebook code cells.
