 	<summary>00 Webcam nb: Loaded into a range of [0,1]</summary>

 It would be great to explain what that means, especially for users new to CV.

 		I second this issue - the following sentence needs more explanation:
 "This model expects RGB-images as input. These are loaded into a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]."
 The link to fastai.vision.imagenet_stats leads to a code snippet on github. There is really no explanation here on why these specific numbers are used for normalization. It might be good to add explanation here on why these numbers are selected. Otherwise, you can omit mentioning the normalization numbers, as they are not necessary for understanding this notebok.
