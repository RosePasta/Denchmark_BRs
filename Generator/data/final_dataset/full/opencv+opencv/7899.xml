 	<summary>wrong doc for fast means</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-link:http://docs.opencv.org/2.4.10/modules/photo/doc/denoising.html?highlight=denoise#fastnlmeansdenoisingcolored&gt;http://docs.opencv.org/2.4.10/modules/photo/doc/denoising.html?highlight=denoise#fastnlmeansdenoisingcolored&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 The parameter is listed as hColor in the signature, but later referenced as hForColorComponents.  Also enought is mispeeled and should be enough.
 I didn't check other versions of the doc to see if there was the same problem.

 		The issue seems to have been resolved in the .hpp file but the website still has same issue. Can anyone tell me what can be done to resolve it?

 		2.4.10 documentation is freezed and will not be changed anymore. You should look on active "2.4" maintenance branch instead. Anyway there is no fix on "2.4" yet - "master" branch has this fix only.
 To fix it on branch "2.4" you should prepare patch (PR - pull request) via GitHub for "2.4" branch (BTW, "2.4" documentation is stored separately and there are no documentation parts in .hpp files).

 		I cloned the opencv repo and found documentation under "/modules/photo/doc/denoising.rst"
 I also modified the rst file to fix the mentioned bug.
 Side Note - The bug only mentions inconsistency in the "fastNlMeansDenoisingColored" documentation, but the same bug also exists in "fastNlMeansDenoisingColoredMulti" documentation.
 Im confused as to how I should build the documentation before submitting a PR. Do I use "sphinx-build"?

 Please ignore the first PR
 Made a mistake and submitted PR to master instead of 2.4
 Sorry
