 	<summary>opencv2 header not including everything in standard library</summary>
 	<description>
 Is there a reason why adding #include "opencv2\opencv.hpp" excludes several modules? For example using the stitcher only works if you combine it with the specific header like follows
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;#include "opencv2/opencv.hpp"
 #include "opencv2/stitching.hpp"
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Since the stitching module is in the core library and not in the contributed modules, my opinion is that it should get included using the opencv.hpp header...

  does this tag means that the dev team actually agrees on this? If so I can simply provide a pull request, but I was wondering what the team would think!

  , this tag means that a comment from core team or other appropriate person is needed.
 As I can see, the  include  which should be generated by cmake from &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/cmake/templates/opencv_modules.hpp.in&gt;the template&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . Does it contain needed module?

 		I guess there lies the problem. After building OpenCV, the content of my auto generated opencv_modules.hpp found at /usr/local/include/opencv2/ after doing a sudo make install is
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;/*
  *      ** File generated automatically, do not modify **
  *
  * This file defines the list of modules available in current build configuration
  *
  *
 */
 
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_CALIB3D
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_CORE
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_FEATURES2D
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_FLANN
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_HIGHGUI
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_IMGCODECS
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_IMGPROC
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_ML
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_OBJDETECT
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_PHOTO
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_SHAPE
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_STITCHING
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_SUPERRES
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_VIDEO
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_VIDEOIO
 #define HAVE_OPENCV_VIDEOSTAB
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 So basically the defines are there, but not the includes that need to be in between them :D looks like a bug to me!

 		Yes, I agree. Feel free to provide pull request with a fix.
 BTW, if you add -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install parameter when running cmake, then make install will put all files to build/install folder without modifying system libraries and headers. It can be useful for experimenting.

 		Ah good to know! Will take a closer look why the generation is not working correctly!
