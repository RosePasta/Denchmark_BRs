 &lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;Multiple bugs in cv::LevMarqSparse, which let it crash and not work properly.&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;ile name: ba.cpp
 
 I have found more than one bug in this implementation. I would list them out:
 
 1) The implementation assumes pointer size to be 32 bit, while on my 64 bit UBUNTU/OPENSUSE system, gcc shows size of pointer to be 64 bit and because of this it crashes during run time.
 
 The matrices A, B, W and Vis_index which store pointers, have type CV_32S. (line 214 - 217). If I chage the type to CV_32SC2, this bug gets fixed.
 
 2) In the method fjac in Jacobian computation, at line 728
 
 CvMat* _mp = cvCreateMat(1, 2, CV_64F ); //projection of the point
 
 The type CV_64F cause assertion failure during run time in cvProjectPoints2 . This bug gets fixed, if I change the type to CV_64FC2 and reduce number of cols to 1, i.e. 
 
 CvMat* _mp = cvCreateMat(1, 1, CV_64FC2 ); //projection of the point
 
 The same bug lies in function named 'func', which is used to compute projections. At line 937
 
  CvMat* _mp = cvCreateMat(1, 2, CV_64F ); //projection of the point
 
 again if I change type to CV_64FC2, it gets fixed. Also in this case it would need to be reshaped before 
   line 963:
 
 cvTranspose( _mp, estim );
 
 i.e.
 
 cvReshape(_mp,_mp,1,0);
 cvTranspose( _mp, estim );
 
 
 3) At line 1106:
 params.rowRange(i*num_cam_param + 10,i*num_cam_param+10+numdist).copyTo(distCoeffs[i]);
 
    The distortion being copied is the one which has been given as input for optimization, but rather it should be optimized one. i.e.
 
 (levmar.P).rowRange(i*num_cam_param + 10,i*num_cam_param+10+numdist).copyTo(distCoeffs[i]);
 
 This causes wrong output of optimization.
 
 4) I noticed that the optimization does not let focal length and principal point vary at all, it only changes distortion and motion parameters. Though, I do not have any specific line to point out, but I still believe it is not natural behaviour of bundle adjustment. I compared it's output with sba package provided at http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/sba/  and sba's output confirms my suspecion.
 
 I wanted to use this implementation in a software. I would be grateful if anyone fixes it soon.

 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;Any special reason why this is open? Not reproducible, no longer relevant (legacy), not enough resources (developer time) to fix?
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
