 	<summary>cuda::HOG instability bug in release mode</summary>
 	<description>
 Hello,
 I have found that the opencv cuda HOG implementation is non deterministic:
 if you write a code where you perform HOG features extraction a thousand of times in a loop, you will see that the returned descriptors are not always the same (about 3 to 5 times over 1000 they are different).
 This doesn't happen in debug mode (with -g -G compilation flags).
 I have found that the instability originates from the cuda-kernel: normalize_hists_kernel_many_blocks.
 SOLUTION:
 there is a race condition in calling reduce_smem kernel.
 In order to fix this a __syncthreads() has to be added before the second call of reduce_smem.
 But I have no answer to the question: why not before the first call too???
 Hope this can help

  , you've merged the fix to your fork, not to OpenCV mainline.
