 	<summary>V2 Preview-1 In app error messages for creating a new project without connections AB#17057</summary>
 	<description>
 Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
 My first time downloading VoTT I went to create a new project but was unsuccessful because I hadn't created connections before attempting to create the new project. I did see that in the documentation it said that connections were required to create a new project, but I didn't see that until after the fact. Currently when I just create a new project without any connections I click "Save Project" and nothing happens.
 Describe the solution you'd like
 It would be nice if an error message came up saying that connections are required to create a project (similar to how one comes up if you try to create a project without a name)
 Describe alternatives you've considered
 Additional context
 Even though it does say it's required in the documentation, I read through all the documentation before playing around with it and still got stumped (it's tough to remember all of the details). It's also safe to say a decent portion of folks will not read the documentation at all.

 		Thanks for your feedback &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/alancast&gt;@alancast&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . This is a bug.  An error message should display when you attempt to create a new project without selecting a source &amp; target connection.
