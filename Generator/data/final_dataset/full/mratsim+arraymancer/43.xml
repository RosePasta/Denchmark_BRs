 	<summary>Span slicing inside dynamic type procs fails to compile</summary>
 	<description>
 Minor test case:
 import arraymancer
 
 proc boo[T](): T =
   var a = zeros([2,2], int)
   echo a[1,_]
 
 discard boo[int]()
 When compiling the following error is shown:
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;test.nim(4, 12) Error: undeclared identifier: '_'
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 Removing dynamic type [T] from the proc the code works fine.

 		I've reproduced it and reported it to Nim upstream.
 It seems like for generic procs, there is an identifier resolution happening before the macros kick-in and replace "_".
 I may have a workaround by exporting a dummy "_" but I don't want to pollute namespace with that symbol. And it's used in tuple pattern-matching as well and maybe by other libs.

 		You can workaround that issue by using mixin _ from module macros in the procs that uses "_"

 		This workaround does not work with more complex silicing, like x[_, _, ^1..0|-1]

 		Not sure which identifier poses the issue here, with seq I can "solve" it by adding everything as mixin :/
 proc foo4[T](): CustomSeq[T] =
   result.data.newSeq(10)
   # weird fancy corner case that feels special and wants special treatment
   mixin _,`|-`
   # why?
   echo result[_, _, ^1..0|-1]
 Case is closed upstream, but I really think generics have an issue as detailed by Krux
