 	<summary>Docker image out of date</summary>
 	<description>
 Thanks for your great work on this library! I'm using GPflow for a programming assignment in a class that I'm teaching. I was hoping to point students towards your docker image. Unfortunately, it appears the docker image is still running 0.3.5. Is it indeed out of date, or might I have done something silly?

 		Hi Jan-Willem. Yes it is certainly out of date. My apologies- I will add a ticket to regenerate it.

 		Hello, looking to run the latest version of GPflow with docker. Is this PR ready to be finalised.

 		It looks like the Docker image linked to from the documentation (&lt;denchmark-link:https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/develop/intro.html&gt;https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/develop/intro.html&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , even for 2.0 version) is massively out of date (still 0.3.5). Should we remove the link, or update the docker image? (Who even has permission to update the docker image, and who knows what would be needed for that?)
