 	<summary>Notebook on polyaxon should enables us download files.</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Feature motivation&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 One of the challenge to use notebook is to synchronize notebooks between on polyaxon and in local. As well as, I want to download trained models from notebook on polyaxon. However, when I tried to download file from remote notebooks, I was faced with 403 forbidden.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1523515/61250282-2abd3580-a70c-11e9-8578-49e2a7e79b41.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Feature description&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 It would be great to download files from notebooks.
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Feature implementation&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 I seems that we can improve it by adding a option to jupyter notebook.

 		Notebook experience is one of the things that need to be improved for sure, there are many things steps that I am already thinking about.
 Was this a file that you tried to download or a model? is it possible to attach a very simple script and some steps to reproduce the issue.
 Thanks for reporting.

 		I usually use a script to upload files to GCS using polyastore. But it is a little bothersome to me.
 Technically, we may be able to resolve the issue like below.
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;# Or, jupyter notebook option
 jupyter notebook ... --NotebookApp.allow_origin='*'
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;

 		It should be part of the v0.5.4 release, thanks for the flag suggestion.

 		Reopening this, it's seems to only solve the issue when using JupyterLab and not notebooks.

 		Closed as well in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon/pull/690&gt;#690&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  , Polyaxon has a much better implementation for proxing request wihtout limiting use cases.
