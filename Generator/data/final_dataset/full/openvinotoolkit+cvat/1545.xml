 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Expected Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Installed latest version in new directory. Expected working system.
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Current Behaviour&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Ended up with
 Server 1.0
 Core 0.5.2
 Canvas 0.5.2
 UI 0.5.2
 with error messages appearing on login:
 Could not get formats from the server
 TypeError: (intermediate value).map is not a function
 and when trying to create a task:
 Could not create the task
 Error: Request failed with status code 400. {"image_quality":["This field is required."]}.
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Possible Solution&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Problems may be related to previous installation of version 0.5.2 in different directory?

 Install CVAT according to instructions.
 Login
 Try to create task
 
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;Context&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Trying to switch from version 0.5.2 to 1.0.0.

  Hi, could you please try to clear browser cache?
 Probably related issue &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/issues/1496&gt;#1496&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 		Thanks! Clearing the cache resolved these errors. Can you confirm that having server version 1.0.0 and version 0.5.2 after installation is the intended behavior?

 		I have the same problem, but clearing the cache does not work. I find the posted payload has no image_quality field.

  Could you try to create a task with another browser or incognito mode?

 I also try it in Chrome. I think I find the bug.   misses  field, which is required  in  and not missed in . I will give a try.

   Sorry, I have delete the server. I think it may be my faults. I build the server fail now, because pyav requires FFmpeg&gt;=3.2. Maybe, it is because I did not notice the upgrade fail.
 Now I want to know, for the , the  field is required or not at the server side?

  when you create the task the client makes 2 requests:
 post at the  endpoint and there is no  field required
 post at : the  field is required for this request

  That's it! It is because my server upgrade fails, and  endpoint of previous version requires  .
 The upgrade fail comes from that python av module requires ffmpeg&gt;=3.2, but the version installed from source is 2.8.15 using Docker image ubuntu16.04. May I have to install latest ffmpeg manually?

 		We use this repo to install ffmpeg3 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/Dockerfile#L26-L27&gt;https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/develop/Dockerfile#L26-L27&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 Did  you modify the Dockerfile to delete these lines?

  Yes, I am in China. The repo is very slow due to some reasons, so I delete the repo and install some related packages manually. However, installing ffmpeg manually is very boring.

 		Got it, in you case I think will be better try to change base image to 18.04 or 20.04 that have ffmpeg3  in main repository. So, I think that minimal dockerfile modifications will be required. We plan to change the base image but if you help with this it would be nice.

 		I tried a little last night with 18.04, but I did not find gstreamer-ffmpeg for ubuntu above 16.04. In addition, some dependencies of gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg can not be found in 18.04 main repository. I wonder the  package will not work properly in ubuntu &gt; 16.04. Now I have solved my problem by downloading related packages and making a local repository.

  Can we add a hash to the bundle or use something else to resolve such issues in the future?

 Probably webpack has something like this.
 Need to investigate
