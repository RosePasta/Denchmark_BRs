 &lt;denchmark-h:h2&gt;üêõ Bug&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 I'm trying to list available models and getting an error while doing that. This error wasn't there till yesterday but for some reason is showing today after updating the module.
 &lt;denchmark-h:h3&gt;To Reproduce&lt;/denchmark-h&gt;
 
 Steps to reproduce the behavior:
 
 I'm following the guide mentioned here - https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/translation/README.md
 Same error occurs on the google collab provided here - https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_fairseq_translation/
 See error
