 With the current master, &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/commit/4ace9e923b873e90b1a097dff3a480f17c0d1d80&gt;4ace9e9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 We definitely need nightly/daily unit test for armv7l &amp; aarch64

 		Uh.. this is typecasting float-to-uint problem.
 Didn't we resolve this already???
 PTAL &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/wooksong&gt;@wooksong&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
   (If my memory serves right, it was you who brought this up and solved it)

  Right. The typecasting float-to-uint issue was resolved and unit TCs &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/issues/8&gt;#8&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 /&lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/issues/9&gt;#9&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  were not failed until tensor_transform is refactored. Anyway, I will look into it.
 While I am writing the comment, you've already submitted the PR to resolve this issue. Thanks.
