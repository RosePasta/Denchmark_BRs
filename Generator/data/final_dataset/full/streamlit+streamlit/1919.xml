 		Works for me

 		Huh, weird. First image was Chrome on windows, and it's also broken on Firefox on windows:
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b188a871cc6de32ac987fff8dc0093949d3a132614d1432205d8dffe1fd7096e/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f51675066316d442e706e67&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 As well as Chrome on Android:
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/856034/91211498-b8b37000-e6c3-11ea-911d-0985bb3e3ef4.png&gt;&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 The image source when I inspect source seems to be &lt;denchmark-link:https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5ae1dcfd188be26bbb0648fb62e9d6d593dbb6f5/68747470733a2f2f617773312e646973636f757273652d63646e2e636f6d2f7374616e6461726431302f75706c6f6164732f73747265616d6c69742f6f726967696e616c2f31582f323932653938356637663735656637626566386332376235383939663731663736636435373765302e676966&gt;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5ae1dcfd188be26bbb0648fb62e9d6d593dbb6f5/68747470733a2f2f617773312e646973636f757273652d63646e2e636f6d2f7374616e6461726431302f75706c6f6164732f73747265616d6c69742f6f726967696e616c2f31582f323932653938356637663735656637626566386332376235383939663731663736636435373765302e676966&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 which 403 (Forbidden)s for me
 Actually, the original link in the readme, &lt;denchmark-link:https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/streamlit/original/1X/292e985f7f75ef7bef8c27b5899f71f76cd577e0.gif&gt;https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/streamlit/original/1X/292e985f7f75ef7bef8c27b5899f71f76cd577e0.gif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 Also 403s for me. Speculating: &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/randyzwitch&gt;@randyzwitch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  , do you have permission to view that aws bucket, which isn't granted to members of the public in gneeral?

 		This came up &lt;denchmark-link:https://streamlit.slack.com/archives/C9E9D51TM/p1597078201000600&gt;before&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 . The image is hosted on Github. The options seems to be to add to our repo or find another host.

 		Closing this for now, as it's not a critical issue that needs to be solved (i.e. if it's a GitHub CDN issue, then I would hope they will handle it)

 		Reopening as I'm still experiencing this issue two weeks later. I still suspect it's related to Discourse CDN rather than Github, since the discourse link still denies me permission to view: &lt;denchmark-link:https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/streamlit/original/1X/292e985f7f75ef7bef8c27b5899f71f76cd577e0.gif&gt;https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/streamlit/original/1X/292e985f7f75ef7bef8c27b5899f71f76cd577e0.gif&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 
 It is weird that it works for Randy on incognito, as it doesn't work on any of these for me:
 
 Chrome on Windows (normal or incognito)
 Firefox on Ubuntu VM (normal or incognito)
 Firefox on Windows (normal or incognito)
 Chrome on Android (normal or incognito)
 
 That'e enough different environments that I suspect the working gif is only visible to a select few users.
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/randyzwitch&gt;@randyzwitch&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  or &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/karriebear&gt;@karriebear&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
   , could you just download the .gif that you see, and paste it in this issue as an attachment? Then I can go ahead and figure out where to host it and update the readme accordingly.
 (In the long run, we might want to think harder about where we host these kind of image/video assets; probably an s3/gcp bucket we control, as opposed to various CDNs of various social media sites?)

 		As you say this, its currently not working for me. I think someone had it not work for them but then working for them later on.
