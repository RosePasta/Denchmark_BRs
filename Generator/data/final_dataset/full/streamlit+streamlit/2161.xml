 	<summary>Safari re-requests images inside a column</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-code&gt;import streamlit as st
 import time
 from PIL import Image
 
 image = Image.open("books.jpg")
 # Using this image by URL prevents Safari from reloading
 # image = "https://static.streamlit.io/examples/owl.jpg"
 # st.image(image, use_column_width=True)
 col1, _ = st.beta_columns(2)
 col1.image(image, use_column_width=True)
 
 for i in range(10):
     st.write("hi")
     time.sleep(2)
 &lt;/denchmark-code&gt;
 
 When a 1) local image file is 2) placed inside a column 3) on the latest develop (after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/2158&gt;#2158&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , anyways), each subsequent Streamlit call causes Safari to re-request the image, as shown on Safari's "networks" tab.
 Current hypothesis is that this is a caching issue; the reason is that an image loaded via URL does not exhibit the same re-requesting issue

 		Note that the re-request itself doesn't have any user-visible effects, as far as I can tell. But the code snippet does seem to trigger the same issue described in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/2145#issuecomment-707208698&gt;#2145 (comment)&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

  It does give a large amount of flickering, which is kinda weird. The end result is fine, but it's weird loading to get to that.
