 	<summary>CI reports linkcheck as passing for pull-requests even though it fails</summary>
 	<description>
 &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/szha&gt;@szha&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
  There is some bug in the CI setup for pull-requests. Even though the
 linkcheck consistently failed for all pull-requests after &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/566&gt;#566&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 , the CI did not
 recognize the failure and reported the test as passing. Only on the master
 branch, the CI correctly reports the test as failing.
 See for example the log for &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/732&gt;#732&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;
 :
 
 The pipeline checking the links is reported as passing
 http://ci.mxnet.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/detail/PR-732/32/pipeline/85
 However, looking at the detailed log files,
 http://ci.mxnet.io/blue/rest/organizations/jenkins/pipelines/GluonNLP-py3-master-gpu-doc/branches/PR-732/runs/32/nodes/85/steps/106/log/?start=0
 we see that the recipe for target linkcheck failed and reported Error 1 (last few lines)

 		This may be fixed by removing

 This is tentatively done in &lt;denchmark-link:https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/752&gt;#752&lt;/denchmark-link&gt;

 		Some external websites were down so this was added as a temporary measure. it shouldn't be needed anymore.
