I haven't seen this issue with any dataset I've tried so far.\n As to your questions:\n \n I opened #142 to track adding an API to select plot type. Currently only the automatic selection is possible.\n I opened #143 to track allowing more than one series per axis in plots where this makes sense.\n \n For your scenario of Absent/Present in one plot, you may be able to use a single two-column plot to represent what you want, by rearranging the data. I'm not sure what the current arrangement looks like, but assuming you have two columns like:\n <denchmark-code>Columns:\n \tDate\tstr\n \tAttendance\tstr\n \n Rows: 3\n \n Data:\n +----------+------------+\n |   Date   | Attendance |\n +----------+------------+\n | 12/01/17 |   Absent   |\n | 12/02/17 |  Present   |\n | 12/03/17 |  Present   |\n +----------+------------+\n [3 rows x 2 columns]\n </denchmark-code>\n \n You can plot this with tc.show(sf['Date'], sf['Attendance']). If this isn't what you had in mind, please clarify what kind of plot you're looking for and there may be a workaround to get it without adding support for multiple series per axis.
