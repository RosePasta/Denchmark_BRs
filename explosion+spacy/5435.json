(So at least it's not a bug related to model itself!)\n If a parse is available, Span.sent tries to analyze the parse to find sentence boundaries instead of using Token.sent_start, which it what Doc.sents uses. I think there's a bug in how it's finding the root or the parse boundaries, since the parser is what has set sent_start in the first place (from the exact same parses).\n Since doc.sents just uses sent_start, I think Span.sent could be modified to also just use sent_start, but it would be nice to understand what the bug is in the parse analysis. I suspect it's related to some of the l_edge/r_edge problems with non-projective dependency trees when you start modifying the parse on-the-fly, too.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "e63880e0812b4bf45a8f4a96bc26c3f4a10d9fb7", "commit_author": "adrianeboyd", "commitT": "2020-05-14 18:22:51+02:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "spacy\\tokens\\span.pyx", "file_new_name": "spacy\\tokens\\span.pyx", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "392,394", "deleted_lines": "392,393,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,403,404"}}}}}}
