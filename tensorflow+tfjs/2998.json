In this example, bias is a tensor create from a Float32Array which is part of a arrayBuffer and the value of bias will change after the add op. And I find that it will use the value of the arrayBuffer without the specified parameter 'byteOffset'. You can test by assign value to the first few bytes of the arrayBuffer.\n It seems caused by the use of function tf.setBackend('wasm'), bacause the tensor's value will be incorrect from the beginning if you setBackend before create the tensor. And this issue won't appear if use backend 'webgl'.\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "akineeic", "commentT": "2020-05-10T19:17:17Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI'm also experiencing this bug, it makes it difficult to conditionally switch backends as this code works with the webgl backend and not the wasm backend.\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "akineeic", "commentT": "2020-05-12T03:58:42Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t\n I'm also experiencing this bug, it makes it difficult to conditionally switch backends as this code works with the webgl backend and not the wasm backend.\n \n So that seems to be a commont bug when switch the backend from webgl to wasm.
