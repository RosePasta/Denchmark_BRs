Other methods, including the vanilla (slow) global registration and ICP always set these fields accordingly.\n Environment (please complete the following information):\n \n OS: Ubuntu 14.04\n Python version: 3.6.8, 2.7\n Open3D version: 0.6.0\n Is this remote workstation?: no\n How did you install Open3D?: conda\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "AndreiBarsan", "commentT": "2019-06-14T07:16:53Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/syncle>@syncle</denchmark-link>\n  take a look?\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "AndreiBarsan", "commentT": "2019-08-19T12:04:00Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI can confirm this behavior:\n OS: Ubuntu 18.04\n Python: 3.6.8\n Open3D 0.7.0\n Not remote workstation\n Installed via pip\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "AndreiBarsan", "commentT": "2019-10-06T14:41:06Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tOh, thanks for pointing out the issue.
