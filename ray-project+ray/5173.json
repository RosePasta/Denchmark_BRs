Besides, we allow the noise_scale to decay.\n To be equivalent, the threshold used to adjust parameter space noise should not ignore the intended noise_scale. We know that multiplying the action space noise with noise_scale is equivalent to multiply the \\sigma of OU by the noise_scale. Thus, we could simply adjust the parameter space noise according to noise_scale * \\sigma.\n <denchmark-h:h3>Source code / logs</denchmark-h>\n \n the threshold used to adjust the parameter space noise: <denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/agents/ddpg/ddpg_policy.py#L61>https://github.com/ray-project/ray/blob/master/python/ray/rllib/agents/ddpg/ddpg_policy.py#L61</denchmark-link>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "joneswong", "commentT": "2019-07-12T05:29:28Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/ericl>@ericl</denchmark-link>\n   Hi Eric, what's your opinion?
