The problem is that when LRU eviction is enabled for all objects, it is not safe to evict as soon as the system hits capacity. Instead, we trigger garbage collection on all Python workers and give the system some time to evict objects that have already gone out of scope. So it may still possible to see GC-related delays when using .\n If you tell us more about our use case, perhaps we can recommend something better.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "aa06c3b15ac4824081f9871b57dc9486f12e91e5", "commit_author": "Stephanie Wang", "commitT": "2020-06-02 11:48:03-07:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "python\\ray\\tests\\test_failure.py", "file_new_name": "python\\ray\\tests\\test_failure.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "920,921,922,923,924,925,926,927,933,934,935,936,937,938,939,940", "deleted_lines": "920", "method_info": {"method_name": "test_fill_object_store_lru_fallback", "method_params": "shutdown_only", "method_startline": "919", "method_endline": "966"}}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "src\\ray\\raylet\\node_manager.cc", "file_new_name": "src\\ray\\raylet\\node_manager.cc", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "3394,3395,3396,3397,3398,3399,3400,3401,3402,3403,3404,3405,3406,3407,3408,3409,3410,3411,3412,3413,3414,3416,3417,3418,3419,3420,3421,3423,3424,3425,3426,3427,3429,3430,3431,3432,3433,3434,3435,3436,3437,3438,3439,3441,3442", "deleted_lines": "3382,3383,3384,3385,3398,3399,3400,3401,3402,3403,3404,3405,3406,3407,3408,3409,3410,3411,3412,3413,3414,3415,3416,3417,3419,3420,3421,3422,3423,3424,3425,3427,3428,3429,3430,3431,3433,3434,3435,3436,3437,3438,3439,3440,3441", "method_info": {"method_name": "ray::raylet::NodeManager::HandlePinObjectIDs", "method_params": "request,reply,send_reply_callback", "method_startline": "3379", "method_endline": "3476"}}}}}}}
