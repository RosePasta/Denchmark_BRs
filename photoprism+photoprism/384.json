This is handy, but would also be good if it were possible to launch the lightbox into a view of all the photos that are 'selected' by the region indicated by the marker, just not sure how to preserve the double-click to zoom functionality - maybe have a pop-out on hover that takes you to the lightbox if clicked?\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "jimmcslim", "commentT": "2020-07-07T13:41:29Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks!

I thought that docker-compose pull would be sufficient to upgrade my stack, but I had to down and up... not just up on a stopped stack. Anyway, I have tested this and I see that it is working... clicking on a marker that encapsulates multiple photos zooms in, and when you are at the level of single photos, clicking on the marker takes you to that photo. Excellent!\n As a post-MVP feature, I think it would be great if there was still some pop-out affordance when a map marker summarises multiple photos if you could go to a lightbox view that would load only those photos in that area.\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "jimmcslim", "commentT": "2020-07-08T03:35:40Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tYou can use the search field to limit results (also in the lightbox) to a country, city, or other keyword.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "0b7d8a68974561e08f837172b47c15feb3c446c2", "commit_author": "Michael Mayer", "commitT": "2020-07-07 15:58:02+02:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "frontend\\src\\model\\photo.js", "file_new_name": "frontend\\src\\model\\photo.js", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "187,188,189,190,193,194", "deleted_lines": "189,191", "method_info": {"method_name": "localDate", "method_params": "time", "method_startline": "186", "method_endline": "194"}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "196,197", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "utcDate", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "196", "method_endline": "198"}}}}}}}
