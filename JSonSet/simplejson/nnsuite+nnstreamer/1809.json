This makes it impossible to verify the shape of the input set by the user without doing the actual. However, this creates a possibility of a run failing, and causing a crash without any handling. I suggest that the first run can be wrapped in a try/catch, so as to exit gracefully for some of the errors - as this wont catch errors like segmentation fault.\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/helloahn>@helloahn</denchmark-link>\n  can you verify if its the same case of Caffe2 as well?\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "kparichay", "commentT": "2019-10-21T16:22:49Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t : Thank you for posting issue <denchmark-link:https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer/issues/1809>#1809</denchmark-link>\n .
