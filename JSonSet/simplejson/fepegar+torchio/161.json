I've used it today for the first time, and (almost) all functionality worked as intended.\n I've stumbled upon a little problem with regard to custom transformations using torchio.transforms.Lambda. When using the function as shown in the docs example, e.g.\n new_mask = Lambda(my_func, types_to_apply=[torchio.LABEL])\n the function is never called for torchio.LABEL. With torchio.INTENSITY it works fine.\n A look at the implementation (torchio/transforms/lambda_transform.py) showed that Lambda.apply_transfom() goes through images via sample.get_images(). However, get_images() has a default flag intensity_only=True. As such, only torchio.INTENSITY can be retrieved, making the option types_to_apply obsolete.\n Is this intended behaviour? Thanks for looking into it!\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "marcfi", "commentT": "2020-05-23T06:24:00Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHi <denchmark-link:https://github.com/marcfi>@marcfi</denchmark-link>\n , thanks for the kind words.
