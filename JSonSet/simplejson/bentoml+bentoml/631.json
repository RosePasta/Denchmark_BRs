I have received the botocore.exceptions.ClientError indicating there's (NoSuchBucket) when calling the GetBuckAcl Operations and InvalidLocationConstraint when calling the CreateBucket Operations. Any tips in regards to this? Is there like a parameter that i can use to create this bucket?\n <denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22229998/81140501-1f3d4280-8f9c-11ea-9b0e-ce2306701b50.png></denchmark-link>\n \n Thanks!\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "jjneojiajun", "commentT": "2020-05-06T19:47:25Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\thi <denchmark-link:https://github.com/jjneojiajun>@jjneojiajun</denchmark-link>\n  what is the region you are trying to deploy to?\n There is an ongoing issue on boto3 that create an S3 bucket will fail for region  that I am not aware,  <denchmark-link:https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/125>boto/boto3#125</denchmark-link>\n .
