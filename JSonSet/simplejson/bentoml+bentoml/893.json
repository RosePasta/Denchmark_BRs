This causes problems when content type is provided as lowercase, or is missing completely. According to the RFC specs, header names are case insensitive, which is also a problem.\n This was changed in a previous version of BentoML, where it was assumed that the input is valid json unless the json.loads raised an exception. I would suggest returning to that behavior, since testing for the content-type in this way is not robust.\n I can provide a PR for the JsonInput adapter, but would recommend that this becomes part of the spec for any adapter, since this is also repeated (I think) in the DataFrame adapter.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "omrihar", "commentT": "2020-07-15T15:13:28Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for reporting this <denchmark-link:https://github.com/omrihar>@omrihar</denchmark-link>\n \n The previous version of BentoML actually handles input JSON the exact same way in , you can find the implementation in  file, which is identical to the old JsonHandler/JsonInput.

For headers, it is still in the format of the income client request header.\n \n \n I found the documentation about this topic here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-input-format\n \n Based on this, I think it should work when it is in lower case but it doesn't seem to handle when the content-type is missing. I think in the case of JsonInput, we should assume the content-type is JSON when it is missing.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "31c47d9124eb97a54b54b898786048c79882118a", "commit_author": "Omri Har-Shemesh", "commitT": "2020-08-01 11:00:05-07:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "bentoml\\adapters\\json_input.py", "file_new_name": "bentoml\\adapters\\json_input.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "116,118,119", "deleted_lines": "115,117,118,119,120,121", "method_info": {"method_name": "handle_aws_lambda_event", "method_params": "self,event,func", "method_startline": "115", "method_endline": "122"}}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "tests\\adapters\\test_json_handler.py", "file_new_name": "tests\\adapters\\test_json_handler.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "41,42,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,58", "deleted_lines": "41,42,48", "method_info": {"method_name": "test_json_handle_aws_lambda_event", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "23", "method_endline": "58"}}}}}}}
