I did everything written in the README, but still got errors that did little to figure out what went wrong. Only later I've learned that also python3.6-dev is required - at least for my environment. (thanks <denchmark-link:https://github.com/ofirzaf>@ofirzaf</denchmark-link>\n  )\n If python-dev really is a dependency, perhaps it should be reflected better for a newbie like me in the README installation instructions. Possibly, even throw AssertionError or warning from setup.py. Ideally, Python.h wouldn't be a dependency unless compilation is required to build the repo, but that's a discussion for another thread.\n I'm running: Ubuntu16.04 with Python3.6 in a clean virtualenv with latest pip.\n \t"}, "comments": {}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "8aa6810ef5b655ec966cc510233b8bdb6ee29c74", "commit_author": "Peter Izsak", "commitT": "2019-11-25 16:12:40+02:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "docs-source\\source\\installation.rst", "file_new_name": "docs-source\\source\\installation.rst", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "25,35,39,61,62", "deleted_lines": "37,59,60"}}}}}}
