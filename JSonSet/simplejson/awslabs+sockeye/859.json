The metrics file will have info for 10 checkpoints, and the latest params file will be params.00010.\n Now, suppose you continue training and stop after an additional 10 checkpoints. The metrics file will have info for 19 checkpoints, and the latest params file will be params.00020. The line that was lost was the line corresponding to params.00010. All of the lines from the 10'th on are now incorrect. Line (9+n) of the metrics file actually contains information about checkpoint (9 + n + 1).\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "tuglat", "commentT": "2020-08-27T08:06:55Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHi <denchmark-link:https://github.com/tuglat>@tuglat</denchmark-link>\n  thanks for reporting this issue!
