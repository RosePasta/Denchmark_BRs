Later, when the port is allocated to another container, it will throw port unavailable error and fail the container.\n After reading some source code, I found that when processing a heartbeat from NodeManager, ResourceManager will send event NODE_RESOURCE_UPDATE to scheduler only when gpu capacity has changed, otherwise the localUsedPortSnapshot will only be recorded in RMNode. Since the gpu capacity has not changed, the scheduler won't be notified that the port assigned to docker is unavailable.\n Is that the reason of this issue?\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/mzmssg>@mzmssg</denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "chenqy930", "commentT": "2019-01-14T05:00:40Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/chenqy930>@chenqy930</denchmark-link>\n \n I also noticed that, we have recorded this issue.\n \t\t"}, "comments_5": {"comment_id": 6, "comment_author": "chenqy930", "commentT": "2019-06-27T06:05:30Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/chenqy930>@chenqy930</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/pai/pull/3012>#3012</denchmark-link>\n  is a cheap workaround by excluding local used port from launcher selection.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "395b5a43ac030bc877972fdff23621e8777b98a8", "commit_author": "Ziming Miao", "commitT": "2019-06-27 17:21:53+08:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "src\\hadoop-ai\\build\\build-pre.sh", "file_new_name": "src\\hadoop-ai\\build\\build-pre.sh", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "25", "deleted_lines": "25"}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "src\\hadoop-ai\\build\\build.sh", "file_new_name": "src\\hadoop-ai\\build\\build.sh", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "39", "deleted_lines": null}}}, "file_2": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "src\\hadoop-ai\\build\\hadoop-ai", "file_new_name": "src\\hadoop-ai\\build\\hadoop-ai", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "76", "deleted_lines": "76,77,78,79,80,81,82"}}}, "file_3": {"file_change_type": "ADD", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "None", "file_new_name": "src\\hadoop-ai\\build\\hadoop-ai-port-conflict.patch"}}}}
