Though I was thinking more along the lines of preventing the user from entering a large message in the first place by imposing a character limit on the text input widget (basically ignoring input if the size of the entered message is already 500 chars). It may even be good to show a little counter for how many characters are left, sort of like on Twitter. (Just throwing ideas/suggestions out there! :D)\n That way, the app doesn't lag/Olivia doesn't take a long time to respond.
