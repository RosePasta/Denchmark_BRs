Model saver + visualizing test set can easily take more than ten seconds. (Since they use different dataflows it thinks the training one has timed out since it hasn't received anything in 10+ seconds). Model saving alone can easily take 10 seconds if you are saving over the network. Maybe you need to add an exception to the timeout for callbacks?\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "eb0aa840734fb4bb8994c43ea098de5ecbd1ef8f", "commit_author": "Yuxin Wu", "commitT": "2017-07-05 12:14:33-07:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "tensorpack\\train\\input_source.py", "file_new_name": "tensorpack\\train\\input_source.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "197", "deleted_lines": "191,192,193,200,203,204", "method_info": {"method_name": "run", "method_params": "self", "method_startline": "189", "method_endline": "207"}}}}}}}
