If Z must always have the same size than X, then the Pow operator is \"only\" unidirectional broadcastable rather that multidirectional, right? I mean, if Pow was multidirectional, then Z would not necessarily have the same size than X, but rather the same size than either X or Y (or both if they have the same size), am I correct?\n Thanks!\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "gineshidalgo99", "commentT": "2020-09-04T17:05:12Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHI <denchmark-link:https://github.com/gineshidalgo99>@gineshidalgo99</denchmark-link>\n ,\n I think you are right. Since  does support multidirectional, the size of Z is  have the same size than X. The description for Z needs to be corrected for ,  and . I will send a PR to update the document.
