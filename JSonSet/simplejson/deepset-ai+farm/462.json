The error was indeed caused by the lack of adding the encoding during open write file. I created a new PR (after closing the old one. I don't know if this is needed. The old PR would pull from a branch that has been merged with master, whereas the new PR will pull from master). However, I noticed something else during the process, which I will create a new issue for that.\n For cases like this, where I report a bug, as well as create a PR with the solution for the bug, should I then close this issue after submitting the PR? Or should I just leave the issue like this and let you guys close this issue?\n \t\t"}, "comments_5": {"comment_id": 6, "comment_author": "lingsond", "commentT": "2020-07-20T07:56:20Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHey lingsond, no worries, always happy to help.\n \n The old PR would pull from a branch that has been merged with master, whereas the new PR will pull from master\n If there are no conflicts github is taking care of it automatically. If there are merge conflicts the github UI will also show it. Then you should merge the latest master into your fork (that way you dont have to create a new PR but just update the old one).\n \n And in the PR you can link issues with the hashtag.
