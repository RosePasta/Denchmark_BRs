My way to fix it was to change all calls to train_data, test_data, train_labels and test_labels to just data and targets. The model trains but I am not able to replicate Kingma's results. Let me know if it fixes your problem and if you are able to replicate their results.\n Best,\n Sergio\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "BeginnerAI", "commentT": "2019-03-18T17:32:28Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI think this is due to a recent change in .

We need to update the data loading utility class for SS-VAE to be compatible with the latest torchvision package or deprecate that dependency altogether. In the meantime, I think downgrading that dependency should work.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "89ad6bbb9aef3e09ea12e3261eb1d804b0411c54", "commit_author": "Neeraj Pradhan", "commitT": "2019-04-22 18:27:37-04:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "examples\\vae\\utils\\mnist_cached.py", "file_new_name": "examples\\vae\\utils\\mnist_cached.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "149,151,157,162,165,167,170,173,178,180", "deleted_lines": "149,151,157,162,165,167,170,173,178,180", "method_info": {"method_name": "__init__", "method_params": "self,mode,sup_num,use_cuda,args,kwargs", "method_startline": "131", "method_endline": "180"}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "188,190", "deleted_lines": "188,190", "method_info": {"method_name": "__getitem__", "method_params": "self,index", "method_startline": "182", "method_endline": "193"}}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "setup.py", "file_new_name": "setup.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "63", "deleted_lines": "63"}}}}}}
