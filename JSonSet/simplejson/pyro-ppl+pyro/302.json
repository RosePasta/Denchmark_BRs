There would be no easy way to fill in a 2x3 matrix with different param values per row for instance. If we are using this, then we should throw a strong warning when the uses supplies anything other than a 1 dimensional parameter value (which kind of defeats the whole point of using the tensor distribution library :) ).\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "neerajprad", "commentT": "2017-10-21T01:15:07Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tyes i will own fixing this\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "0f1d27e81213d548d4ddcd65d19c15156dabf59a", "commit_author": "Jonathan", "commitT": "2017-10-24 17:51:27-07:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "pyro\\distributions\\cauchy.py", "file_new_name": "pyro\\distributions\\cauchy.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "74,75,76,79,80,81", "deleted_lines": "68,69,80", "method_info": {"method_name": "batch_log_pdf", "method_params": "self,x,mu,gamma", "method_startline": "68", "method_endline": "81"}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "62,63,64,65", "deleted_lines": "61,62,63,64,65,66", "method_info": {"method_name": "sample", "method_params": "self,mu,gamma", "method_startline": "56", "method_endline": "66"}}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "tests\\distributions\\conftest.py", "file_new_name": "tests\\distributions\\conftest.py", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "114,115,116,118", "deleted_lines": "114,116"}}}}}}
