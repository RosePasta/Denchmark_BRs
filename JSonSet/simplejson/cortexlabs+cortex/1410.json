When an environment is added or updated, the cached version modified and then written to disk. It is possible for the cached version to be out of sync with the actual environments file, especially for long running commands such as cortex cluster up. Refresh the cache before updating the environments file or get rid of the caching entirely.\n \t"}, "comments": {}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "7a70b165bed310eea71125ec2ec08c6a91bd17ff", "commit_author": "David Eliahu", "commitT": "2020-11-06 17:18:03-05:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "cli\\cmd\\lib_cli_config.go", "file_new_name": "cli\\cmd\\lib_cli_config.go", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": null, "deleted_lines": "976", "method_info": {"method_name": "writeCLIConfig", "method_params": "CLIConfig", "method_startline": "963", "method_endline": "978"}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": null, "deleted_lines": "917,918,919,920,941,959", "method_info": {"method_name": "readCLIConfig", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "916", "method_endline": "961"}}}}}}}
