AutoGluon has been changed to be a namespace package in preparation for v0.1 release, meaning it is now made up of several separate packages. However, having both autogluon==0.0.14 (non-namespace) and autogluon.core (namespace) installed creates a namespace collision. Because autogluon==0.0.14 installs 'gluoncv>=0.5.0,<1.0',, it installs the new gluoncv==0.9.0 which creates the namespace collision and breaks the package.\n The following installation process works:\n <denchmark-code># Optionally upgrade pip for faster install and newer mxnet version\n python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n \n python3 -m pip install \"mxnet<2.0.0\"\n python3 -m pip install \"gluoncv>=0.5.0,<0.9.0\"\n python3 -m pip install autogluon\n </denchmark-code>\n \n To fix a pre-existing broken environment:\n <denchmark-code>python3 -m pip uninstall autogluon.core\n python3 -m pip uninstall autogluon\n python3 -m pip uninstall gluoncv\n python3 -m pip install \"gluoncv>=0.5.0,<0.9.0\"\n python3 -m pip install autogluon\n </denchmark-code>\n \n We will plan to release v0.0.15 ASAP (within the next 24 hours) to resolve this issue by updating the gluoncv version band to not include v0.9.0.\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "TommasoBendinelli", "commentT": "2020-12-08T19:26:11Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThis issue has been fixed with the release of <denchmark-link:https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon/releases/tag/v0.0.15>v0.0.15</denchmark-link>\n .
