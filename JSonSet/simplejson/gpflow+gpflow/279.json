It will be obvious how to add the notebook when you open the file :)\n You could also modify doc/source/intro.rst, thich contains some description of the project, and what's included. Suggest you update this also.\n To build the docs, install the dependencies\n <denchmark-code>pip install sphinx nbsphinx numpydoc\n </denchmark-code>\n \n Then from the doc directory, type make html and the open doc/build/index.html\n Once the edits are pushed to master, they will appear automatically within a few minutes on readthedocs.org. If you'd like access to GPflow on readthedocs.org, which will let you automatically build docs on branches, make an account there and I will give you access.\n James.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "jameshensman", "commentT": "2017-01-12T17:35:58Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI think this is a bug as intro.rst points to the GPLVM notebook.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "b970ee62ca16cadd04a7c08f5f73dcfeac46ee17", "commit_author": "Alexis Boukouvalas", "commitT": "2017-01-13 14:49:06+00:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "doc\\source\\index.rst", "file_new_name": "doc\\source\\index.rst", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "29", "deleted_lines": null}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "doc\\source\\intro.rst", "file_new_name": "doc\\source\\intro.rst", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "33,59", "deleted_lines": "33,59"}}}, "file_2": {"file_change_type": "RENAME", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "notebooks\\coreg_demo.ipynb", "file_new_name": "doc\\source\\notebooks\\coreg_demo.ipynb"}}}}
