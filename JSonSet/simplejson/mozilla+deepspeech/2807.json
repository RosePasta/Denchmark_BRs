If the scorer has not been downloaded via git lfs, the error message ValueError: Scorer initialization failed with error code 1 will appear. This is not a very helpful error message and I feel that a better message that actually describes the problem and how to solve it would be better and prevent this question being asked so many times.\n This also only occurs at the end of training, so you have to wait for training to complete before realizing you haven't installed the scorer. Perhaps if the user has specified the test pass it should check the scorer is correct at startup?\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "dabinat", "commentT": "2020-03-04T21:30:02Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t\n Perhaps if the user has specified the test pass it should check the scorer is correct at startup?\n \n Might be a good idea.\n \n This also only occurs at the end of training, so you have to wait for training to complete before realizing you haven't installed the scorer.\n \n Also, since there are checkpoints, is this really a big deal ?
