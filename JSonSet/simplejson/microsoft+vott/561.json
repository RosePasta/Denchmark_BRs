Please describe.\n My first time downloading VoTT I went to create a new project but was unsuccessful because I hadn't created connections before attempting to create the new project. I did see that in the documentation it said that connections were required to create a new project, but I didn't see that until after the fact. Currently when I just create a new project without any connections I click \"Save Project\" and nothing happens.\n Describe the solution you'd like\n It would be nice if an error message came up saying that connections are required to create a project (similar to how one comes up if you try to create a project without a name)\n Describe alternatives you've considered\n Additional context\n Even though it does say it's required in the documentation, I read through all the documentation before playing around with it and still got stumped (it's tough to remember all of the details). It's also safe to say a decent portion of folks will not read the documentation at all.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "alancast", "commentT": "2019-02-11T23:06:33Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for your feedback <denchmark-link:https://github.com/alancast>@alancast</denchmark-link>\n .
