During training, the model is fed images resized down to 256x256, so there will be no benefit of providing content or style images larger than this. You can still stylize images of any size.\n So, one thing you could try is to scale the images down. You can do that for instance doing:\n images = tc.load_images('images/')\n images['image'] = images['image'].apply(lambda img: tc.image_analysis.resize(img, 256, 256, 3))\n images.save('resized.sframe')\n Now, you can load that SFrame directly in your training script. This is actually what we do at the onset of training, but I'm worried that we are still keeping the hi-res images around in memory.\n Also, the warnings that you mentioned are not important. The  seems unrelated to Turi Create, since we do not depend on that package. When loading images, it will warn every time it sees a file that was not PNG or JPEG, but this is safe to ignore.
