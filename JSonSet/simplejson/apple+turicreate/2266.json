The specific part of this is that commit 4c43bc upgrades the march target to nehalem, which includes the SSE 4.2 and POPCNT/LZCNT instructions, which we use in some of the core routines. The rather ancient Xeon E5420 processor does not have these.  It's possible to compile an egg with a legacy version of all of these, but our newer dependencies will also start requiring some of these instructions, so changing this on our end might not solve all of this and also may impact performance of some routines.\n It's unclear what to do here.\n \t\t"}, "comments_5": {"comment_id": 6, "comment_author": "halilkabaca", "commentT": "2019-11-07T23:12:34Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tKeeping open during 6.0 to evaluate instruction set compatibility with manylinux2010.\n \t\t"}, "comments_6": {"comment_id": 7, "comment_author": "halilkabaca", "commentT": "2019-11-21T23:21:22Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tBRB: manylinux2010 now dictates what instruction sets we support, we should follow this.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "d0a5e5ec9a4a2a75a73be61c441678b5b41faceb", "commit_author": "Hoyt Koepke", "commitT": "2019-11-22 14:01:50-08:00", "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "CMakeLists.txt", "file_new_name": "CMakeLists.txt", "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "467,468,471,472,473", "deleted_lines": "467,468,469,470,471,472,474,476,477,478,479,480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487"}}}}}}
