However currently notebook-controller have a dependency on VirtualServices. That's why the test fails for any update on the notebooks-controller image update.\n Kfctl-test performs some component specific tests which is missing in <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/testing/workflows/components/kfctl_go_test.jsonnet>kfctl-go-test</denchmark-link>\n . Therefore, we need to either merge the two tests or install instio on kfctl-test.\n related to <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3306>#3306</denchmark-link>\n \n blocked <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/3318>#3318</denchmark-link>\n \n /cc <denchmark-link:https://github.com/gabrielwen>@gabrielwen</denchmark-link>\n \n /cc <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kunmingg>@kunmingg</denchmark-link>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "zabbasi", "commentT": "2019-05-22T18:51:26Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tIssue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label kind/bug to this issue, with a confidence of 0.65.
