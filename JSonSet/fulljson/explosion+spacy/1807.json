I can see that the words and vectors look fine as I read them in, e.g.\n <denchmark-code>...\n leicht\n [ 0.36014  0.18184 -0.11139 -0.12497 -0.13684 ...]\n besitz\n [-0.04354     0.15431    -0.13097    -0.23924001 -0.14453  ... ]\n ...\n </denchmark-code>\n \n but after each iteration, the vocab size remains at 173, all of which seem to be pre-defined terms, maybe for the tokenizer? First few: '\u00fc.', 'XD', ';-D', '>:o', ':-)', '<3', ' ', '8)', '\\\\n', 'c.', ':>'\n I first ran into this problem using other code and could reproduce with the example.
