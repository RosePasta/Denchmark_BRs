Anyway I've got a comment loosely related to personal pronoun lemmas. My first language is Polish, a morphologically rich language. Polish adjective inflects for number, gender and case. In noun phrases adjective gender depends on the gender of the noun being the syntactic head of the noun (strictly speaking, adjectives and noun agree on number, gender and grammatical case). So, aside for picking nominative case, there is no proper way to decide which adjective form should be used as lemma. The tradition has it masculine, singular, nominative \u2014 both in old dictionaries and in modern tagsets. Similar situation happens for other Slavic languages (e.g. Slovene, Czech, Croatian).\n BTW in the tagset of the National Corpus of Polish, 3rd person pronouns are lemmatised to the male form, also (<denchmark-link:http://nkjp.pl/poliqarp/help/ense2.html#x3-20002>http://nkjp.pl/poliqarp/help/ense2.html#x3-20002</denchmark-link>\n , see ppron3). In the case of the MULTEXT-East tagset, the decisions made differ (<denchmark-link:http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/msd/html/index.html>http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/msd/html/index.html</denchmark-link>\n ).
