I've now run into the root cause once again: unexpectedly missing language models. I believe I've identified the reason. When installing models for either 'en' or 'de' with the --force option, all models are removed. I would expect it to only overwrite (remove then download) the models for the particular language.\n Here's an example:\n <denchmark-code>~$ python -m spacy.en.download all --force\n Downloading parsing model\n Downloading...\n Downloaded 532.28MB 100.00% 3.75MB/s eta 0s\n archive.gz checksum/md5 OK\n Model successfully installed to /Users/burtondewilde/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/spacy/data\n Downloading GloVe vectors\n Downloading...\n Downloaded 708.08MB 100.00% 2.65MB/s eta 0s\n archive.gz checksum/md5 OK\n Model successfully installed to /Users/burtondewilde/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/spacy/data\n ~$ ls /Users/burtondewilde/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/spacy/data\n __cache__  cookies.txt  en-1.1.0  en_glove_cc_300_1m_vectors-1.0.0\n ~$ python -m spacy.de.download all --force\n Downloading...\n Downloaded 644.23MB 100.00% 9.51MB/s eta 0s\n archive.gz checksum/md5 OK\n Model successfully installed to /Users/burtondewilde/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/spacy/data\n ~$ ls /Users/burtondewilde/.pyenv/versions/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/spacy/data\n __cache__  cookies.txt  de-1.0.0\n </denchmark-code>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "bdewilde", "commentT": "2016-10-25T19:23:22Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tOn a related note: While it's good that models that don't exist aren't loaded and then incorrectly applied, it's still a bit surprising when the models in a pipeline are silently not applied. Maybe a one-time warning message indicating that the model was not found and thus could not be applied would clarify things?\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "bdewilde", "commentT": "2016-10-26T10:55:49Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tspaCy should probably do a bit more logging, yes.\n To clarify a bit about what's changed: previously, you had to download the data to even get the tokenizer. This was definitely unnecessary. The 1.0 release comes with a lot of language data packaged into code, so that you can get basic usage without the data download. The idea is to support people who just need a tokenizer etc.\n The downside is that now the user can be in two states: data present or data absent. This bug you've highlighted makes the problem much much worse. Clearly we'll fix the bug. But what about the two states?\n One solution is to log a warning, as you're suggesting. Probably that's best. Another solution is to make the user explicitly ask for the 'micro' state, and raise if they're trying to 'load' but can't. A related solution is to raise when an attribute that would be predicted by a model, e.g. a POS tag, is missing. Both of these seem to not work well if we want to assume that the pipeline is a flexible, user-defined thing. We can't map the attribute \"tag\" back to the action of nlp.tagger() if the pipeline is flexible/arbitrary.\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "bdewilde", "commentT": "2016-11-04T09:46:29Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThis should be fixed now, although it's hard to test for, so I'll just cross my fingers...\n This took a surprisingly long time to sort out, because I still find the sputnik codebase very difficult.\n \t\t"}, "comments_3": {"comment_id": 4, "comment_author": "bdewilde", "commentT": "2018-05-09T06:39:07Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThis thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
