These are words like \" car\" and \" car\", which UD lists as examples of determiners (<denchmark-link:https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/DET.html>link</denchmark-link>\n ).\n I also noticed some old information on the annotation specifications page:\n <denchmark-link:https://spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging>https://spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging</denchmark-link>\n \n Specifically, the header in the Universal Part-of-speech Tags tab says you use the Universal Dependencies scheme, while the headers in the English and German tabs say you use the Google Universal Tagset. The latter is no longer true (although maybe it is for German?)!\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "chrisjbryant", "commentT": "2019-10-22T07:15:06Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for bringing this up again!
