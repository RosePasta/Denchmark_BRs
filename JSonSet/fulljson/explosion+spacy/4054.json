Thanks for the detailed explanation :-)\n I was testing this in the context of serializing the KnowledgeBase for the entity linking functionality. To read the KB back in, you need at least the original vocab object, or otherwise the corresponding nlp object you used to create the KB with.\n Because you have the option of loading the KB back in with the vocab only, you can then also create a blank English model with this vocab and create a new entity_linking pipe and have a functional pipeline, at least for demonstration purposes (in practice you'd need ner too, ofcourse).\n See here: <denchmark-link:https://github.com/svlandeg/spaCy/blob/feature/el-docs/examples/training/train_entity_linker.py>https://github.com/svlandeg/spaCy/blob/feature/el-docs/examples/training/train_entity_linker.py</denchmark-link>\n \n This works, but the IO doesn't because of the reasons described above.\n But if you think that use-case is not relevant, we can just assume we always have access to the original nlp object with the right vocab...\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "svlandeg", "commentT": "2019-08-31T15:42:33Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThis thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
