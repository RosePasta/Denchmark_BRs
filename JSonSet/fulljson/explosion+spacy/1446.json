When making these calls, the status code needs to be checked, in case the user is out of memory. Currently some of these checks are missing, leading to segmentation faults instead of graceful errors.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "honnibal", "commentT": "2018-05-08T13:27:19Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThis thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
