There's no equivalent logic within textcat.begin_training(), which means the vectors aren't loaded in this way.\n The workaround is to add the keyword argument to the call: textcat.begin_training(pretrained_vectors=nlp.vocab.vectors.name)\n This bug should be resolved by making sure the components' .begin_training() methods infer the value for pretrained_vectors if it's missing. If the keyword has the argument pretrained_vectors=False or pretrained_vectors=None, we should avoid using the pretrained vectors.\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "romlatron", "commentT": "2019-07-24T08:18:12Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI still didn't get it to work, calling nlp.begin_training(pretrained_vectors=nlp.vocab.vectors.name) and then nlp.update(), the component still doesn't depend on the vocabulary of the model when I call it.\n I originally use Prodigy for model training so I am a bit unclear on how it all works here, is it better to call textcat.begin_training() instead?\n \t\t"}, "comments_3": {"comment_id": 4, "comment_author": "romlatron", "commentT": "2019-08-01T13:46:14Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHi,\n It still doesn't work for me using nlp.begin_training(pretrained_vectors=nlp.vocab.vectors.name), is there something I could possibly forget?\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "romlatron", "commentT": "2019-08-01T13:54:32Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThe pretrained_vectors parameter should only be nessesary if calling textcat.begin_training not nlp.begin_training.\n Could you add some more code to show how you're loading your model and trying to train it?\n \t\t"}, "comments_5": {"comment_id": 6, "comment_author": "romlatron", "commentT": "2019-08-01T14:39:38Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for the answer, here is the training code adapted from the example shown on Spacy's website:\n <denchmark-code>    nlp = spacy.load(model)\n     textcat = TextCategorizer(nlp.vocab)\n     textcat.add_label(label)\n     nlp.pipeline.append(('textcat', textcat))\n     (train_texts, train_cats), (dev_texts, dev_cats) = load_data(label)\n \n     train_data = list(zip(train_texts, [{\"cats\": cats} for cats in train_cats]))\n \n     # get names of other pipes to disable them during training\n     other_pipes = [pipe for pipe in nlp.pipe_names if pipe != \"textcat\"]\n     with nlp.disable_pipes(*other_pipes):  # only train textcat\n         optimizer = nlp.begin_training(pretrained_vectors=nlp.vocab.vectors.name)\n         batch_sizes = compounding(4.0, 32.0, 1.001)\n         for i in range(n_iter):\n             losses = {}\n             # batch up the examples using spaCy's minibatch\n             random.shuffle(train_data)\n             batches = minibatch(train_data, size=batch_sizes)\n             for batch in batches:\n                 texts, annotations = zip(*batch)\n                 nlp.update(texts, annotations, sgd=optimizer, losses=losses)\n </denchmark-code>\n \n I tried calling nlp.begin_training with no arguments but it doesn't work either.\n \t\t"}, "comments_6": {"comment_id": 7, "comment_author": "romlatron", "commentT": "2019-08-19T09:25:48Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHi, could I get any update on this?
