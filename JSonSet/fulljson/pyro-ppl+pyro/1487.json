The reason for this is that the step size is becoming extremely small in the adaptation phase, and we end up crawling to a halt. Note that the test runs fine without JIT. This probably points to some incompatibility in the adaptation code w.r.t. the assumptions that the JIT is making. This is likely a regression due to some of our internal changes / refactoring of the code, since these tests were working earlier for the most part. cc. <denchmark-link:https://github.com/fehiepsi>@fehiepsi</denchmark-link>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "neerajprad", "commentT": "2018-10-24T13:23:14Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/neerajprad>@neerajprad</denchmark-link>\n  I would like to resolve this bug to learn a bit about jit (I have no idea how it works at the moment ^___^!).

You will need to checkout the  branch to get all the JIT related changes (see the corresponding PR <denchmark-link:https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/1431>#1431</denchmark-link>\n ). You will also need to be on PyTorch master (or download the nightly build using , though it might have a few perf issues that are being worked on). You can run all jit tests using . Since that takes a bit of time, for the purpose of debugging, I would suggest running the JIT tests directly from  and .\n All that does, is JIT the potential energy computation when run the first time, and use the compiled version subsequently. You can toggle off the JIT warnings by setting ignore_jit_warnings=True, which should be the case for some of these tests.

Moving the discussion from the gist so that I can get notified.\n The following snippet from your example has the same issue, but I have not been able to figure out a smaller example that is independent of poutine.trace.
