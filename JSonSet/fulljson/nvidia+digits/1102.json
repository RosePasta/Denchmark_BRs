In some cases a user may need to do training only without validation (maybe because the user merged validation and training sets for generating a final model, or to do faster training). Additionally sometimes the user could use a shared validation set across different versions of training sets, which would lead to data duplication in the current setup.\n Thanks you.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "sherifshehata", "commentT": "2016-09-21T09:41:03Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHi <denchmark-link:https://github.com/sherifshehata>@sherifshehata</denchmark-link>\n  are you referring to the Object Detection workflow?\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "sherifshehata", "commentT": "2016-09-21T11:18:44Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tYes.
