On Windows I saw the bug occurred in the default configuration as well as if I moved all the import down inside the  function.\n The last alternative (which I didn't test) is to move them inside the train() function itself, which seems to be the recommended solution from the pytorch repo, but this would mean that everyone on unix and mac would also then be forced to reimport all the packages multiple times when using --evolve, so I'm a bit stuck.\n I wonder if this is affecting our Windows training speed.
