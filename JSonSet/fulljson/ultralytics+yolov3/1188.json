Although it seems that FPS is not the maximum.\n However, for the HTTP stream, this change is critical, turning the video into a slide show.\n An attempt to examine the LoadStreams class indicates that this might be threading.thread related. Is it possible that streams can layer information on each other when outputting to cv2?\n Because the debugging of the detector shows the correct change in all data and images.\n Unfortunately, I don\u2019t understand well in threading, so I ask perhaps naive or stupid questions.\n \t\t"}, "comments_9": {"comment_id": 10, "comment_author": "Chris7911", "commentT": "2020-06-02T18:18:26Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/droogg>@droogg</denchmark-link>\n  yes, these are simply two different dataloaders.

It could be that inference is being run on a loop on older frames in the absence of updates.\n LoadStreams() runs inference 100% of the time, irrespective of whether the batch contains new frames or not.\n \t\t"}, "comments_10": {"comment_id": 11, "comment_author": "Chris7911", "commentT": "2020-06-03T06:33:29Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/glenn-jocher>@glenn-jocher</denchmark-link>\n  Thank you very much for your quick and clear answer!\n Yes, I understand what you are talking about. Also, your words about output on old frames have some meaning for me. Moreover, each new bounding box appears inside the old one, which indicates that the detector receives not the previous frame, but its modified version, on which the bounding box is already drawn using cv2.\n The function plot_one_box changes the image itself, not its copy. Therefore, if we pass this function not the image itself, but a copy of it, and draw this copy, then the original will not be changed.\n Indeed, if I change part of the code:\n <denchmark-code>            if webcam:  # batch_size >= 1\n                 p, s, im0 = path[i], '%g: ' % i, im0s[0]\n </denchmark-code>\n \n to:\n <denchmark-code>            if webcam:  # batch_size >= 1\n                 p, s, im0 = path[i], '%g: ' % i, im0s[0].copy()\n </denchmark-code>\n \n I get output as expected using the LoadStreams class and threads. This solves the output problem for me. Perhaps this will be useful for the project or people who are facing the same problem as me.\n It is well known that threads are not an absolutely good solution in all cases. I also notice that the LoadWebcam class works much better on my webcam, and the LoadStreams class works better on the HTTP stream. With what it can be connected? And wouldn\u2019t it be the best option to suggest the user to choose a method of loading a video stream?\n \t\t"}, "comments_11": {"comment_id": 12, "comment_author": "Chris7911", "commentT": "2020-06-03T06:53:17Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/droogg>@droogg</denchmark-link>\n  ah of course, that makes perfect sense! We are modifying the original, and then if it is not replaced, inference runs on the modified image, which also explains the reason the box shifts slightly each new frame. It keeps happening until the stream finally downloads a new frame.\n About your last comment, theoretically the multithread solution should have a higher throuput capability, as it loads and preprocesses images in background threads rather than in the main thread, but yes as you see it adds complication as well so in some situations the simple loadwebcam() method is better.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "82f653b0f579db97f8908800d45e8f5287f79bd3", "commit_author": "Glenn Jocher", "commitT": "2020-06-02 23:59:03-07:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "None", "commit_CCN": "None", "commit_Nprams": "None"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "detect.py", "file_new_name": "detect.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "134", "file_CCN": "40", "file_NToken": "1517"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "107", "deleted_lines": "107", "method_info": {"method_name": "detect", "method_params": "save_img", "method_startline": "8", "method_endline": "164", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "106", "method_CCN": "40", "method_NToken": "1149", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}}}}}}
