It would be more efficient for someone else to take this on.\n On another note, you mentioned in another doc issue that it's not worth the effort to go back and fix documentation bugs for non-current TF releases. Instead, is it possible to add a regression test to make sure that documentation doesn't get dropped in new TF releases (like what happened in this issue and  <denchmark-link:https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/32528>#32528</denchmark-link>\n )?\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "sharvil", "commentT": "2019-10-04T14:35:02Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI'll take care of this one.\n For simple things you can often just hit the little \"edit\" button (pencil button).
