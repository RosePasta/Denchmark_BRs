However, the documentation is misleading. For example, if we want the batch normalization layer to normalize over multiple dimensions, the following code is working\n import tensorflow as tf\n layer = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(axis=[0, 2])\n a = layer(tf.random.normal([3, 100, 10]))\n However, the documentation says that the axis argument must be an integer, which confuses me at the beginning. So I have to use a reshape + transpose to implement the same functionality, which is ineffective.\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "vermouth1992", "commentT": "2020-10-14T22:27:51Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for your issue.
