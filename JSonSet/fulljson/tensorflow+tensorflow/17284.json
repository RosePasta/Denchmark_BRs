This is an issue when the graph-level seed has been set to 0, and the provided op-level seed tensor takes on a value of 0. As noted in the comments in the code for tf.get_seed, a (0, 0) seed is problematic because the C++ ops assume this means nondeterminism. Of course, when a user is specifying these seeds, they're expecting deterministic behaviour. Unfortunately, tf.get_seed only checks for this issue for the case where the seeds are ints, not tensors. See the code below for an example.\n I would have been happy to submit a PR for this, but I have no idea where the fix should be for this bug. As I'm not especially familiar with the code base, it's not apparent whether it's even possible to have the code for tf.get_seed to check the value of a tensor seed. If not, I'm guessing the tf.data API would need to provide the checks.\n <denchmark-h:h3>Source code / logs</denchmark-h>\n \n The following code reproduces the bug for me:\n import tensorflow as tf\n \n tf.set_random_seed(0)\n seed_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=[], name='data_seed')\n data = tf.data.Dataset.range(10).shuffle(10, seed=seed_tensor)\n iterator = tf.data.Iterator.from_structure(tf.int64, tf.TensorShape([]))\n \n init = iterator.make_initializer(data)\n value = iterator.get_next()\n \n print('First run: ', end='')\n with tf.Session() as sess1:\n     sess1.run(init, feed_dict={seed_tensor: 0})\n     values = []\n     while True:\n         try:\n             values.append(str(sess1.run(value)))\n         except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:\n             break\n \n     print(', '.join(values))\n \n print('Second run: ', end='')\n with tf.Session() as sess2:\n     sess2.run(init, feed_dict={seed_tensor: 0})\n     values = []\n     while True:\n         try:\n             values.append(str(sess2.run(value)))\n         except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:\n             break\n \n     print(', '.join(values))\n The result I get is:\n <denchmark-code>First run: 8, 4, 6, 9, 1, 0, 5, 7, 3, 2\n Second run: 1, 6, 3, 0, 7, 5, 2, 9, 8, 4\n </denchmark-code>\n \n I would expect the first and second runs to produce the exact same sequence, though the particular sequence might differ from environment to environment.\n If I change the feed_dict to provide a value of 0 for seed_tensor for both runs, I get the expected result:\n <denchmark-code>First run: 5, 2, 0, 1, 7, 4, 9, 3, 8, 6\n Second run: 5, 2, 0, 1, 7, 4, 9, 3, 8, 6\n </denchmark-code>\n \n If I change the shuffle() call to take a value of 0 directly (i.e., `...shuffle(10, seed=0)), I get the expected result as well:\n <denchmark-code>First run: 4, 8, 7, 1, 3, 2, 6, 9, 0, 5\n Second run: 4, 8, 7, 1, 3, 2, 6, 9, 0, 5\n </denchmark-code>\n \n For the record, I encountered this issue because I'm using an Iterator via Iterator.from_structure, and when I use that iterator on a Dataset.shuffle() I get the same order for each epoch. To get around this, I provided the epoch number as a seed to Dataset.shuffle(), with the first epoch being epoch 0. In my case I can avoid this bug by just starting the epoch count at 1, but it took me a while to track down, and there may be other cases where the API is used in a similar way that would be problematic for those expecting deterministic results.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "rightaditya", "commentT": "2018-02-26T23:12:09Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/mrry>@mrry</denchmark-link>\n  Can you look at this?\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "rightaditya", "commentT": "2018-02-26T23:34:03Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI'm a bit confused by the code example.
