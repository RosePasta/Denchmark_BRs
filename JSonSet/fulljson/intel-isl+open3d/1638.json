Apparently, there was some regression at some point. Some time ago there was an example loading the crate.obj object under the test_data dir. Now if you try to load with the original visualizer it doesn't work anymore. With the new visualizer, it does work\n EDIT: I've found a regression (probably when the ASSIMP library was added). I usually use the master branch for Open3D.
