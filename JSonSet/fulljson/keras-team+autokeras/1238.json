When following <denchmark-link:https://github.com/FontTian>@FontTian</denchmark-link>\n  and inserting  into the initialisation of the image classifier, the same error  occurs. Same happens when adding  to ak.ImageClassifier.\n As suggested by <denchmark-link:https://github.com/haifeng-jin>@haifeng-jin</denchmark-link>\n , I ran a basic KerasTuner example on 4 GPUs which worked just fine.
