We believe this error applies to , no matter the language because it is bound to the model capacity (512 in this case).\n After further investigation, we discovered that it is due to the length of the spacy document. In our case we were working with a document totaling 2209 tokens. After the TransformersWordPiecer call, these tokens get converted to 2555 word-piece tokens ready for BERT input.\n It looks like after the maximum model sequence length capacity is reached (512 for BERT) the word-piece token alignments are not being computed at all, resulting in an Exception being raised in wordpiecer.py,  within set_annotations().\n You can replicate this issue by taking any Italian document long enough (i.e. with its word-piece representation longer than 512 - 2 tokens) and running the following snippet:\n <denchmark-code>from spacy_transformers import TransformersLanguage, TransformersWordPiecer, TransformersTok2Vec\n \n doc = open('document.txt').read()\n \n name = \"dbmdz/bert-base-italian-xxl-uncased\"\n \n nlp = TransformersLanguage(trf_name=name, meta={\"lang\": \"it\"})\n nlp.add_pipe(nlp.create_pipe(\"sentencizer\"))\n nlp.add_pipe(TransformersWordPiecer.from_pretrained(nlp.vocab, name))\n nlp.add_pipe(TransformersTok2Vec.from_pretrained(nlp.vocab, name))\n \n nlp(doc)  # Crashes if doc word pieces are more than 510 (512 - 2)\n \n </denchmark-code>\n \n Please note that if the document is shorter, everything works fine.\n For the time being, we found a workaround by manually chopping the document into smaller pieces and calling the pipeline manually, but we would really love to have this fantastic library account for longer documents on its own.\n Thank you, you are amazing.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "ab3llini", "commentT": "2020-06-10T16:04:27Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHi, thanks for the report!
