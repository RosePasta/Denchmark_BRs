I guess we weren't thinking about these non-image yet image-like obs spaces when we wrote this loop (thinking that one would always use more than 1 conv layer). In your case, this is perfectly valid, though. Then again, more than 1 layers may still help here.\n We'll provide a fix. ...\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "jdpena", "commentT": "2020-10-11T10:51:30Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tClosing this.\n PR has been merged:\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/11330>#11330</denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "957877ad3fae729ef11e4fcea7e20e72e2f6a694", "commit_author": "Sven Mika", "commitT": "2020-10-11 12:49:47+02:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "None", "commit_CCN": "None", "commit_Nprams": "None"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "rllib\\models\\tf\\visionnet.py", "file_new_name": "rllib\\models\\tf\\visionnet.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "120", "file_CCN": "4", "file_NToken": "882"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "23,24,69,127", "deleted_lines": "67,125"}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "rllib\\models\\torch\\visionnet.py", "file_new_name": "rllib\\models\\torch\\visionnet.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "161", "file_CCN": "11", "file_NToken": "961"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "27,28", "deleted_lines": null}}}}}}
