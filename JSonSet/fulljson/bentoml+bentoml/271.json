Even when I use BentoML version 0.3.0 I get either of two errors: if I didn't include BentoML in the requirements.txt it doesn't find module BentoML in runtime and throws no such module error, and if I did include it the package size reaches about 66 MB (even though the scikit dependencies is only about 40MB) and it throws the same error as above (/home/sbx_user no such file or directory).\n Is there a version of BentoML where I can verify AWS Lambda deployment for this quick start example to run correctly as-is? I really like your approach guys to this and I think this option specifically could be great running without issues.\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "parano", "commentT": "2019-09-04T01:02:51Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/Mu7ammad>@Mu7ammad</denchmark-link>\n  The last time I tested serverless deployment was BentoML-0.2.0 Beta which should work, you may verify on that branch.  I'd recommend waiting a little bit for next release - We are currently working on a completely revamped deployment implementation coming in our next release, which brought lots of improvements to serverless deployment workflow as well. Would be ideal for you to try out the new implementation and we'd love to hear your feedback as well. Also, make sure to join the slack channel if you plan to use BentoML for production workload!\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "parano", "commentT": "2019-09-10T00:24:38Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/Mu7ammad>@Mu7ammad</denchmark-link>\n   this issue has been fixed in <denchmark-link:https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/pull/284>#284</denchmark-link>\n , the serverless deployment should work end-to-end in next release\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "d1369806ec6751dadc97da4ff0e7bb88147ebf63", "commit_author": "Chaoyu", "commitT": "2019-09-09 16:30:39-07:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "0.18518518518518517", "commit_CCN": "1.0", "commit_Nprams": "1.0"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "bentoml\\__init__.py", "file_new_name": "bentoml\\__init__.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "36", "file_CCN": "0", "file_NToken": "128"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31", "deleted_lines": "24,36,38"}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "bentoml\\cli\\config.py", "file_new_name": "bentoml\\cli\\config.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "106", "file_CCN": "18", "file_NToken": "607"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "27,28", "deleted_lines": "27,28,29,30,31"}}}, "file_2": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "bentoml\\config\\__init__.py", "file_new_name": "bentoml\\config\\__init__.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "52", "file_CCN": "12", "file_NToken": "356"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "56,57,58,59,60,61", "deleted_lines": "56,57,58,59,60,61", "method_info": {"method_name": "get_local_config_file", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "56", "method_endline": "61", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "5", "method_CCN": "2", "method_NToken": "36", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,93,98,99", "deleted_lines": "72,73,74,75,76,77,78,80", "method_info": {"method_name": "load_config", "method_params": "bentoml_home", "method_startline": "72", "method_endline": "99", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "22", "method_CCN": "3", "method_NToken": "140", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}}}, "file_3": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "bentoml\\deployment\\serverless\\aws_lambda.py", "file_new_name": "bentoml\\deployment\\serverless\\aws_lambda.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "180", "file_CCN": "12", "file_NToken": "984"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "48,54,55,56", "deleted_lines": null}}}, "file_4": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "bentoml\\yatai\\__init__.py", "file_new_name": "bentoml\\yatai\\__init__.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "174", "file_CCN": "34", "file_NToken": "1020"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "38", "deleted_lines": "38"}}}}}}
