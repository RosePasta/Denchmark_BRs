I think this is because <denchmark-link:https://github.com/yanniszark>@yanniszark</denchmark-link>\n  already ran into this issue and fixed it in <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/140>kubeflow/manifests#140</denchmark-link>\n ;\n I believe in that PR he moved the PVC definition into the base. The PD overlays are then used to change that PVC to mount a specific PD which is a GCE PD.\n So I think in kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml we just need to not apply those overlays.\n Looking at\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/config/kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml#L51>https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/config/kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml#L51</denchmark-link>\n \n Its not clear to me why it would be applying the <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/master/pipeline/mysql/overlays/mysqlPd>mySqlPd overlay</denchmark-link>\n  since I don't see the overlay parameter specified.\n It looks like\n kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml is still using the deprecated  KfDef.Spec.components, KfDef.Spec.component_params and KfDef.Spec.Packages. We should change that to just using KfDef.Spec.Applications; so that we can easily specify each kustomize package to install. I think that might fix the incorrect overlay being applied.\n If you ran kfctl; it will update KfDef.Spec.Applications so you could just copy that into kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml to update it to use KfDef.Spec.Applications\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/abhi-g>@abhi-g</denchmark-link>\n  Is this the same issue you ran into?\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "krishnadurai", "commentT": "2019-07-31T18:42:26Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThe issue looks similar to what I ran into.

The confusion here was the <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/bootstrap/config/kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml#L48-L51>extra overlay parameters</denchmark-link>\n  mentioned in the config file which led me to believe that this is applying the overlays for mysql and minio components.\n The reason why these PVCs are in the pending state is that in an on-premise environment we need to have a dynamic volume provider like <denchmark-link:https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner>local-path-provisioner</denchmark-link>\n  which detects PVCs which are of default storage class type and provisions required PVs for them. This volume provisioner is available by default in GCP. As soon as we deployed this provisioner in our cluster, I was able to verify all components of Kubeflow are working as intended. We'll make a note of it in the deployment instructions for this config.\n With this <denchmark-link:https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/3792>fix PR</denchmark-link>\n , we have upgraded kfctl_k8s_istio.yaml's kfctl spec to v2 and removed unused parameters like the one mentioned above.
