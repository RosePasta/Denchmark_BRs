My KfDef included component istio.\n I deployed Kubeflow but I saw that Istio was not installed.\n Istio was not installed because it is in package gcp, a package I had not included in KfDef.\n \n What I expected to happen:\n \n Istio should be installed since I specified it in components.\n If Istio (or any component) can't be installed (because it can't be found), kfctl should fail and not succeed.\n \n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "203f8bc8eee86ea78da2dbbb82ff7ff6b8195d72", "commit_author": "Yannis Zarkadas", "commitT": "2019-06-20 09:36:48-07:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "0.0", "commit_CCN": "0.0", "commit_Nprams": "1.0"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "bootstrap\\v2\\pkg\\kfapp\\kustomize\\kustomize.go", "file_new_name": "bootstrap\\v2\\pkg\\kfapp\\kustomize\\kustomize.go", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "941", "file_CCN": "49", "file_NToken": "6259"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218", "deleted_lines": "208,209,210,211,212,213,214", "method_info": {"method_name": "Apply", "method_params": "ResourceEnum", "method_startline": "181", "method_endline": "223", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "42", "method_CCN": "8", "method_NToken": "332", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "424,425,426,427,428,430,431,432,433,434,435,436,437,438,439,440,441,442,443", "deleted_lines": "420,421,422,423,424,425,426,427,429,430,431,432,433,434", "method_info": {"method_name": "error", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "410", "method_endline": "448", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "38", "method_CCN": "7", "method_NToken": "261", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}}}}}}
