I've fixed the issue at <denchmark-link:https://github.com/genicam/harvesters/commit/72b0a78563cde034959a63032aeeaf5faa527cf6>72b0a78</denchmark-link>\n :\n \n Harvester was trying to encode the downloaded XML file retrieving\n its GenTL Producer's char encoding. The encoding is applied on\n the buffers that are defined by the GenTL Standard but not by the\n remote device's XML file. GenICam compliant XML files use UTF-8.\n \n I'd appreciate if you can confirm if it resolves the issue you've faced. If it resolves the issue, please close this ticket.\n Thanks,\n Kazunari\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "72b0a78563cde034959a63032aeeaf5faa527cf6", "commit_author": "kznr", "commitT": "2018-07-20 19:43:35+09:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "None", "commit_CCN": "None", "commit_Nprams": "None"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "harvesters\\core.py", "file_new_name": "harvesters\\core.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "537", "file_CCN": "136", "file_NToken": "3030"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "327", "deleted_lines": "327,328,329,330,331,332,333,334,335,336"}}}}}}
