It seems like when loading the model_definition_file, Ludwig is using , which, according to the <denchmark-link:https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation>pyyaml documentation</denchmark-link>\n , takes a byte string, a Unicode string, an open binary file object, or an open text file object. However, the ludwig documentation says that model_definition_file should be a file path. I tried passing in an open file object and it works.\n I think either the documentation needs to be changed or the model initialization should be modified to actually take a file path instead.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "lingxz", "commentT": "2019-02-14T19:22:19Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for reporting this!
