This makes me totally confused about this game variable.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "NoobFang", "commentT": "2017-06-28T10:45:00Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI have not coded these so I can't give definite answer, however in case of NPC enemies (e.g. defend_the_center, deathmatch) you should define kill rewards in the map's ACS code. Open up one of these scenarios in SLADE, open the ACS code and check how the \"int reward\" is updated.\n By quick peek at code, this is what I gather:\n \n FRAGCOUNT is mostly for multiplayer, e.g. against other players or bots. Does not update from killing NPC(?)\n KILLCOUNT reads \"level.killed_monsters\", so I would guess it updates on killing monsters. However as you pointed out, this does not seem to be the case.\n SECRETCOUNT seems to count the number of \"secret objects\" collected (level.found_secrets), possibly for some \"locate and collect\" task for collecting certain type of pickups.\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "NoobFang", "commentT": "2017-06-28T11:56:26Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/Miffyli>@Miffyli</denchmark-link>\n  ....Thanks for your valuable reply..........\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "NoobFang", "commentT": "2017-06-28T12:13:27Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tHi, all our scenarios already have programmed rewards (see <denchmark-link:https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/blob/master/scenarios/README.md>https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom/blob/master/scenarios/README.md</denchmark-link>\n ).\n Variables behave exactly as described by <denchmark-link:https://github.com/Miffyli>@Miffyli</denchmark-link>\n  (thank you).
