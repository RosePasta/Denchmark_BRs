(so the return for forward is very high (x) and for backward very low (-x) or vice versa)\n As the directions are always sampled the sampling I tried a) to hack the sampling to include always a forward and a backward task and to shuffle the order b) to sample 8 test and train tasks to make sure each direction is at least seen once. The above described behavior of running always into the same direction within one meta-evaluation was observed in both cases.\n Do you have by chance an intuition what might cause this and how to fix it?\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage/files/4558838/pearl_half_cheetah_dir.txt>pearl_half_cheetah_dir.txt</denchmark-link>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "bordeauxred", "commentT": "2020-04-30T16:37:03Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/bordeauxred>@bordeauxred</denchmark-link>\n  thanks for reporting a possible bug!
