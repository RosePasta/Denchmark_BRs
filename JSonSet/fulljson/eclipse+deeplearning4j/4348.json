If someone wants to cross-check with keras that is fine.\n whatever the accuracy of VGG was, perhaps in the 90 percent range, this is just example that is in the 10 percent-ish of somewhat wrong classifications.\n If you wanted to play around, crop the image, or blur some sections to sort out what is triggering the toilet paper or the paper towel.\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "fancyerii", "commentT": "2017-12-01T03:49:50Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/tomthetrainer>@tomthetrainer</denchmark-link>\n  If it's not a bug in the code or the model, then it's a bug\n in the documentation.
