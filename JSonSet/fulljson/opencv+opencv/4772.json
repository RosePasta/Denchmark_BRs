In CMake configuration i just unchecked BUILD_SHARED_LIBS (from default).\n While compiling the libraries only works, executing the \"all\" build tries to compile applications which results in errors because of multiple definitions in libstdc++.a and libstdc++.dll.a.\n As background: TDM-GCC links runtimes statically by default. The compilation of OpenCV applications shows the flag \"-libstdc++\", which forces dynamic linking, while the linked libraries have the static runtime linked -> conflict!\n </denchmark-code>\n \n <denchmark-h:h2>History</denchmark-h>\n \n <denchmark-h:h5>Maksim Shabunin on 2015-04-27 09:11</denchmark-h>\n \n <denchmark-code>-   Target version changed from 3.0-alpha to 3.0\n </denchmark-code>\n \n <denchmark-h:h5>Maksim Shabunin on 2015-04-27 14:38</denchmark-h>\n \n <denchmark-code>-   Target version changed from 3.0 to 2.4.11\n </denchmark-code>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "444593014f6267bd70520fb230cc2d4c2a48b6d8", "commit_author": "jqly", "commitT": "2017-06-30 20:22:16+08:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "None", "commit_CCN": "None", "commit_Nprams": "None"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "cmake\\OpenCVCompilerOptions.cmake", "file_new_name": "cmake\\OpenCVCompilerOptions.cmake", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "None", "file_CCN": "None", "file_NToken": "None"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "251,252,253", "deleted_lines": "251"}}}}}}
