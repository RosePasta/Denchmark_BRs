Looks like Qt 4.8.4 is old version and current one is on 5.4.1. We're spending our investigations on the latest version of Qt with our current compiler. Also worth noting, the crash from the compiler on 4.8.4 is definitely gone and fixed with VS2015 release. Please stay tuned for status on 5.4.1.\n \n Thanks,\n Ulzii Luvsanbat\n Visual C++ Team\n </pre>\n \n You can still use all tests etc. since i am also using VS2015 RC for quite a while.\n As said this is a compiler (rather an optimizer) problem of the vs 2015 internals.\n \n But you are right you can disable both of these things if you want a clean working build.\n </denchmark-code>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "opencv-pushbot", "commentT": "2015-07-31T10:25:48Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThe issue is still present in VS2015 final, but in a slightly reduced form:\n <denchmark-code>C:\\opencv\\opencv-3.0.0\\sources\\modules\\core\\include\\opencv2/core/mat.inl.hpp(1597): error C3861: '.?AV?$Matx@N$01$01@cv@@': identifier not found\n C:\\opencv\\opencv-3.0.0\\sources\\modules\\core\\test\\test_mat.cpp(1216): note: see reference to function template instantiation 'cv::Mat_<double>::operator cv::Matx<double,2,2>(void) const<2,2>' being compiled\n C:\\opencv\\opencv-3.0.0\\sources\\modules\\core\\test\\test_mat.cpp(1216): note: see reference to function template instantiation 'cv::Mat_<double>::operator cv::Matx<double,2,2>(void) const<2,2>' being compiled\n C:\\opencv\\opencv-3.0.0\\sources\\modules\\core\\include\\opencv2/core/mat.inl.hpp(1597): error C2672: 'cv::Mat::operator cv::Matx<double,2,2>': no matching overloaded function found\n </denchmark-code>\n \n The failing code is:\n <denchmark-code>template<typename _Tp> template<int m, int n> inline\n Mat_<_Tp>::operator Matx<typename DataType<_Tp>::channel_type, m, n>() const\n {\n     CV_Assert(n % DataType<_Tp>::channels == 0);\n     // next line fails:\n     Matx<typename DataType<_Tp>::channel_type, m, n> res = this->Mat::operator Matx<typename DataType<_Tp>::channel_type, m, n>();\n     return res;\n }\n </denchmark-code>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "opencv-pushbot", "commentT": "2015-07-31T11:02:51Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tDid you try workaround like this: <denchmark-link:https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/4122/files>https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/4122/files</denchmark-link>\n  ?\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "opencv-pushbot", "commentT": "2015-07-31T11:44:22Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tYes, this fixes the issue.
