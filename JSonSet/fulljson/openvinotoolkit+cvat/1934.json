The annotations are saved in CVAT video 1.1 format. When I uploaded the annotations (saved in a latest develop CVAT version ) to the older version all the frames become key frames and adjusting the boxes becomes very difficult. Could you please resolve the issue.\n <denchmark-h:h3>Expected Behaviour</denchmark-h>\n \n The expected behaviour should be that the key frames should remain same when annotations are uploaded from higher version of CVAT to a lower version. Currently, the backward compatibility is not there. I have build CVAT from the develop branch but on different dates therefore I am using the term \"version\" here. The commits of these version are here.\n Older git commit hash (older version): <denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/commit/47470b84703bfc7bee243b2e7c1ae830ad587885>47470b8</denchmark-link>\n \n New git commit hash  (Newer version):  <denchmark-link:https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/commit/7ecdcf182b1bfae2d29e0f256e025743dd8d198e>7ecdcf1</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-h:h3>Current Behaviour</denchmark-h>\n \n <denchmark-h:h3>Possible Solution</denchmark-h>\n \n <denchmark-h:h3>Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)</denchmark-h>\n \n \n Have both newer version and older version build on a system.\n Annotate any video sequence with tracking enabled (make bboxes over few object and track it) in the newer version.\n Save the annotations in the CVAT 1.1 video format in the newer version.\n Now create a same task in the older version of CVAT and upload the annotations that were saved in newer version.\n Check for the key frames. All the frames will be now key frames instead of a few.\n \n <denchmark-h:h3>Context</denchmark-h>\n \n While doing a review of these tasks the bboxes have to adjusted in all the frames as all the frames are now key frames.\n <denchmark-h:h3>Your Environment</denchmark-h>\n \n \n Git hash commit (git log -1):\n Docker version docker version (e.g. Docker 17.0.05): Docker 19.03.12\n Are you using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes?
