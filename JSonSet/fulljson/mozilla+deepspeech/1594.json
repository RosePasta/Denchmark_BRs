Though, as much as I can tell, in all of the failures reported in the above link, it is when we test the inference on the 44kHz to 16kHz downsampling.\n C++ links directly to libsox while NodeJS and Python more or less relies on stdout of sox binary. Maybe there is a slight variation and it triggers intermittence.\n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "lissyx", "commentT": "2018-09-26T14:11:59Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/files/2420075/LDC93S1.wav.log>LDC93S1.wav.log</denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "lissyx", "commentT": "2018-09-26T14:12:40Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/files/2420085/44k.txt>44k.txt</denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "lissyx", "commentT": "2019-01-02T16:51:06Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThis thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
