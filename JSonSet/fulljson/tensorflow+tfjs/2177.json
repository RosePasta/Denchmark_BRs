I have successfully create the bundle for Release, signed, install it on devices, checked in Android Studio make sure all files (the model files as well) included, but the \"Network fetch error\" still ocurred. So the app could not load model from a relased apk. This applies to both rn 0.59 and 0.60. I am wandering is it the \"paths\" parameters in model.json is not compat with bundled model weight file, because the .bin file name is changed during the bundle process?\n \n My suspection is the react-native-unimodules causes the problem. Because since I upgrade unimodules to 0.7.0, even my rn is 0.59, it still causes the \"fetch\" not working. Currently, only the unimodules version  \"0.5.4\" works for me.\n \n PS:  is it possible to use tf.loadLayersModel() with an URL links to fetch the model from a cloud ? (Azure blob, for example) in tfjs-react-native? It seems from the mobilenet package code that the model from Google's open storage is fetched by using loadGraphModel() from tf.converter, not from tf.\n Many thanks.\n \t\t"}, "comments_11": {"comment_id": 12, "comment_author": "gitathrun", "commentT": "2019-11-06T14:57:13Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI have the same issue  and keep track of discussion!\n \t\t"}, "comments_12": {"comment_id": 13, "comment_author": "gitathrun", "commentT": "2019-11-06T15:14:39Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/gitathrun>@gitathrun</denchmark-link>\n \n \n Could you post the error you seeing RN 0.6x (in debug mode)\n Yep the issue in release mode is due to renaming/moving resources in the bundling process causing the resolved path from RNs resolver to be incorrect.

<denchmark-link:https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/issues/711>fs error</denchmark-link>\n , and react-native-fs documentation is conflect about whether use auto or manul \"react-native link\" cmd if rn version is higher than 0.60. Use \"react-native link react-native-fs\" is obsolutely fine in rn 0.59, but it does not work in 0.60, for some of the configurations does not show in the build.gradle and MainApplication.java.\n Many thanks.\n \t\t"}, "comments_17": {"comment_id": 18, "comment_author": "gitathrun", "commentT": "2019-12-02T16:22:12Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/gitathrun>@gitathrun</denchmark-link>\n  from your error log it looks like the problem is with accessing a microphone (maybe a permissions error)?

It seems related to the use of  to try to turn either a local file or base64 string into a binary stream for consumption by . Code sample:\n <denchmark-code>const convertImageToTensor = async ( image ) => {\n \tconst binary = await fetch( image.uri, {}, { isBinary: true } ); // This is the line that is causing the `Network request failed` error in Android.\n \tconst raw = await binary.arrayBuffer();\n \tconst buffer = new Uint8Array( raw );\n \n \tconst tensor = await decodeJpeg( buffer );\n \n \tclassifyImage( tensor );\n };\n \n // Take a picture using camera component ref and pass to TensorFlow.\n const capturePhoto = async () => {\n \tif ( cameraRef.current ) {\n \t\tconst image = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync( {\n \t\t\tbase64: true,\n \t\t\tdoNotSave: true, // Do not save image file to device disk.\n \t\t\texif: false,\n \t\t\tquality: 0.5\n \t\t} );\n \n \t\tif ( image.base64 ) {\n \t\t\timage.uri = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + image.base64;\n \t\t}\n \n \t\tconvertImageToTensor( image );\n \t}\n };\n </denchmark-code>\n \n This works as expected on iOS, but the XHR request fails on Android. It also fails when trying to fetch a .jpg file from the device's disk, not just when fetching a base64 data URI. I thought it might have been related to this issue: <denchmark-link:https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23986>facebook/react-native#23986</denchmark-link>\n \n but that didn't seem to fix the problem. Debugging the custom fetch function, I saw that the request kept erroring out with a status of 0 before the content type could be determined. I then tried manually setting a content-type header to image/jpeg, but that didn't work either. So I ended up sidestepping the issue by manually building the binary instead:\n <denchmark-code>// Revised function avoiding the use of `fetch` or XHR to convert the image to binary.\n const convertImageToTensor = async ( image ) => {\n \tlet binary,\n \t\traw,\n \t\tbuffer;\n \n \tif ( image.base64 ) {\n \t\tbinary = atob( image.base64 );\n \t\traw = new ArrayBuffer( binary.length );\n \t\tbuffer = new Uint8Array( raw );\n \n \t\tfor ( let i = 0; i < binary.length; i ++ ) {\n \t\t\tbuffer[i] = binary.charCodeAt( i );\n \t\t}\n \n \t\tconst tensor = await decodeJpeg( buffer );\n \n \t\tclassifyImage( tensor );\n \t}\n };\n </denchmark-code>\n \n This seems to work on both iOS and Android. Still, it's more of a workaround than addressing the actual issue with the fetch method.\n \t\t"}, "comments_23": {"comment_id": 24, "comment_author": "gitathrun", "commentT": "2020-01-17T16:33:56Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/dkoo>@dkoo</denchmark-link>\n  thanks for the updated info.
