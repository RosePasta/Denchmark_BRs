This is currently breaking Travis CI builds of master.\n I think there are three possible solutions:\n 1 - Don't run One Shot Unit Tests in Travis CI. We're already not running unit tests for object detection and style transfer (see <denchmark-link:https://github.com/apple/turicreate/issues/1031>#1031</denchmark-link>\n ).\n 2 - Speed up the one shot unit tests.\n 3 - We could experiment with the  command. This may allow us to get around this problem but I believe we wouldn't be able to see an intermediate output for builds.\n I think in the short term we should go with the first solution. Although in the long term I think the second solution is the best.
