Maybe because the pros should have done it.\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "romanoss", "commentT": "2019-06-18T23:20:00Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/romanoss>@romanoss</denchmark-link>\n  - Sorry but I don't know the answer to this question.

Eg in style transfer the produced model can accept images in a size range from 64 to infinity (which means only memory is the limit) - when one uses a 6MPixel image memory usage jumps to over 1 GB :)\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "romanoss", "commentT": "2019-06-19T19:05:48Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/romanoss>@romanoss</denchmark-link>\n  - Thanks for the information.
