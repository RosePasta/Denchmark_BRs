Executions can only be started when we are not AHEAD of the server; when we are AHEAD of the server, we have changes that have not yet propagated to the server. However, as executions are managed by the server (so they can persist between browser sessions), the execution can't be started on the project state on the client as this state does not yet exist on the server.\n The failed execution toast should reflect this error rather than simply saying that it failed (I believe it currently is assuming that an operation failed and the user can get the feedback from the job's stdout)\n \t"}, "comments": {}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "e2d3058de12eab87d16371bba8a30e0e3b81c904", "commit_author": "Brian Broll", "commitT": "2016-09-13 11:21:37-05:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "1.0", "commit_CCN": "1.0", "commit_Nprams": "1.0"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 2, "file_old_name": "src\\common\\viz\\Execute.js", "file_new_name": "src\\common\\viz\\Execute.js", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "144", "file_CCN": "52", "file_NToken": "1112"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "Execute", "method_params": "client,logger", "method_startline": "13", "method_endline": "191", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "19", "method_CCN": "3", "method_NToken": "155", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}, "hunk_1": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "Execute.prototype.runExecutionPlugin", "method_params": "pluginId,opts", "method_startline": "31", "method_endline": "61", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "15", "method_CCN": "5", "method_NToken": "134", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}}}}}}
