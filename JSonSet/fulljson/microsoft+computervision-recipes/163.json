There is really no explanation here on why these specific numbers are used for normalization. It might be good to add explanation here on why these numbers are selected. Otherwise, you can omit mentioning the normalization numbers, as they are not necessary for understanding this notebok.\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "ateste", "commentT": "2019-06-03T15:04:08Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t#close with <denchmark-link:https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/pull/216>#216</denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "719e1fde7bcf85e1e839253dff46aa88f34b22c2", "commit_author": "JS", "commitT": "2019-06-03 11:02:22-04:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "None", "commit_CCN": "None", "commit_Nprams": "None"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "classification\\notebooks\\00_webcam.ipynb", "file_new_name": "classification\\notebooks\\00_webcam.ipynb", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "None", "file_CCN": "None", "file_NToken": "None"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "96", "deleted_lines": "96"}}}}}}
