It was already known to break on the install page, and now it seems it is responsible for <denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12168>#12168</denchmark-link>\n  and <denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11438>#11438</denchmark-link>\n . I created a PR to fix this issue by commenting out this one line:\n <denchmark-code>outstr = str(content).replace('&lt;', '<').replace('&gt;', '>')\n </denchmark-code>\n \n But this ended up stopping the versions dropdown from appearing in the final website output. Having the versions dropdown is more important right now than fixing a couple of render issues, so I've submitted a patch that reverts this change along with an update for site consistency: <denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12426>#12426</denchmark-link>\n \n Browsing the intermediate outputs from this script, you can see things like <span class=\"gp\">>>> </span>.  That's with the line enabled. More research is required to fix this script, so it produces valid html and doesn't break the code block's usage of xml or other tags the require > or <.\n Tracking here as well:\n <denchmark-link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-987>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-987</denchmark-link>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "aaronmarkham", "commentT": "2018-09-12T20:06:10Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for submitting the issue <denchmark-link:https://github.com/aaronmarkham>@aaronmarkham</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/mxnet-label-bot>@mxnet-label-bot</denchmark-link>\n [Website, Build, Installation]\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "aaronmarkham", "commentT": "2018-09-13T23:38:23Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\t<denchmark-link:https://github.com/aaronmarkham>@aaronmarkham</denchmark-link>\n  is this issue still persisting?\n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "aaronmarkham", "commentT": "2018-09-14T00:31:48Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tYes\n \t\t"}, "comments_3": {"comment_id": 4, "comment_author": "aaronmarkham", "commentT": "2019-09-30T17:00:23Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tNew website launch makes this a moot issue.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "5078853650cfe45869b808f3198abc4735b96f25", "commit_author": "Aaron Markham", "commitT": "2019-07-03 12:40:52-07:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "None", "commit_CCN": "None", "commit_Nprams": "None"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "docs\\install\\install-jetson.md", "file_new_name": "docs\\install\\install-jetson.md", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "None", "file_CCN": "None", "file_NToken": "None"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "22", "deleted_lines": "22,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176"}}}}}}
