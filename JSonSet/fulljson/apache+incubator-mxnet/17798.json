The current version of the website also does not label the API version being used. This leads to frustration from the developer community, as the API functions and tutorials may work differently for older MXNet releases. This means that the current version of the Python docs can be considered broken, as developers using older versions of the API may experience errors simply by following the docs and tutorials as they are written and may decide that MXNet is broken.\n It is important to note that this versioning issue is not only limited to the Python API docs, but also applies to the other language API docs and other site content (see features (<denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/features>https://mxnet.apache.org/features</denchmark-link>\n ), setup instructions (<denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/ubuntu_setup>https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/ubuntu_setup</denchmark-link>\n ), etc.).\n At this point in time, there is no way for users to access older versions of the website content and API docs, or even to see which version of MXNet is described by the website content and documentation.\n <denchmark-h:h2>Proposed Resolution</denchmark-h>\n \n To remedy this issue, a general website dropdown should be implemented which will allow users to easily navigate between different versions of the MXNet website using a dropdown menu.\n These changes will be made in the interest of making the website more useful for MXNet developers by adding important missing functionality and content.\n Feedback from the community regarding the proposed implementation is welcome.\n <denchmark-h:h2>Stakeholders</denchmark-h>\n \n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy>@sandeep-krishnamurthy</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/aaronmarkham>@aaronmarkham</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/szha>@szha</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/sojiadeshina>@sojiadeshina</denchmark-link>\n \n <denchmark-h:h2>Proposed Implementation</denchmark-h>\n \n The MXNet website content will default to the latest master, as it currently does. However, in the site header (alongside \u201cGet Started\u201d, \u201cBlog\u201d, \u201cFeatures\u201d, etc.) a dropdown menu will be added which will allow users to select the desired API version:\n <denchmark-link:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25328906/76454724-53c4c180-6392-11ea-8dd3-1649a62dbb46.png></denchmark-link>\n \n Note: in the final version, the dropdown menu will be properly styled with CSS in a manner that is consistent with the rest of the docs.\n The root URL for the website will change from <denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/>https://mxnet.apache.org/</denchmark-link>\n  to <denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/master/>https://mxnet.apache.org/master/</denchmark-link>\n . All relative paths from the root will remain the same. Certain selected versions will be built dynamically to support additional changes, especially to Python docs (master, 1.6, 2.x, etc.), while older versions will be served as static artifacts.

Currently, each of the other language API docs (Java, Scala, etc.) have their own format, and based on the conversations that we have had with the developer community we believe that it would be best to leave the format of these other docs unchanged.

Unique installation instructions (not building from source) for individual versions of MXNet are already supported and showcased on the website (for example, <denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started?version=v0.11.0&platform=linux&language=python&processor=cpu&environ=pip&>installation instructions for v0.11.0</denchmark-link>\n ).\n Regarding the content at <denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/features>https://mxnet.apache.org/features</denchmark-link>\n , creating a working version of each of the current code samples for the old releases of MXNet would not be possible. For example, the Horovod feature code example for distributed training is based on functionality only recently added to MXNet. If we were to add a general website dropdown, we would need to create entirely new feature code samples for each version, which would be outside the scope of this project.\n We scoped this project by prioritizing the minimum but most critical functionality that is broken today for any MXNet user coming to the website, with a maximum project duration of 4 weeks. Since >80% of MXNet developers use the Python API, it was decided that the project should focus on versioning the Python API docs. As mentioned above, a general website dropdown would require additional supporting content for each version (such as the <denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/features>features page</denchmark-link>\n ), necessitating a more extended timeline and continued support/maintenance once the project is completed. The general website dropdown is something that can be added to the list of Future Work projects for Website 2.0 (to be completed once more engineers are added to the project), but I believe that the most critical priority (and the focus of this project) should remain fixing the Python API docs as soon as possible.\n \t\t"}, "comments_5": {"comment_id": 6, "comment_author": "connorgoggins", "commentT": "2020-03-10T21:17:46Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks <denchmark-link:https://github.com/connorgoggins>@connorgoggins</denchmark-link>\n  for clarifying.\n \n @leezu after discussing with @sojiadeshina, we decided that it's ok to have the setup instructions (build from source) only apply to master\n \n I disagree.

Users downloading one of our stable releases at <denchmark-link:https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/download>https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/download</denchmark-link>\n  have no way to find instructions on how to compile and install it.

Much of this content does not currently exist, and would require time to develop and test before publishing to the website. Even considering just the other language API docs, each requires a specific build process, and there are errors with each of them that need to be resolved. Because this project has a maximum timeline of 4 weeks, it would not be possible for one engineer (myself) to add all of this additional content in addition to reworking the fundamental structure of the website to support multiple versions.\n The stated objective of this project is to implement the minimum but most critical functionality that is broken today for any MXNet user coming to the website. This functionality has been decided to be the Python API docs, which >80% of our users rely on for MXNet development. The goal is to implement this functionality as soon as possible, since the current Python docs are considered broken.

I could try to generate pdfs for old R versions if there was demand.\n Anyways, for the C, Scala, Clojure, Java, and Julia microsites, we just grab those and deploy them as static assets.\n If you want to fix C and split out C and C++ APIs, then we'll need to create some custom Doxyfiles for that and split the pipeline into two... maybe add a new tile for that. I'd leave that for later though.\n For the Python versions, I'd focus on current stable, 1.7+ and master (2.x). If we want the old ones then just keep the old look and feel for when those get launched.
