This type is used to encode dimensions of shapes internally.\n In 1.3.1, a \"-1\"  therefore was interpreted as unsigned(-1) which is basically max_int. In 1.4.0 and later it is interpreted as \"-1\" and that changed the behaviour of the operator.\n It is debatable whether we ever wanted to explicitly allow the use of \"-1\" in the shape argument of the operator. At least I as the original author had this not in mind and also the documentation does not say anything about magic numbers. In fact, the only case where the operator did work (and could ever work) with magic numbers is when \"-1\" is specified as first coordinate.  Nothing else is possible.\n Two solutions:\n \n We document that it is o.k. to use \"-1\" as first shape coordinate in ravel/unravel_index. And enhance the operator to support this. That does not require any change for \"ravel\" and a simple change in the code shown below.\n We leave it as is (the code simply does not support this). A potential workaround for customers would be to specify a huge number except \"-1\" for the first dimension which has essentially the same effect.\n \n <denchmark-code>struct unravel_index {\n   template<typename DType>\n   MSHADOW_XINLINE static void Map(int i, index_t N, index_t ndim, index_t *shape,\n                                   DType *unravelled, DType *ravelled) {\n     index_t idx(ravelled[i]);\n     #pragma unroll\n     for (int j = ndim; j--; ) {\n       index_t tmp = idx / shape[j];\n       unravelled[i+j*N] = idx - tmp*shape[j];\n       idx = tmp;\n     }\n   }\n };\n </denchmark-code>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_5": {"comment_id": 6, "comment_author": "fhieber", "commentT": "2019-03-06T14:01:19Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tOh thank you so much! This is quite hilarious - we relied on exploiting this undocumented behavior without knowing :)\n For Sockeye this means that we can update to 1.4.0 immediately and make this exploit of range overflow explicit by using shape=(sys.maxsize, y) in our code instead of shape=(-1, y). We rely on this functionality because we cannot infer the first shape value (batch size) in a HybridBlock in our case. As such, I would vote for going with option 1, explicitly supporting it in the future.\n \t\t"}, "comments_6": {"comment_id": 7, "comment_author": "fhieber", "commentT": "2019-03-07T09:52:14Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tPR <denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14356>#14356</denchmark-link>\n  will fix this.\n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "35098b8ad27e5151fc266fbf1a766d937bd9ec8e", "commit_author": "moin", "commitT": "2019-03-11 11:53:30+08:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "0.0", "commit_CCN": "1.0", "commit_Nprams": "0.8571428571428571"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "src\\operator\\tensor\\ravel.cc", "file_new_name": "src\\operator\\tensor\\ravel.cc", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "54", "file_CCN": "0", "file_NToken": "361"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "34,40,59,65", "deleted_lines": "34,58"}}}, "file_1": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "src\\operator\\tensor\\ravel.h", "file_new_name": "src\\operator\\tensor\\ravel.h", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "127", "file_CCN": "13", "file_NToken": "1323"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "113,118", "deleted_lines": "113", "method_info": {"method_name": "mxnet::op::unravel_index::Map", "method_params": "i,N,ndim,shape,unravelled,ravelled", "method_startline": "109", "method_endline": "119", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "10", "method_CCN": "2", "method_NToken": "91", "method_nesting_level": "3"}}}}}, "file_2": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 1, "file_old_name": "tests\\python\\unittest\\test_operator.py", "file_new_name": "tests\\python\\unittest\\test_operator.py", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "6284", "file_CCN": "1005", "file_NToken": "78997"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 1, "added_lines": "7109,7110,7111,7112,7113,7114,7115", "deleted_lines": null, "method_info": {"method_name": "test_ravel", "method_params": "", "method_startline": "7095", "method_endline": "7115", "method_complexity": {"method_NLOC": "16", "method_CCN": "2", "method_NToken": "223", "method_nesting_level": "0"}}}}}}}}
