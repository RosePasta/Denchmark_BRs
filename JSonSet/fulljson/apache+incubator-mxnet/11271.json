However, both returned meaningful results under the respective assumption to to treat nan as top value or to ignore nan values. Currently topk treats the whole order of the array as being undefined if it contains any nan value.

All the rest is undefined. Which is kind of o.k. as having NaN in any array is likely a severe problem (see all the issues in MxNet where people got suddenly an NaN during training and see this as a bug).\n While I agree that it would be desirable to standardize NaN handling, I think\n \n whatever we do, it must be documented. Otherwise we don't have a written convention and things may change erratically all the time.\n Labeling such issues as \"bug\" is not correct. It can only be a bug if it violates a defined behavior\n Whatever we do, it should be consistent across all comparison operators (max, min, broadcast_greater, .....). Which could mean that we won't find any consistent solution that does not alter the behavior of at least one of such operators.\n If we can't come up with consistent handling, then NaN should be declared has having undefined behaviour whenever encountered in comparisons in MXNet\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "leezu", "commentT": "2018-08-25T18:00:52Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI opened a PR to document this in the v1.3 release notes: <denchmark-link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12357>#12357</denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}}}, "commit": {"commit_id": "7b0258e863f77f9a84a3acab97215cbd8f15503e", "commit_author": "Leonard Lausen", "commitT": "2018-08-25 12:38:35-07:00", "commit_complexity": {"commit_NLOC": "None", "commit_CCN": "None", "commit_Nprams": "None"}, "changed_files": {"file_0": {"file_change_type": "MODIFY", "file_Nmethod": 0, "file_old_name": "NEWS.md", "file_new_name": "NEWS.md", "file_complexity": {"file_NLOC": "None", "file_CCN": "None", "file_NToken": "None"}, "hunks": {"hunk_0": {"Ismethod": 0, "added_lines": "113", "deleted_lines": "113"}}}}}}
