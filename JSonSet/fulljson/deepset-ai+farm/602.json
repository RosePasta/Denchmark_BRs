The answers in the Squad dataset are on average only 10 words long. Also, in Squad, answers more often come at the beginning of passages rather than at the end. This might partially explain why your model does better when the answer is at the beginning of the document.\n \n \n Another angle into this is to do with the sliding window used in QA systems. Long contexts, like the ones you've shown, are split into smaller, overlapping passages. This is so that they can be processed by the transformer models which are limited in the length of their input. The size of this input is set by a max_seq_len parameter. Models cannot return answers that are longer than max_seq_len, and often they are constrained to return answers that are significantly shorter. If you are using a FARM QAInferencer, the default max_seq_len is 256. You could try increasing this to 384 and seeing if that helps.\n \n \n Let us know if this helps or not!\n \t\t"}, "comments_4": {"comment_id": 5, "comment_author": "mdliyakat-dev", "commentT": "2020-11-18T13:54:54Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tClosing this for now.
