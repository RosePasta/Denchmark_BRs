Therefore, I set the eval_every variable to 0 in my experiment-json (as suggested in the description in the json) . Unfortunately, this leads to a ZeroDivisionError as listed below. It seems to me, an additional conditional statement (self.evaluate_every != 0) in line 249 of train.py would resolve this issue. I was able to perform my experiment by setting it to a number, larger than the total training steps, but this is just fighting the symptoms.\n Thanks guys and keep up the great work!\n Error message\n <denchmark-code>/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/farm/train.py in train(self)\n     247 \n     248                 # Perform  evaluation\n --> 249                 if self.global_step % self.evaluate_every == 0 and self.global_step != 0:\n     250                     # When using StreamingDataSilo, each evaluation creates a new instance of\n     251                     # dev_data_loader.
