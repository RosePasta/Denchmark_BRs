Not about docker\n Did you check if you question is answered in the troubleshooting guide? Not in the guide\n \n Bug report:\n Please describe erroneous behavior you're observing and steps to reproduce it.\n When running horovodrun from the terminal, you can pass a hostfile with, -hostfile/--hostfile. If you use --verbose, you can see the equivalent Open MPI command. I noticed that horovodrun converts the --hostfile to -H for hosts. This isn't an exact conversion from horovodrun to mpirun, and for some reason is causing issues in my environment.\n I installed openmpi with yum. There's some kind of weird bug that I haven't fully figured out yet where specifying just the host with -H causes the ORTE was unable to reliably start one or more daemons. error, but --hostfile does not cause this issue. However, because horovodrun translates both --hostfiles and -H to mpirun -H, horovodrun will not work. Because I installed openmpi from yum and didn't make any changes, I thought this may be an important bug to note for others who may also run into this issue.\n Example from the <denchmark-link:https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mpirun.html>documentation</denchmark-link>\n :\n \n Equivalent:\n <denchmark-code>mpirun -np 16 \\\n     -H server1:4,server2:4,server3:4,server4:4 \\\n     -bind-to none -map-by slot \\\n     -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH \\\n     -mca pml ob1 -mca btl ^openib \\\n     python train.py\n </denchmark-code>\n \n However,\n horovodrun -np 16 --hostfile hostfile python train.py\n is not equivalent to:\n <denchmark-code>mpirun -np 16 \\\n     --hostfile hostfile \\\n     -bind-to none -map-by slot \\\n     -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH \\\n     -mca pml ob1 -mca btl ^openib \\\n     python train.py\n </denchmark-code>\n \n but is equivalent to the original, which in my case, causes problems, not sure why.\n <denchmark-code>mpirun -np 16 \\\n     -H server1:4,server2:4,server3:4,server4:4 \\\n     -bind-to none -map-by slot \\\n     -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -x PATH \\\n     -mca pml ob1 -mca btl ^openib \\\n     python train.py\n </denchmark-code>\n \n I'm recompiling mpi.
