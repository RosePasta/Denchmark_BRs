It seems that Polyaxon's config parser assumes that the presence of a colon always means the end of the registry endpoint + docker image name and the start of the docker image tag. This is not always the case.\n To reproduce, simply point Polyaxon to a docker registry which is exposed with a port number rather than plain 80/443-exposed.\n <denchmark-h:h3>Expected behaviour</denchmark-h>\n \n Polyaxon should use a smarter regex to parse docker images. Perhaps a better assumption to make would be that the last colon in the string is what separates the registry + image name and the tag.\n <denchmark-h:h3>Environment</denchmark-h>\n \n Any/all environments\n <denchmark-h:h3>Error</denchmark-h>\n \n <denchmark-code>{'_schema': ['Invalid docker image registry.foobar.com:4567/my/docker/image:latest\u2019]}\n </denchmark-code>\n \n \t"}, "comments": {"comments_0": {"comment_id": 1, "comment_author": "ghost(ghost)", "commentT": "2018-11-21T13:51:45Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tI've dug through the code and the problematic line is here:\n <denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-schemas/blob/804d01e96c4101f65d6c1dd9a6da75db4027a080/polyaxon_schemas/build.py#L20>https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-schemas/blob/804d01e96c4101f65d6c1dd9a6da75db4027a080/polyaxon_schemas/build.py#L20</denchmark-link>\n \n I will happily make a pull request to fix this :)\n \t\t"}, "comments_1": {"comment_id": 2, "comment_author": "ghost(ghost)", "commentT": "2018-11-21T13:57:18Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks for the proposition, you should fix the issue in this line as well <denchmark-link:https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-schemas/blob/804d01e96c4101f65d6c1dd9a6da75db4027a080/polyaxon_schemas/build.py#L79>https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-schemas/blob/804d01e96c4101f65d6c1dd9a6da75db4027a080/polyaxon_schemas/build.py#L79</denchmark-link>\n \n \t\t"}, "comments_2": {"comment_id": 3, "comment_author": "ghost(ghost)", "commentT": "2018-11-21T14:07:13Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tThanks <denchmark-link:https://github.com/mouradmourafiq>@mouradmourafiq</denchmark-link>\n  , I've now fixed it there too\n \t\t"}, "comments_3": {"comment_id": 4, "comment_author": "ghost(ghost)", "commentT": "2018-11-23T21:00:00Z", "comment_text": "\n \t\tClosing this as it's already merged.
